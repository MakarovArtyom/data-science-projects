Wine Pairings,  were very well thought out.  And the Discovery Pairing lives up to its name.  The wines whisked me from Austraila, Japan, and to the Czech Republic, to name a few.Our servers Maria were Dian fantastic.  Our Maitre'D, Vincenzo (Of Naples) recognized that I was genuinely in love with the menu and gave me a tour of the restaurant, I even met the Chef's.Hide,  Bravo Bravo!!!"	it s been awhile  since i ve reviewed a restaurant   hide  above   because there are three distinct levels is a wonderful  new  bright  and well thought out restaurant   i had the pre fixed dinner with the  discovery  wine pairing i was blown away by this seven course meal   i m lying   i took advantage of the optionap course  foie gras  this restaurant has only been open since april 2018 and they already have a michelin star   bravo here are the highlights    baby leek soup with truffle and truffle oil   great first course  gently cook egg   this was soooooo decadent and perfect   it was served on hide s signature cloche and nest  wagyu beef in ox broth   wow   served raw and lightly cooked in the broth   delicious  baked alaska   fun  fun  fun   this dessert take awhile so they ll have you order it in the beginning  wine pairings   were very well thought out   and the discovery pairing lives up to its name   the wines whisked me from austraila  japan  and to the czech republic  to name a few our servers maria were dian fantastic   our maitre d  vincenzo  of naples  recognized that i was genuinely in love with the menu and gave me a tour of the restaurant  i even met the chef s hide   bravo bravo   
1	4.0	Good food, great vibes, but overpriced.GROUND- The food is creative in taste and presentation, I had the chicken liver parfait - bread to parfait ratio was baddeer tartare - presented like mini tacos and had minimal deer inside for the price point black truffle pasta - which was my favorite dish (but have you ever had a bad pasta and black truffle dish?) split pea soup - I appreciated the craftsmanship, but it didn't leave me wowed.BAR- Amazing cocktail and wine menu, super sexy vibes, and interactive mixologists who add to the experience.	good food  great vibes  but overpriced ground  the food is creative in taste and presentation  i had the chicken liver parfait   bread to parfait ratio was baddeer tartare   presented like mini tacos and had minimal deer inside for the price point black truffle pasta   which was my favorite dish  but have you ever had a bad pasta and black truffle dish   split pea soup   i appreciated the craftsmanship  but it didn t leave me wowed bar  amazing cocktail and wine menu  super sexy vibes  and interactive mixologists who add to the experience

4	5.0	"Wow!  This is a great ""find"".  We started with a cocktail at the bar on the lowest floor and we then had a relaxing dinner at Ground with delicious food.  The attention to detail is remarkable (in decor, drink and food) and they somehow made the delicate balance where you felt like you were having a special meal but it was not pretentious or stuffy.  The table shared simple starters (and the flatbread was great). I then had a burrata dish and then a monkfish dish and then I ended with acorn cake.  If you want a ""yelp worthy"" photo, order the scallop ceviche.  Trust me.  Everything was delightful and the restaurant had a great buzz on a Monday.  Later in the week must get even better!"	wow   this is a great  find    we started with a cocktail at the bar on the lowest floor and we then had a relaxing dinner at ground with delicious food   the attention to detail is remarkable  in decor  drink and food  and they somehow made the delicate balance where you felt like you were having a special meal but it was not pretentious or stuffy   the table shared simple starters  and the flatbread was great   i then had a burrata dish and then a monkfish dish and then i ended with acorn cake   if you want a  yelp worthy  photo  order the scallop ceviche   trust me   everything was delightful and the restaurant had a great buzz on a monday   later in the week must get even better 
5	4.0	The Hide is an interesting new restaurant in central London offering two different restaurants on it's two levels with separate menus, as well as a bar in the basement. I only ate at the ground level restaurant, and I was fairly disappointed in the roast chicken as I thought it wasn't up to the quality of a nice restaurant. I appear to be in good company as in the 3 weeks since I visited it seems to have been taken off the menu on the website. Overall I'd say this place was great with a cosy atmosphere right in the heart of London. The Acorn cake dessert is a must try, it is like a large danish pastry (but drier and with more texture) served hot with a choice of liquors to pour over the cake. I've never tried anything like it and would love to come by and have it again.	the hide is an interesting new restaurant in central london offering two different restaurants on it s two levels with separate menus  as well as a bar in the basement  i only ate at the ground level restaurant  and i was fairly disappointed in the roast chicken as i thought it wasn t up to the quality of a nice restaurant  i appear to be in good company as in the 3 weeks since i visited it seems to have been taken off the menu on the website  overall i d say this place was great with a cosy atmosphere right in the heart of london  the acorn cake dessert is a must try  it is like a large danish pastry  but drier and with more texture  served hot with a choice of liquors to pour over the cake  i ve never tried anything like it and would love to come by and have it again 
6	5.0	Ollie Dabbous has done it again. The exemplary culinary techniques, flavours and service of his previous eponymous restaurant have been effortlessly transported to 85 Piccadilly. There are three spaces named below, ground and above, serving different fare. Breakfast below, a la carte on the ground and degustations above. The masculine interior, framed with giant wooden doors, bronzed metal fittings and an amazing sculptural staircase are offset by the more feminine floor to ceiling view of green park and the amorphous, dreamy attire of the wait staff. If you are dining above, you have the choice of a lunchtime menu (currently 42 pounds) and the full eight course menu (twice that). The former might seem pricey, but if you've dined at Dabbous' restaurants, you'll know its good value, by the time you receive your multiple amuse bouches and petit fours, you'll come away more than satisfied. Clever design extends to the menu - 'hidden' inside an embossed folder and an iPad-based wine list linked to a nearby wine store, from which the staff can bring you anything you desire with ten minutes notice and decant it to perfection. With quiet, gentle and persistent attention, you will feel well looked after as you ooh and aah at each dish (which I know I haven't even yet described). I won't spoil all the thrills, but I'll say the mushroom broth was true umami unctuousness; the house-cured goose and pork served on a feather and china bone were exquisite; the beetroot tartare was perfectly balanced between the sweetness of the beetroot, the crunchiness of the pistachio base, the coolness of the cream and the warmth of the horseradish; and the chocolate stout egg was layers of malty goodness wrapped in a cool and crunchy shell, lying upon a delicate nest of milk chocolate, surrounded by toasted rice dipped in gold leaf. Now, for all its fanciness, I dare you to find me a better meal in all of London!	ollie dabbous has done it again  the exemplary culinary techniques  flavours and service of his previous eponymous restaurant have been effortlessly transported to 85 piccadilly  there are three spaces named below  ground and above  serving different fare  breakfast below  a la carte on the ground and degustations above  the masculine interior  framed with giant wooden doors  bronzed metal fittings and an amazing sculptural staircase are offset by the more feminine floor to ceiling view of green park and the amorphous  dreamy attire of the wait staff  if you are dining above  you have the choice of a lunchtime menu  currently 42 pounds  and the full eight course menu  twice that   the former might seem pricey  but if you ve dined at dabbous  restaurants  you ll know its good value  by the time you receive your multiple amuse bouches and petit fours  you ll come away more than satisfied  clever design extends to the menu    hidden  inside an embossed folder and an ipad based wine list linked to a nearby wine store  from which the staff can bring you anything you desire with ten minutes notice and decant it to perfection  with quiet  gentle and persistent attention  you will feel well looked after as you ooh and aah at each dish  which i know i haven t even yet described   i won t spoil all the thrills  but i ll say the mushroom broth was true umami unctuousness  the house cured goose and pork served on a feather and china bone were exquisite  the beetroot tartare was perfectly balanced between the sweetness of the beetroot  the crunchiness of the pistachio base  the coolness of the cream and the warmth of the horseradish  and the chocolate stout egg was layers of malty goodness wrapped in a cool and crunchy shell  lying upon a delicate nest of milk chocolate  surrounded by toasted rice dipped in gold leaf  now  for all its fanciness  i dare you to find me a better meal in all of london 
7	5.0	Hide has 3 levels: this review is for Hide Above. For starters, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, with a spectacular staircase leading you to the upper dining room. This perfectly sets the stage for a wonderful dinner: our tasting menu with wine pairing was nothing short of phenomenal. Each of the dishes was masterfully prepared and presented and the wines perfectly matched. Service was superb with all of the attendants making sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay. As an added bonus, we were invited to meet the staff and tour the kitchen--what a wonderful way to end a great dining experience! Definitely worth a visit if you are looking for something special.	hide has 3 levels  this review is for hide above  for starters  the restaurant itself is gorgeous  with a spectacular staircase leading you to the upper dining room  this perfectly sets the stage for a wonderful dinner  our tasting menu with wine pairing was nothing short of phenomenal  each of the dishes was masterfully prepared and presented and the wines perfectly matched  service was superb with all of the attendants making sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay  as an added bonus  we were invited to meet the staff and tour the kitchen  what a wonderful way to end a great dining experience  definitely worth a visit if you are looking for something special 
8	5.0	Had lunch with my hubbyFive star. It's new restaurant in town. As its name Hide, à main door is hidden. It's concept is very unique. They have phone charger that's hidden in each dining table. I'm pretty sure lots hidden features are in this venue.We had a la cart lunch menu. The interior reminds me of egg shell. Appetizer is with raw but carefully seasoned vegetables with broth. It's clean food and new but trendy concept. It's colorful and table wear is also pretty. Broth is mild and pretty sure lots hidden taste is involved. I had pork for main that was nicely decorated and presented. It wasn't heavy, lightly cooked. Bit of crunchiness was the accent. Chocolate egg cream dessert was also unique as its  content is hidden that was unforgettable I remember exactly how it tasted with cream and chocolate. The view of Green Park is plus. Venue concept as well as the service and whole customer experience is superb. 5 stars with no further justification.	had lunch with my hubbyfive star  it s new restaurant in town  as its name hide    main door is hidden  it s concept is very unique  they have phone charger that s hidden in each dining table  i m pretty sure lots hidden features are in this venue we had a la cart lunch menu  the interior reminds me of egg shell  appetizer is with raw but carefully seasoned vegetables with broth  it s clean food and new but trendy concept  it s colorful and table wear is also pretty  broth is mild and pretty sure lots hidden taste is involved  i had pork for main that was nicely decorated and presented  it wasn t heavy  lightly cooked  bit of crunchiness was the accent  chocolate egg cream dessert was also unique as its  content is hidden that was unforgettable i remember exactly how it tasted with cream and chocolate  the view of green park is plus  venue concept as well as the service and whole customer experience is superb  5 stars with no further justification 
9	4.0	I hadn't been here since a few incarnations and so stopped in before dinner a few weeks ago to grab a cocktail.  Interestingly, they do not have a full liquor license so you have to order some amount of food with your drink but the olives are made for that need and perfect to the role.  I had the blunderbuss which was solid but sadly had to run before trying anything else.	i hadn t been here since a few incarnations and so stopped in before dinner a few weeks ago to grab a cocktail   interestingly  they do not have a full liquor license so you have to order some amount of food with your drink but the olives are made for that need and perfect to the role   i had the blunderbuss which was solid but sadly had to run before trying anything else 
10	5.0	A treasure find in Piccadilly/Buckingham vicinity. Excellent and artistic dishes, wide array of wine selections and impeccable customer service talent. This place is managed extremely well, the staff has a good grip of what it takes to be in a customer service oriented establishment, they do care for their customer and aim for professionalism and customer service. Will definitely be back here.	a treasure find in piccadilly buckingham vicinity  excellent and artistic dishes  wide array of wine selections and impeccable customer service talent  this place is managed extremely well  the staff has a good grip of what it takes to be in a customer service oriented establishment  they do care for their customer and aim for professionalism and customer service  will definitely be back here 
11	5.0	When dim sum have a Michelin star!While I wasn't blown away (except for the custard buns) it's dim sums in it's most refined and creative level for a rather good price! If you manage to get a table, you should most definitely go!!We shared a few of the dim sums and snacks first:Chengdu Street Tofu (very nice), Shangai steamed dumpling ( like xao long bao), Sechuanese chicken and peanut bonbon, Wagyu tart with black beans, Isle of Mull seared scallop and cheung fun, Steamed duck yolk custard bun (a must order), Pork and prawn dumpling, wild mushroom and truffle steamed buns, clear shrimp dumpling and rabbit and carrot glutinous.We also shared a crispy duck and Singapour noodles.Overall I would say certain dishes and presentation deserve the Michelin star but others may not be as up to par. However this is fine Chinese food for a fairly democratic price and it was delicious enough that I would love to come back if I ever manage to get a table again	when dim sum have a michelin star while i wasn t blown away  except for the custard buns  it s dim sums in it s most refined and creative level for a rather good price  if you manage to get a table  you should most definitely go  we shared a few of the dim sums and snacks first chengdu street tofu  very nice   shangai steamed dumpling   like xao long bao   sechuanese chicken and peanut bonbon  wagyu tart with black beans  isle of mull seared scallop and cheung fun  steamed duck yolk custard bun  a must order   pork and prawn dumpling  wild mushroom and truffle steamed buns  clear shrimp dumpling and rabbit and carrot glutinous we also shared a crispy duck and singapour noodles overall i would say certain dishes and presentation deserve the michelin star but others may not be as up to par  however this is fine chinese food for a fairly democratic price and it was delicious enough that i would love to come back if i ever manage to get a table again
12	1.0	They denied us because we didn't have a reservation, so we ended up eating at a nearby restaurant.  We finished our meal and walked by A Wong only to see the restaurant only half full. What a disappointment that they could not take our number or give us the option to book for a later time/date. It all seemed a little odd and not at all right.	they denied us because we didn t have a reservation  so we ended up eating at a nearby restaurant   we finished our meal and walked by a wong only to see the restaurant only half full  what a disappointment that they could not take our number or give us the option to book for a later time date  it all seemed a little odd and not at all right 
13	4.0	A terrific degustatory experience, & well worth seeking out. Its easy to have slight misgivings when you pull up (this part of Pimlico is less than lovely...), or when you walk in (no white linen table cloths here!). Don't be. The staff are lovely & very attentive, & the food is inventive, beautiful, & really delicious! The dim sum we ate (Xiaolongbao-style dumplings, chive potstickers, Szechuan wonton, and other delicious things). The Szechuan chicken bonbon was far and away the star!Our hostess recommended the lamb burger, and we mistakenly chose the Peking duck. It wasn't great for us, as we found it a bit dry (we're spoiled, having eaten at Mott 32 in HK). Definitely go, its worth it!	a terrific degustatory experience    well worth seeking out  its easy to have slight misgivings when you pull up  this part of pimlico is less than lovely      or when you walk in  no white linen table cloths here    don t be  the staff are lovely   very attentive    the food is inventive  beautiful    really delicious  the dim sum we ate  xiaolongbao style dumplings  chive potstickers  szechuan wonton  and other delicious things   the szechuan chicken bonbon was far and away the star our hostess recommended the lamb burger  and we mistakenly chose the peking duck  it wasn t great for us  as we found it a bit dry  we re spoiled  having eaten at mott 32 in hk   definitely go  its worth it

16	5.0	Went with two friends, including one who does not like Chinese food, and we were amazed how good it was. Went with the tasting menu and it was an incredible trip across China. Dishes from different regions with great explanations. Many excellent courses but the soup dumplings really jumped out. Tried some interesting dishes also but none were too challenging that I avoided them. It was a great menu at a reasonable cost. Also impressed with the wine list, many good choices in the 20-40 range. Went with a Gigondas that worked perfectly with the tasting menu.	went with two friends  including one who does not like chinese food  and we were amazed how good it was  went with the tasting menu and it was an incredible trip across china  dishes from different regions with great explanations  many excellent courses but the soup dumplings really jumped out  tried some interesting dishes also but none were too challenging that i avoided them  it was a great menu at a reasonable cost  also impressed with the wine list  many good choices in the 20 40 range  went with a gigondas that worked perfectly with the tasting menu 
17	5.0	A.Wong was a special find during our London stay - delicious and elegant dim sum for reasonable prices (at least compared to San Francisco) :P One of our favorite things about A.Wong was that the dim sum menu was priced per piece, so we were able to order exactly the amount we were able to eat. Typical dim sum restaurants always serve their dishes in portions of three, and we've never been able to enjoy the full selection of the menu as a party of two.A couple of our favorites from A.Wong:- Shrimp Dumpling, Sweet Chili Sauce, and Citrus Foam - loved the bright acidity of the citrus.- Honey Baked Pork Pasty- Steamed Duck Yolk Custard Bun (presented like a peach)- Shanghai Steamed Dumpling with Ginger Infused Vinegar - very juicy though the skins got stuck together and we broke the dumpling :(Given that we were ordering piece by piece, we were able to try the entire menu (except for the rabbit puff). We do wish that there were more vegetable/steamed options available on the menu, but dim sum traditionally has more starchy, fried courses. Overall, we felt like that this was a fantastic dining experience, and are looking forward to trying out more dim sum the next time we're in London!	a wong was a special find during our london stay   delicious and elegant dim sum for reasonable prices  at least compared to san francisco   p one of our favorite things about a wong was that the dim sum menu was priced per piece  so we were able to order exactly the amount we were able to eat  typical dim sum restaurants always serve their dishes in portions of three  and we ve never been able to enjoy the full selection of the menu as a party of two a couple of our favorites from a wong   shrimp dumpling  sweet chili sauce  and citrus foam   loved the bright acidity of the citrus   honey baked pork pasty  steamed duck yolk custard bun  presented like a peach   shanghai steamed dumpling with ginger infused vinegar   very juicy though the skins got stuck together and we broke the dumpling   given that we were ordering piece by piece  we were able to try the entire menu  except for the rabbit puff   we do wish that there were more vegetable steamed options available on the menu  but dim sum traditionally has more starchy  fried courses  overall  we felt like that this was a fantastic dining experience  and are looking forward to trying out more dim sum the next time we re in london 
18	1.0	Boy, I wish I could put zero stars..for 3 days I called this place during business hours and no one answered the phone..I could not make a reservation. We went anyway on a Sat night. Not a great neighborhood at all. Went in and 5 tables were open and we were told they were booked all night. They didn't seem to care how much I called them or that I wanted a table...I have no problem sharing their bad service issues.	boy  i wish i could put zero stars  for 3 days i called this place during business hours and no one answered the phone  i could not make a reservation  we went anyway on a sat night  not a great neighborhood at all  went in and 5 tables were open and we were told they were booked all night  they didn t seem to care how much i called them or that i wanted a table   i have no problem sharing their bad service issues 
19	5.0	A lovely light meal here. I sat at the bar which was perfect for the solo diner. The staff was attentive and friendly. I started with the Peking cocktail...champagne, citrus puree with candy floss sprayed with an atomizer of cognac. Delicious and so very pretty.I just had a couple of small plates, the chengdu street tofu (almost wished I had made a double order). It had so much flavor in such a small bowl. Could have definitely eaten more. Then I had the crab and seafood in braised leaves...wow. The broth was so flavorful that I wanted to tilt the bowl and drink it. Very very delicious and surprisingly filling for such a delicate dish.After dinner I decided on another drink so I went downstairs to the Forbidden City bar in their basement (only access through the restaurant). The decor was very early 20th century opium den and the staff was again great. They have a specialty old fashioned on their menu that contains duck fat. I had a standard old fashioned (my bartender's 1st!) and it was delicious. The perfect ending to my first night in London.Even though I was there on a Thursday, the restaurant was very crowded, but it isn't a huge space.

21	4.0	"All I can say is that A. Wong's steamed duck yolk custard bun is worthy enough ""to die for"". It's a shame that they don't allow take away or I would easily have a dozen of these to take away everyday if I could. Anyway, salivating over this bun aside, all the dim sum here is delicate, well prepared and presented, and generally of a standard you would expect considering the price tag attached. But, I repeat, for a bun-lover like me, their custard bun is far and away their knock-out hit."	all i can say is that a  wong s steamed duck yolk custard bun is worthy enough  to die for   it s a shame that they don t allow take away or i would easily have a dozen of these to take away everyday if i could  anyway  salivating over this bun aside  all the dim sum here is delicate  well prepared and presented  and generally of a standard you would expect considering the price tag attached  but  i repeat  for a bun lover like me  their custard bun is far and away their knock out hit

23	4.0	My husband and I came here for dinner. We stumbled across the find through Yelp and it was only a short distance walk from our hotel. We tried going here for dinner last night and they were completely packed! Disappointed but sure to return we made reservations for the following night. The atmosphere is very hip and young. The food is trendy and beautifully made. The flavors are there in every fish. We ordered the dim sum and egg waffle for apps and shared the garlic lobster and egg fried rice for the main course. I did feel that the food was overpriced but for a Michelin star restaurant I would guess that makes sense.	my husband and i came here for dinner  we stumbled across the find through yelp and it was only a short distance walk from our hotel  we tried going here for dinner last night and they were completely packed  disappointed but sure to return we made reservations for the following night  the atmosphere is very hip and young  the food is trendy and beautifully made  the flavors are there in every fish  we ordered the dim sum and egg waffle for apps and shared the garlic lobster and egg fried rice for the main course  i did feel that the food was overpriced but for a michelin star restaurant i would guess that makes sense 
24	5.0	It was total luck that we stopped in here for last meal in London this trip.  And so I think it was a little bit of fate that let us partake of some very tasty and interesting things.  The hints of modernist techniques with care in choosing items made this a lovely experience.  I just wish I lived near by to go back and enjoy other things on the rest of the menu, but going for the biggest variety, we decided to do the 10 course dim sum tasting menu.  It was an excellent choice.I enjoyed everything, but there were some real stand outs.  The 62 degree egg is of course cool and tasty, but I have a thing for eggs and I've been experimenting with these so it is great to see one in action.  The the soup dumplings are among the best I've had, and I've had a lot. The tapioca pearls were a nice touch and something different than roe.   One thing that was very simple and very good was the mixed greens with shrimp butter and fermented tofu.  A really enjoyable dish with a depth of flavor.  The lamb burger was very nicely done and super flavorful.  Desserts were creative and tasty.  Probably the best thing was the Yunnan seared beef with mint.  This was like a party in your mouth!  Well balanced, full of flavor, the beef was great, the mint fried to add to a bit of fun and flavor.  I could probably eat this everyday for a week.  totally enjoyed the hints of modernist techniques in this mean and the depth of flavors.  This is a must go to place next time I'm in London and a place to tell your friends about.  If you are looking for something refined and interesting this is the place.  Service was excellent and the smells coming from the open air kitchen made me hungry for more and got me guessing about the next dish that was about to come out.	it was total luck that we stopped in here for last meal in london this trip   and so i think it was a little bit of fate that let us partake of some very tasty and interesting things   the hints of modernist techniques with care in choosing items made this a lovely experience   i just wish i lived near by to go back and enjoy other things on the rest of the menu  but going for the biggest variety  we decided to do the 10 course dim sum tasting menu   it was an excellent choice i enjoyed everything  but there were some real stand outs   the 62 degree egg is of course cool and tasty  but i have a thing for eggs and i ve been experimenting with these so it is great to see one in action   the the soup dumplings are among the best i ve had  and i ve had a lot  the tapioca pearls were a nice touch and something different than roe    one thing that was very simple and very good was the mixed greens with shrimp butter and fermented tofu   a really enjoyable dish with a depth of flavor   the lamb burger was very nicely done and super flavorful   desserts were creative and tasty   probably the best thing was the yunnan seared beef with mint   this was like a party in your mouth   well balanced  full of flavor  the beef was great  the mint fried to add to a bit of fun and flavor   i could probably eat this everyday for a week   totally enjoyed the hints of modernist techniques in this mean and the depth of flavors   this is a must go to place next time i m in london and a place to tell your friends about   if you are looking for something refined and interesting this is the place   service was excellent and the smells coming from the open air kitchen made me hungry for more and got me guessing about the next dish that was about to come out 
25	3.0	So I went to A-wong again. Do not order the 8 spices Chicken. It is served at room temperature and the chicken tastes like boiled chicken that has gone cold. Disgusting. It was so bad that I didn't touch it.I ordered dumpling which were tasty but I find them overpriced.I still think this place is worth visiting but not all dishes are as good.	so i went to a wong again  do not order the 8 spices chicken  it is served at room temperature and the chicken tastes like boiled chicken that has gone cold  disgusting  it was so bad that i didn t touch it i ordered dumpling which were tasty but i find them overpriced i still think this place is worth visiting but not all dishes are as good

27	5.0	A.Wong.  A recent Michelin star and a mark of 5 in the new edition of the Good Food Guide are both to be taken seriously, and A.Wang is no disappointment.  Andrew Wang is British born of Chinese descent, and had travelled extensively in China. His 10-course tasting menu, a culinary journey through the vast county of his ancestors, is not cheap, especially in a country where cheap High St Chinese is ubiquitous but seldom good, but the quality of cooking and presentation is as far removed from the ordinary as is the £70 price tag.  It's enough to say here that no dish disappointed, most excelled, and one or two were quite stunning.  The meal takes 2.5 hours and is worth both the time and the money if you want subtly, variety and polish.  If not, your local Chinese will do you a sweet-sour pork and egg-fried rice for a fraction of the price.  But you will be much the poorer for it, at least gastronomically speaking. Highly recommended	a wong   a recent michelin star and a mark of 5 in the new edition of the good food guide are both to be taken seriously  and a wang is no disappointment   andrew wang is british born of chinese descent  and had travelled extensively in china  his 10 course tasting menu  a culinary journey through the vast county of his ancestors  is not cheap  especially in a country where cheap high st chinese is ubiquitous but seldom good  but the quality of cooking and presentation is as far removed from the ordinary as is the  70 price tag   it s enough to say here that no dish disappointed  most excelled  and one or two were quite stunning   the meal takes 2 5 hours and is worth both the time and the money if you want subtly  variety and polish   if not  your local chinese will do you a sweet sour pork and egg fried rice for a fraction of the price   but you will be much the poorer for it  at least gastronomically speaking  highly recommended

29	5.0	I'm soon leaving London after living here for over 5 years. And as every good urban explorer, I have a list of things-to-do. A visit at A. Wong had been bookmarked ever since I saw the reviews of trusted Yelpers like Rich M and Steve B. And so - with a mere two weeks to go - I had to create a carefully worked out schedule and tonight it was time for A. Wong. Blissfully disregarding the other Yelpers comments on making a reservation even for lunch time, I showed up for dinner without announcement. But it was Monday night and the restaurant was able to accommodate me immediately. In fact, it was rather quiet and so I enjoyed the attention and great hospitality of many of the waiting staff. The waitress who welcomed me, offered me a seat at a table, but spotting the stools at the bar, I asked to be sat there; I much more enjoy sitting at a bar, when it's just me. And especially in this case, I was able to get a seat with view into the open kitchen, where a small army of chefs was already handling a set of woks in a skilled manner - I love when the entire wok lights up in flames when whisked about. I asked the waiter to help me choose from the menu, which was thankfully not as jam-packed as you can typically expect from a Chinese restaurant. In fact, I loved the simplicity of it. The waiter suggested the following: dim sum basket to start with, crispy chilli-caramelised beef & slow-raised pork belly as mains. I took him up on the latter two dishes, but declined the dim sum starter. This I replaced it with strir-fried mixed vegetables. I ordered egg-fried rice on the side. My selection turned out to be excellent; I especially loved the pork belly. The sauce was so good that I used the rice to soak up every last drop of it. The caramelised beef reminded me in its preparation of the traditional crispy orange beef. Excellent as well. The veggies and the rice were lovely as well. A. Wong is not your cheap whole-in-wall Chinese restaurant. But, given the high standard of cooking and the excellent service, I find the prices to be adequate. Granted, it was twice as much as I would typically spend on a weeknight evening, but given that I was on a very special quest, I allowed for some adjustments in my budget. The interior of the restaurant is not necessarily my taste. To me, it's a bit too clean and modern. But since I've never been a man known to have a superior judgement in design, you might as well disregard my opinion here. All in all, I'm very happy to have heard about this place and managed to tick it off my list. Actually, I would even go as far and say that this has been the best Chinese food I've eaten in London.

32	4.0	A friend and I went for a casual dinner, and everything was solid for a Chinese place in a residential neighbourhood. We ordered the crispy duck with pancakes & plum sauce, chicken wings filled with prawns & black pepper sauce, dimsum basket, egg fried rice and wanton soup. Most impressive were the dimsum and the chicken wings. Both had a touch of creativity on top of solid quality. The egg fried rice was good as well. However, I was disappointed with the duck and the wanton soup -- in my view, both were a bit off from the traditional authenticity nor had proper modern creativity. Ambience was good, but it can get quite noisy, so do not come if you're looking for quiet and intimacy. Service was also reasonable -- prompt and patient as we took our time to decide what to order. Would go back for the dimsum and the chicken wings -- and maybe to try a few other dishes.	a friend and i went for a casual dinner  and everything was solid for a chinese place in a residential neighbourhood  we ordered the crispy duck with pancakes   plum sauce  chicken wings filled with prawns   black pepper sauce  dimsum basket  egg fried rice and wanton soup  most impressive were the dimsum and the chicken wings  both had a touch of creativity on top of solid quality  the egg fried rice was good as well  however  i was disappointed with the duck and the wanton soup    in my view  both were a bit off from the traditional authenticity nor had proper modern creativity  ambience was good  but it can get quite noisy  so do not come if you re looking for quiet and intimacy  service was also reasonable    prompt and patient as we took our time to decide what to order  would go back for the dimsum and the chicken wings    and maybe to try a few other dishes

35	4.0	It was unfortunate that most of the dishes (63 degree tea egg, razor clams)  I wanted to get were sold out, but the ones I received we pretty good. The dumplings and shumai were delicious, and the Pork and prawn dumpling added a chicharron crunch. The best dish was the Yunnan wild mushrooms, truffles and red date casserole. deep flavors, tasted oyster sauce and umami. Xinjiang barbecued lamb with cumin, chilli and pomegranate salad was very balanced, but i did wish the lamb was less blackend or charred, that said it's probably meant to be that way and I shouldn't complain Eggplant was spicy, flavorful and delicious, pretty oily but not greasy as if it was double fried.Tea smoked banana, nut crumble, chocolate, soy caramel had a pretty amazing table side presentation, which I won't divulge so you can experience it yourself. Record a video if you can. Dessert itself was amazingly sweet bitter, crunchy, without being too overwhelming.	it was unfortunate that most of the dishes  63 degree tea egg  razor clams   i wanted to get were sold out  but the ones i received we pretty good  the dumplings and shumai were delicious  and the pork and prawn dumpling added a chicharron crunch  the best dish was the yunnan wild mushrooms  truffles and red date casserole  deep flavors  tasted oyster sauce and umami  xinjiang barbecued lamb with cumin  chilli and pomegranate salad was very balanced  but i did wish the lamb was less blackend or charred  that said it s probably meant to be that way and i shouldn t complain eggplant was spicy  flavorful and delicious  pretty oily but not greasy as if it was double fried tea smoked banana  nut crumble  chocolate  soy caramel had a pretty amazing table side presentation  which i won t divulge so you can experience it yourself  record a video if you can  dessert itself was amazingly sweet bitter  crunchy  without being too overwhelming 
36	3.0	I tried to eat here last year, finally I made it there tonight and I'm clearly too late on the scene. Despite being the critics and bloggers darling restaurant of London over the past two years it was very disappointing. Ok only £120 for 3 people including a decent bottle of Viognier for dinner, but the standard of food was average. In fact the starters were terrible. Pickled cucumbers - not a patch on real smacked cucumbers. Sweet and sour rib - lacking in meat and a sauce that lacked any character. 63 degree tea egg - no tea flavour, no tea markings on the egg white at all (although still the best tasting snack we had). Longjing, garlic and chilli prawn - lacking in tea flavour and depth of umami. BBQ pork jerky - embarrassingly small (how can a main only cost twice as much as this slither of meat), can buy better from Taiwan. Was it an off day in the starter section? Surely it had to be with such great reviews and accolades aimed at this place. Luckily the mains were better, most were average with a few dishes like the market green vegetables, anhui fish belly, and the wagyu beef fried rice being quite good. Phew! Although to be frank not good enough to make me return.Very disappointing given the rave reviews. Of course it's better than the restaurants in Chinatown catering for tourists, but it's also obvious why there wasn't a single table of Chinese customers in a busy restaurant. Leave this one to the media worshippers who value hype and media coverage more than actual taste.  But maybe you'll think this is good Chinese food. If so, you're in luck as there's much better to come in your food adventures.PS. For heaven's sake give me proper chopsticks instead of disposable wooden ones. But maybe all the money was spent on PR and social media instead of appropriate chopsticks.	i tried to eat here last year  finally i made it there tonight and i m clearly too late on the scene  despite being the critics and bloggers darling restaurant of london over the past two years it was very disappointing  ok only  120 for 3 people including a decent bottle of viognier for dinner  but the standard of food was average  in fact the starters were terrible  pickled cucumbers   not a patch on real smacked cucumbers  sweet and sour rib   lacking in meat and a sauce that lacked any character  63 degree tea egg   no tea flavour  no tea markings on the egg white at all  although still the best tasting snack we had   longjing  garlic and chilli prawn   lacking in tea flavour and depth of umami  bbq pork jerky   embarrassingly small  how can a main only cost twice as much as this slither of meat   can buy better from taiwan  was it an off day in the starter section  surely it had to be with such great reviews and accolades aimed at this place  luckily the mains were better  most were average with a few dishes like the market green vegetables  anhui fish belly  and the wagyu beef fried rice being quite good  phew  although to be frank not good enough to make me return very disappointing given the rave reviews  of course it s better than the restaurants in chinatown catering for tourists  but it s also obvious why there wasn t a single table of chinese customers in a busy restaurant  leave this one to the media worshippers who value hype and media coverage more than actual taste   but maybe you ll think this is good chinese food  if so  you re in luck as there s much better to come in your food adventures ps  for heaven s sake give me proper chopsticks instead of disposable wooden ones  but maybe all the money was spent on pr and social media instead of appropriate chopsticks 
37	5.0	"Attire- CasualCost- Ten Course Tasting Menu 55£/per person Wine bottles 30-35£ RangeService- Attentive, Friendly, Well InformedLets just say that I learned quite a bit about Chinese history during my ten courses at A Wong. Chef and owner Andrew Wong himself personally toured much of China and its 14 national borders to craft a ten course tasting menu that built upon the diversity that makes up Chinese cuisine with respect to each region. Throughout our meal, we took a tour through the spicy peppers of Sichuan, cumin flavors of Shaanxi province, famous Xiao Long Bao of Shanghai and lemongrass from the Yunnan province. Each flavor influences by flavors from neighboring countries.We were greeted by a gregarious hostess who throughout the night we were able to see how much she enjoyed interacting with what appeared to be regular patrons. By the end of the night we knew why. We decided to go with the ten course tasting menu and started off with two glasses of very reasonable priced (9.50£) sparkling wine from England (look for our post on sparkling wines from England later). We ordered a bottle of crisp Sauvignon from Touraine France for dinner.An amuse bouche was promptly bought to the table consisting of a cold jellyfish with a tapioca rice cracker. It was accompanied by a duck sauce as well as house made pork jerky, pickles and sautéed onions.Shrimp Dumpling with citrus foam atop and pork dumpling (Dueling Dim Sum)The first course was a dueling Dim Sum with a pork dumpling and a shrimp dumpling with a citrus foam on top. This was followed by 63 degree egg. From what we learned, these tea eggs are very common in Chinese street markets so it came with an incense to mimic the smoke you might smell at a street market. The egg is poached in tea and comes served on top of shredded phyllo dough. I was amazed the the flavor of tea was appreciate even with the powerful creaminess of the yolk.The following dish was Xiao Long Bao, soup dumplings. These are very famous in Shanghai and have been super popularized by Din Tai Fung. There is an art to eating these without spilling the soup inside. sadly Tim hasn't learned.The following dishes consisted of abalone with with shiitake mushrooms, sea cucumber and abalone butter.With the following dishes, we slowly moved from the central Anhui province to the periphery of the country with the northern province of Shaanxi and southern province of Yunnan near Vietnam and Laos. From the Anhui province, we experienced red braised fermented cod fermented cold belly, with traditional Chinese vegetables on the side sautéed in bean curd and shrimp butter. This dish also came with a side dish of fermented shrimp that could be brushed on the cod belly. we were told a small amount goes a long way and they were right. If you love the tanginess of fermented foods you would love this dish.To the North, we experience Shaanxi pulled lamb ""burger"" with red onion, pomegranates, lettuce cumin seed and peanut sauce. Lamb is very big in Shaanxi province and the cumin, peanut and pomegranates is influence by the very North and West province of Xinjiang which borders Pakistan and India and has a very large Muslim population.As we travel to the South we experience Yunnan seared beef with mint, chili and lemongrass that gave the dish a berry tart and sweet flavor. This was served on top of thin noodles and truffles. Vietnam flavors very much play a part in the cuisine of Yunnan Province which it borders.Next we travel to the area of China famous for there Sichuan peppers. The next dish consisted of a Sichuanese aubergine with Gong Bao Chicken Lettuce Wrap. The pepper in the aubergine transformed your last buds from spicy last to a salty metallic taste to almost a numbing feeling that was something never experienced before. The lettuce wrap provided a nice cool and crispy balance to the spice of the aubergine. Tim was super excited to try this dish but little did he know what his taste buds were in for.The next dish was the perfect follow up to the spice of the previous dish and consisted of chili barbecued pineapple with Beijing street yogurt. The yogurt came in a simple syrup that added just the appropriate sweetness to the tartness of the yogurt.To end a fantastic tour of Cantonese Culture, we ended our meal with a blood orange meringue filled with blood orange sorbet accompanied by sugar dusted lotus. In Chinese Culture, the lotus symbolizes the ultimate purity of the heart and mind and perfection. I can honestly say that this was a meal that I won't forget quickly. The staff were amazing, the concept is ingenious and the execution with perfect. I highly recommend you visit A Wong next time you are in London.Furthermore, A Wong was recently award 3 AA Rosettes for culinary excellence."	attire  casualcost  ten course tasting menu 55  per person wine bottles 30 35  rangeservice  attentive  friendly  well informedlets just say that i learned quite a bit about chinese history during my ten courses at a wong  chef and owner andrew wong himself personally toured much of china and its 14 national borders to craft a ten course tasting menu that built upon the diversity that makes up chinese cuisine with respect to each region  throughout our meal  we took a tour through the spicy peppers of sichuan  cumin flavors of shaanxi province  famous xiao long bao of shanghai and lemongrass from the yunnan province  each flavor influences by flavors from neighboring countries we were greeted by a gregarious hostess who throughout the night we were able to see how much she enjoyed interacting with what appeared to be regular patrons  by the end of the night we knew why  we decided to go with the ten course tasting menu and started off with two glasses of very reasonable priced  9 50   sparkling wine from england  look for our post on sparkling wines from england later   we ordered a bottle of crisp sauvignon from touraine france for dinner an amuse bouche was promptly bought to the table consisting of a cold jellyfish with a tapioca rice cracker  it was accompanied by a duck sauce as well as house made pork jerky  pickles and saut ed onions shrimp dumpling with citrus foam atop and pork dumpling  dueling dim sum the first course was a dueling dim sum with a pork dumpling and a shrimp dumpling with a citrus foam on top  this was followed by 63 degree egg  from what we learned  these tea eggs are very common in chinese street markets so it came with an incense to mimic the smoke you might smell at a street market  the egg is poached in tea and comes served on top of shredded phyllo dough  i was amazed the the flavor of tea was appreciate even with the powerful creaminess of the yolk the following dish was xiao long bao  soup dumplings  these are very famous in shanghai and have been super popularized by din tai fung  there is an art to eating these without spilling the soup inside  sadly tim hasn t learned the following dishes consisted of abalone with with shiitake mushrooms  sea cucumber and abalone butter with the following dishes  we slowly moved from the central anhui province to the periphery of the country with the northern province of shaanxi and southern province of yunnan near vietnam and laos  from the anhui province  we experienced red braised fermented cod fermented cold belly  with traditional chinese vegetables on the side saut ed in bean curd and shrimp butter  this dish also came with a side dish of fermented shrimp that could be brushed on the cod belly  we were told a small amount goes a long way and they were right  if you love the tanginess of fermented foods you would love this dish to the north  we experience shaanxi pulled lamb  burger  with red onion  pomegranates  lettuce cumin seed and peanut sauce  lamb is very big in shaanxi province and the cumin  peanut and pomegranates is influence by the very north and west province of xinjiang which borders pakistan and india and has a very large muslim population as we travel to the south we experience yunnan seared beef with mint  chili and lemongrass that gave the dish a berry tart and sweet flavor  this was served on top of thin noodles and truffles  vietnam flavors very much play a part in the cuisine of yunnan province which it borders next we travel to the area of china famous for there sichuan peppers  the next dish consisted of a sichuanese aubergine with gong bao chicken lettuce wrap  the pepper in the aubergine transformed your last buds from spicy last to a salty metallic taste to almost a numbing feeling that was something never experienced before  the lettuce wrap provided a nice cool and crispy balance to the spice of the aubergine  tim was super excited to try this dish but little did he know what his taste buds were in for the next dish was the perfect follow up to the spice of the previous dish and consisted of chili barbecued pineapple with beijing street yogurt  the yogurt came in a simple syrup that added just the appropriate sweetness to the tartness of the yogurt to end a fantastic tour of cantonese culture  we ended our meal with a blood orange meringue filled with blood orange sorbet accompanied by sugar dusted lotus  in chinese culture  the lotus symbolizes the ultimate purity of the heart and mind and perfection  i can honestly say that this was a meal that i won t forget quickly  the staff were amazing  the concept is ingenious and the execution with perfect  i highly recommend you visit a wong next time you are in london furthermore  a wong was recently award 3 aa rosettes for culinary excellence

In short. Well executed Chinese presented with style. Nice for a date assuming you are upstairs. However it is pricey at £42/person with just 2 glasses of wine.	the shredded duck is a great dish and the dim sum is small but delicious  the wing stuffed prawns is interesting but not worth it  the tea egg is better and stylish but nothing amazing  in short  well executed chinese presented with style  nice for a date assuming you are upstairs  however it is pricey at  42 person with just 2 glasses of wine 
39	5.0	Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed some of the best Chinese food I've had.You may need a reservation, even for lunch. We didn't have one but luckily there were some spaces at the counter. A simple but comfortable layout inside leaning to the clinical rather than sumptuous but most importantly, the food is super good.The open kitchen is in full view of diligent chefs with precision focus, carefully carving up choice pieces of Peking duck and using temperature probes to ensure perfection. Not your standard Chinese.The prawn cracker really is the best ever. A single, huge thing forming a nest for some crispy seaweed and various micro dice pickles and full of flavour. Dim sum are served as single pieces. A mini shanghai dumpling with vinegary soup inside, a quail egg croquette puff with foam top, scallop puff with XO sauce appeared like a mini flower encased in an orange crisp puff pastry (but wasn't the best overall of the selection) and a deep fried prawn  ball with abalone and chilli vinaigrette which was the highlight for me. Together with a very good spring roll and some Singapore noodles, this was quite a treat. The presentation was tops and the flavours and textures were quite special.There are standard dishes as well as dim sum available. I'd love to return for the chef's tasting menu.The staff were friendly and prompt and the bill wasn't as much as we we were expecting so overall top rating for me.	stopped here for lunch and enjoyed some of the best chinese food i ve had you may need a reservation  even for lunch  we didn t have one but luckily there were some spaces at the counter  a simple but comfortable layout inside leaning to the clinical rather than sumptuous but most importantly  the food is super good the open kitchen is in full view of diligent chefs with precision focus  carefully carving up choice pieces of peking duck and using temperature probes to ensure perfection  not your standard chinese the prawn cracker really is the best ever  a single  huge thing forming a nest for some crispy seaweed and various micro dice pickles and full of flavour  dim sum are served as single pieces  a mini shanghai dumpling with vinegary soup inside  a quail egg croquette puff with foam top  scallop puff with xo sauce appeared like a mini flower encased in an orange crisp puff pastry  but wasn t the best overall of the selection  and a deep fried prawn  ball with abalone and chilli vinaigrette which was the highlight for me  together with a very good spring roll and some singapore noodles  this was quite a treat  the presentation was tops and the flavours and textures were quite special there are standard dishes as well as dim sum available  i d love to return for the chef s tasting menu the staff were friendly and prompt and the bill wasn t as much as we we were expecting so overall top rating for me

42	3.0	Slick modern Chinese food - very close to the bustling and not very glam transport hub that is Victoria, train, underground and bus stations. Wilton Road has a great mixture of different eateries and this is a place to treat yourself with something different. Not many tables - so book ahead for groups of more than 2 I would say. Only seating that was available on my visit were the high chairs at the bar - which I would normally not be keen on for comfort and space - but they were better than expected. They do a set menu for lunch which won't leave you stuffed but is a really nice showcase of the interesting flavour combinations and textures that the menu has. Delicious dim sum that I could have eaten many many more and delicious flat noodles that, surprise surprise, I could have had double of. Very intrigued by their peking duck feast which requires 48 hour notice before ordering and is described as an 8 course banquet.	slick modern chinese food   very close to the bustling and not very glam transport hub that is victoria  train  underground and bus stations  wilton road has a great mixture of different eateries and this is a place to treat yourself with something different  not many tables   so book ahead for groups of more than 2 i would say  only seating that was available on my visit were the high chairs at the bar   which i would normally not be keen on for comfort and space   but they were better than expected  they do a set menu for lunch which won t leave you stuffed but is a really nice showcase of the interesting flavour combinations and textures that the menu has  delicious dim sum that i could have eaten many many more and delicious flat noodles that  surprise surprise  i could have had double of  very intrigued by their peking duck feast which requires 48 hour notice before ordering and is described as an 8 course banquet

The quality and freshness of the ingredients were always highlighted.

45	5.0	Let me start by saying I almost took off one star because this restaurant is in London and thus not a place I can regularly visit, but that wouldn't be very nice of me - so I didn't :)I visited A. Wong while in town for the weekend to see a friend. A. Wong is the type of place I would LOVE to have in Chicago for a sophisticated, delicious dim sum outing.We ordered a pretty long list of items between the two of us... Some highlights included the sweet & sour rib (I ordered a second round - perfect sauce, tender meat, not too fatty), sugar coated pork bun (second favorite - amazing sauce on the pork inside, and the sugar is just right on the outside), the buttered shredded chicken was outstanding. The tea egg was interesting, but not sure it was worth the price.The tiger prawn was simply, but perfectly seasoned - but at 3 pounds for 1 prawn it wasn't worth it.Between us I think we ordered 17 or 18 dim sum/dishes plus 2 glasses of wine and 2 espressos - bill for lunch was 80 pounds. Totally worth it if you're looking for something special and delicious.Service was the primary soft spot. Our server seemed slightly clueless - but we had just 1 minor error, so things worked out fine.	let me start by saying i almost took off one star because this restaurant is in london and thus not a place i can regularly visit  but that wouldn t be very nice of me   so i didn t   i visited a  wong while in town for the weekend to see a friend  a  wong is the type of place i would love to have in chicago for a sophisticated  delicious dim sum outing we ordered a pretty long list of items between the two of us    some highlights included the sweet   sour rib  i ordered a second round   perfect sauce  tender meat  not too fatty   sugar coated pork bun  second favorite   amazing sauce on the pork inside  and the sugar is just right on the outside   the buttered shredded chicken was outstanding  the tea egg was interesting  but not sure it was worth the price the tiger prawn was simply  but perfectly seasoned   but at 3 pounds for 1 prawn it wasn t worth it between us i think we ordered 17 or 18 dim sum dishes plus 2 glasses of wine and 2 espressos   bill for lunch was 80 pounds  totally worth it if you re looking for something special and delicious service was the primary soft spot  our server seemed slightly clueless   but we had just 1 minor error  so things worked out fine 
46	1.0	Service always has been one of the, if not the most important elements to the overall dining experience, it doesn't matter how good the food is, if the waiters were being stuffy, uninterested or rude, I would just not go back. Some restaurants, would as far as state that to have a successful run restaurant business, 70% is down to the service alone. The overall service level in London has always been of a high standard, I don't ever recall encountering a restaurant with outrageous and disgraceful service but there is always a first time right? Absolutely, and the award goes to A Wong, a Chinese restaurant in Victoria, London.After placing our orders, we waited for over 30 minute and still no sign of our food, and when I checked with the waiter, he checked for us but never returned to explain what was happening, another 10 minutes gone and the food finally arrived, so it seems like he had forgotten our orders  but not willing to admit it at the same time. We ate in frustration while through the whole dinner, not one single waiter bothered to approach to check on us, never once did they help us with topping our wine and tea, all the staff treated us like 3rd class citizens and showed no interest whatsoever.The food was over priced, all the dishes were tapa sizes and only enough for one person, the fried beef noodles was 50% more expensive than most restaurants in China Town but 50% smaller in portion at the same time, and frankly enough, quality wise it wasn't much different. What can I say? It was the most painful dining out experience I've ever encountered, the staff were rude and unfriendly to say the least, the joke was when I asked for the service charge to be removed from the bill, the waiter didn't even bother to asked what was the problem which pretty much summed up their unprofessional manner and attitude.	service always has been one of the  if not the most important elements to the overall dining experience  it doesn t matter how good the food is  if the waiters were being stuffy  uninterested or rude  i would just not go back  some restaurants  would as far as state that to have a successful run restaurant business  70  is down to the service alone  the overall service level in london has always been of a high standard  i don t ever recall encountering a restaurant with outrageous and disgraceful service but there is always a first time right  absolutely  and the award goes to a wong  a chinese restaurant in victoria  london after placing our orders  we waited for over 30 minute and still no sign of our food  and when i checked with the waiter  he checked for us but never returned to explain what was happening  another 10 minutes gone and the food finally arrived  so it seems like he had forgotten our orders  but not willing to admit it at the same time  we ate in frustration while through the whole dinner  not one single waiter bothered to approach to check on us  never once did they help us with topping our wine and tea  all the staff treated us like 3rd class citizens and showed no interest whatsoever the food was over priced  all the dishes were tapa sizes and only enough for one person  the fried beef noodles was 50  more expensive than most restaurants in china town but 50  smaller in portion at the same time  and frankly enough  quality wise it wasn t much different  what can i say  it was the most painful dining out experience i ve ever encountered  the staff were rude and unfriendly to say the least  the joke was when i asked for the service charge to be removed from the bill  the waiter didn t even bother to asked what was the problem which pretty much summed up their unprofessional manner and attitude

48	4.0	The feng shui inside might be stunning but it's difficult to imagine many less auspicious locations in zone 1. A Wong sits like a slightly out of place squat granite and glass monolith among the mediocre lunchtime options and sandwich chains of Wilton Road. Laid back decor inside, a clean mix of Scandinavian woodwork and soft straight stone lines. There are three menus, a lighter dim sum focussed lunch menu, a more substantial evening list and a tasting menu spanning the both. They all dip in and out of a range of regional specialisms, so Sichuan standards like Gong Bao chicken and dry fried beans rub noses with braised lettuce, Imperial dishes and Yangzhou fried rice.Prices are reasonable across the board, though at £1.50 a piece the dim sum will mount up pretty quickly. It isn't the place for a weekend blow out, but then you're unlikely to see many people round here during the weekend other than the confused tourists disembarking from Victoria station. Of particular note is the express menu, with two courses, a drink (and two lovely salted caramel petits fours) for a very reasonable £12.95. A trio of dim sum wouldn't usually come close to satisfying me, even as a starter, but these are monsters. That classic shrimp har gau, here at least half again as big as the tiddlers I'm used to in Chinatown, came with an innovative twist, a protective bubble coat of sharp citrus and yuzu foam. That other stalwart pork and prawn siu mai came with its own welcome innovation, a tiny sliver of puffed pork crackling, texturally complimenting the freshly steamed and freshly made parcel. A grease free and delightfully crispy pork wonton completed the set, as delightful a dim sum experience as I've had in this country. Of the four or so mains offered with the express menu, I went for Sichuanese speciality dan dan mian, or peddler's noodles, named after the distinctive cooking pots they were served from by wandering street sellers. Whenever I've had it before, the soft minced beef, seasoned with those numbing Sichuan peppercorns, mixed with chunks of chilli, veggies and noodles has come in a spicy broth made of noodle water, Shaoshing rice wine and stock. Here it comes, with a few beansprouts and a single vegetable, in a thick meaty gravy, dumped over pedestrian noodles. Not unpleasant per se, but unexpectedly dry, overly rich and not much to my taste. I'll be back, if not for the tasting menu, certainly for a more detailed examination of the evening menu and some more of that super sized dim sum. The sun was out, and the open plan airy space will be gorgeous come the summer. Let's hope that the locals can tear themselves away from Nando's and the infinitely inferior Dim T just up the road and support the new kid on the block.	the feng shui inside might be stunning but it s difficult to imagine many less auspicious locations in zone 1  a wong sits like a slightly out of place squat granite and glass monolith among the mediocre lunchtime options and sandwich chains of wilton road  laid back decor inside  a clean mix of scandinavian woodwork and soft straight stone lines  there are three menus  a lighter dim sum focussed lunch menu  a more substantial evening list and a tasting menu spanning the both  they all dip in and out of a range of regional specialisms  so sichuan standards like gong bao chicken and dry fried beans rub noses with braised lettuce  imperial dishes and yangzhou fried rice prices are reasonable across the board  though at  1 50 a piece the dim sum will mount up pretty quickly  it isn t the place for a weekend blow out  but then you re unlikely to see many people round here during the weekend other than the confused tourists disembarking from victoria station  of particular note is the express menu  with two courses  a drink  and two lovely salted caramel petits fours  for a very reasonable  12 95  a trio of dim sum wouldn t usually come close to satisfying me  even as a starter  but these are monsters  that classic shrimp har gau  here at least half again as big as the tiddlers i m used to in chinatown  came with an innovative twist  a protective bubble coat of sharp citrus and yuzu foam  that other stalwart pork and prawn siu mai came with its own welcome innovation  a tiny sliver of puffed pork crackling  texturally complimenting the freshly steamed and freshly made parcel  a grease free and delightfully crispy pork wonton completed the set  as delightful a dim sum experience as i ve had in this country  of the four or so mains offered with the express menu  i went for sichuanese speciality dan dan mian  or peddler s noodles  named after the distinctive cooking pots they were served from by wandering street sellers  whenever i ve had it before  the soft minced beef  seasoned with those numbing sichuan peppercorns  mixed with chunks of chilli  veggies and noodles has come in a spicy broth made of noodle water  shaoshing rice wine and stock  here it comes  with a few beansprouts and a single vegetable  in a thick meaty gravy  dumped over pedestrian noodles  not unpleasant per se  but unexpectedly dry  overly rich and not much to my taste  i ll be back  if not for the tasting menu  certainly for a more detailed examination of the evening menu and some more of that super sized dim sum  the sun was out  and the open plan airy space will be gorgeous come the summer  let s hope that the locals can tear themselves away from nando s and the infinitely inferior dim t just up the road and support the new kid on the block 
49	1.0	Average food, but shockingly poor service. I went with my wife and cousin last week. After waiting for 20 minutes trying to catch the waiter's eye, we finally ordered. But worse still, the food arrived cold, and when we pointed this out to the waiter, he refused to take it back to the kitchen, and made the excuse that it shouldn't be too hot to eat! We managed to get the food reheated by speaking to a different member of staff. Food was a let down - we were excited by the good reviews here on Yelp but the flavours were dull, and my wife's lamb burger was overcooked. Very disappointed.	average food  but shockingly poor service  i went with my wife and cousin last week  after waiting for 20 minutes trying to catch the waiter s eye  we finally ordered  but worse still  the food arrived cold  and when we pointed this out to the waiter  he refused to take it back to the kitchen  and made the excuse that it shouldn t be too hot to eat  we managed to get the food reheated by speaking to a different member of staff  food was a let down   we were excited by the good reviews here on yelp but the flavours were dull  and my wife s lamb burger was overcooked  very disappointed

51	1.0	"We had looked forward to trying A Wong after reading good reviews about the deliciously unique dim sum. The taste and presentation of the food did not disappoint, although be prepared for an expensive version of dim sum with very small portions. One piece really means one small piece. Unfortunately, the service was on the complete opposite side of the spectrum and it was the worst service in London that I can remember. We were enjoying our food but one friend had not received anything she ordered, so we kindly asked the servers about the missing items. We were told quite rudely that we had received everything we had ordered before they had actually even checked that we had. We again stated that we had not received everything we ordered (we would know better I would think if one person had not received any of her food), and after some arguing we asked to speak to the manager. The manager turned out to be the woman who had taken our order. Without hesitation she also insisted we had not ordered what we said we had ordered. Even when we listed the specific items we were missing, she insisted loudly and very rudely that we had never ordered those items. I suggested that she could check her notepad where she had written the items down, and when she did so she realised that indeed she had forgotten to place the items on the back side of the page into our order. Instead of apologising, she just muttered ""I guess it was my fault"". Unbelievably bad behaviour in any restaurant, but especially when one tries to charge several pounds for each piece of dim sum. When she continued to argue about the missing order while telling us she did not have an attitude problem, we asked to speak to the owner to complain. This did no good at all because the manager is the wife of the owner, and he said that she is in charge of the customers. It made me think of the advice never to work with close family.... We will never go back and even though I'm usually too busy to bother writing reviews, this service was so appalling I felt it my duty to give a review of the restaurant and recommend that others AVOID it! There are so many other great places to try in London with owners who actually appreciate their customers. And I have some constructive suggestions for the restaurant if they are unable to employ a suitable manager with customer service skills- maybe they should number the menu and let people write down their own orders like other dim sum restaurants. At least then the customer might actually get what they ordered and limit their interaction with the disrespectful and rude staff."	we had looked forward to trying a wong after reading good reviews about the deliciously unique dim sum  the taste and presentation of the food did not disappoint  although be prepared for an expensive version of dim sum with very small portions  one piece really means one small piece  unfortunately  the service was on the complete opposite side of the spectrum and it was the worst service in london that i can remember  we were enjoying our food but one friend had not received anything she ordered  so we kindly asked the servers about the missing items  we were told quite rudely that we had received everything we had ordered before they had actually even checked that we had  we again stated that we had not received everything we ordered  we would know better i would think if one person had not received any of her food   and after some arguing we asked to speak to the manager  the manager turned out to be the woman who had taken our order  without hesitation she also insisted we had not ordered what we said we had ordered  even when we listed the specific items we were missing  she insisted loudly and very rudely that we had never ordered those items  i suggested that she could check her notepad where she had written the items down  and when she did so she realised that indeed she had forgotten to place the items on the back side of the page into our order  instead of apologising  she just muttered  i guess it was my fault   unbelievably bad behaviour in any restaurant  but especially when one tries to charge several pounds for each piece of dim sum  when she continued to argue about the missing order while telling us she did not have an attitude problem  we asked to speak to the owner to complain  this did no good at all because the manager is the wife of the owner  and he said that she is in charge of the customers  it made me think of the advice never to work with close family     we will never go back and even though i m usually too busy to bother writing reviews  this service was so appalling i felt it my duty to give a review of the restaurant and recommend that others avoid it  there are so many other great places to try in london with owners who actually appreciate their customers  and i have some constructive suggestions for the restaurant if they are unable to employ a suitable manager with customer service skills  maybe they should number the menu and let people write down their own orders like other dim sum restaurants  at least then the customer might actually get what they ordered and limit their interaction with the disrespectful and rude staff

Tried the Shanghai steamed dumplings, pork and prawn dumpling (a favourite), clear shrimp dumpling, quail egg croquette puff (pretty special), baked roasted pork buns (THE favourite), sesame buttered smoked chicken (was really nice but probably wouldn't order again because the other stuff was even better), pot sticker, mushroom, pork and truffle dumpling, taro cake (really good), wonton with garlic, chilli oil and crispy bean curd, scallop puff with XO sauce (really good), sweet and sour rib and fried cheese. So we kind of worked our way through the menu.

I'm always grateful my ex was an investment banker when we go out here - we can easily spend £100 in a meal on some of the best chinese food in London. This is your destination chinese restaurant - inobtrusive service, excellent food, pleasant ambiance, and complete with a division bell for the MPs who dine here to get back to vote.If you're here, you might get to see some of the political classes out for a meal, catch sight of the odd journalist, or just the wealthy locals. It caters well for vegetarians, pescatarians and bona fide carnivores, with food that makes the mouth water.Well recommended.	this restaurant is not cheap  but it is addictive  i m always grateful my ex was an investment banker when we go out here   we can easily spend  100 in a meal on some of the best chinese food in london  this is your destination chinese restaurant   inobtrusive service  excellent food  pleasant ambiance  and complete with a division bell for the mps who dine here to get back to vote if you re here  you might get to see some of the political classes out for a meal  catch sight of the odd journalist  or just the wealthy locals  it caters well for vegetarians  pescatarians and bona fide carnivores  with food that makes the mouth water well recommended

56	3.0	Update: 15.02.2012 A rather less good experience the other night: I went with a friend and her daughter. They didn't want rice with the meal, but instead ordered another main dish, and we were in a hurry. The waitress informed us rather gracelessly that we had to order at least £10 of food per head after 19:00. We were unaware of this (we didn't see it on the menu) and ordered some spring rolls as well. The restaurant was almost empty, so we weren't denying anyone else a table. The food was absolutely fine, but when we came to pay the bill came to nearly £40 anyway, so we need not have ordered the spring rolls. It included 12.5% service charge but the credit card machine asked me if I wanted to add a tip, which is a practice I find really unpleasant; anyone not paying attention could easily pay the service charge twice. A real pity, as I liked the place before, so it has dropped a couple of stars.-Five minutes' walk from Victoria station, Kym's is a cut above your average Chinese restaurant and, although a little more expensive, in my view is well worth it. The menu is wide-ranging, featuring mainly Cantonese and Pekinese cuisine. An added bonus is the extensive vegetarian menu: this includes 'vegetarian meat' dishes, where vegetable ingredients are used to mimic the taste and textures of meat dishes. These include sweet and sour vegetarian chicken, sizzling vegetarian beef and vegetarian prawns! More traditional vegetarian dishes are available if that seems a little like missing the point. The wine list is also extensive for a Chinese restaurant, with good house wines (French Vin de Pays) from £12.50, ranging up to £50 a bottle if you are feeling flush. Expect a two-course meal with wine, coffee and service to cost about £25-£30 a head. In my experience the service has always been very good  friendly, attentive and helpful. The only downside is that the outdoor seating area at the front is on rather a busy road, but in the summer Kym's is blessed with excellent air-conditioning.	update  15 02 2012 a rather less good experience the other night  i went with a friend and her daughter  they didn t want rice with the meal  but instead ordered another main dish  and we were in a hurry  the waitress informed us rather gracelessly that we had to order at least  10 of food per head after 19 00  we were unaware of this  we didn t see it on the menu  and ordered some spring rolls as well  the restaurant was almost empty  so we weren t denying anyone else a table  the food was absolutely fine  but when we came to pay the bill came to nearly  40 anyway  so we need not have ordered the spring rolls  it included 12 5  service charge but the credit card machine asked me if i wanted to add a tip  which is a practice i find really unpleasant  anyone not paying attention could easily pay the service charge twice  a real pity  as i liked the place before  so it has dropped a couple of stars  five minutes  walk from victoria station  kym s is a cut above your average chinese restaurant and  although a little more expensive  in my view is well worth it  the menu is wide ranging  featuring mainly cantonese and pekinese cuisine  an added bonus is the extensive vegetarian menu  this includes  vegetarian meat  dishes  where vegetable ingredients are used to mimic the taste and textures of meat dishes  these include sweet and sour vegetarian chicken  sizzling vegetarian beef and vegetarian prawns  more traditional vegetarian dishes are available if that seems a little like missing the point  the wine list is also extensive for a chinese restaurant  with good house wines  french vin de pays  from  12 50  ranging up to  50 a bottle if you are feeling flush  expect a two course meal with wine  coffee and service to cost about  25  30 a head  in my experience the service has always been very good  friendly  attentive and helpful  the only downside is that the outdoor seating area at the front is on rather a busy road  but in the summer kym s is blessed with excellent air conditioning 
57	2.0	A. Wong is a spartan yet warm Cantonese restaurant located on Wilton Road, near Victoria station.  Despite its modern appearance and accessible open kitchen, A. Wong falls flat when it comes to food.  I only went for lunch, so I cannot comment on the dinner options.  The shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao) were flavorless - the chef seemed to use a very lean meat, which rendered the dish without any fat.  This might be healthy, but it is not enjoyable.  A Wong's take on the shrimp dumpling is interesting - the skin was thicker than most dim sum shrimp dumplings but the shrimp was of a higher quality - however, they sprayed the shrimp dumplings in some sort of foam.  Not sure I like it, but maybe I do.  Need to think more about it.  The yangzhou fried rice was executed well.  The fried rice was a good value at 7 GBP, but the other items were expensive for what they were.  Finally, there was one waiter but about 7 chefs - the service was fine but very slow.	a  wong is a spartan yet warm cantonese restaurant located on wilton road  near victoria station   despite its modern appearance and accessible open kitchen  a  wong falls flat when it comes to food   i only went for lunch  so i cannot comment on the dinner options   the shanghai dumplings  xiao long bao  were flavorless   the chef seemed to use a very lean meat  which rendered the dish without any fat   this might be healthy  but it is not enjoyable   a wong s take on the shrimp dumpling is interesting   the skin was thicker than most dim sum shrimp dumplings but the shrimp was of a higher quality   however  they sprayed the shrimp dumplings in some sort of foam   not sure i like it  but maybe i do   need to think more about it   the yangzhou fried rice was executed well   the fried rice was a good value at 7 gbp  but the other items were expensive for what they were   finally  there was one waiter but about 7 chefs   the service was fine but very slow

The food is spectacular. I came in with some skepticism thinking that it's probably slightly overhyped, but after spending several hours (and the tasting menu can take 2-3 hours easy) I can honestly say, this was one of the best culinary experience I've ever had. The best part, for me, was that every new dish was even better than the previous one, and that was already a very high bar. See my photos for what you might expect (some of the courses are missing as we were too excited to try them before taking a picture), but I'd like to add a few words on the service, as I believe that was even more spectacular than the food. Everything is done with precision and care. Everything is part of a bigger experience and not just ""dish one, dish two, dish three."" Big thank you to Ali, the restaurant manager - He made us feel welcome, comfortable, and we had a great conversation even though the place was packed and he was running around, making sure everything works as it should.

59	3.0	"Excellent service but unimaginative foodMy husband and I dined here on October 11, 2018. We had a late reservation at 9:45PM as we had just flown in that day and were trying to acclimate to the time difference.Restaurant Gordon Ramsey is on a quaint little street with an unassuming door that you might mistake for a townhouse.The space itself is nice but it is small and the ceiling and large scale chandeliers make the space feel even smaller. A nice place for a ""cozy"" date but no where near close to opulent. Maybe a nice place for a job promotion dinner but not an anniversary.I want to note that the service here is excellent - no faults here. The service is 5 out of 5 stars. Everyone was very gracious and friendly. I think at the time I thought it was hard to flag someone down to leave but I think in retrospect it was just tiredness on our part and it being quiet late.Unfortunately, personally the food did not live up to our expectations. My husband and I did not think that the food was bad; in fact the food was quite good. However, the food was in our eyes unimaginative. While the food looked stunning, almost every single dish we had (aside from the dessert courses), reminded us of dishes we had had at other establishments (Lazy Bear, Atelier Crenn, & Saison) which we enjoyed more in San Francisco. We were expecting to be blown away and that unfortunately was not the case. For the price, the meal we received was fair. Excellent service and good food. However, the level of food is not what we are used to at 3 or even 2 Michelin star restaurants. My husband and I were hoping that a 3 Michelin Star restaurant in London would be a steal at the price the tasting menu was but it was half the price of the bay area and not half as good. We went to Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester two nights later and feel similarly that the restaurants in London are a bit subpar (though the reasoning for their ""score"" was different).Desserts here were delightful though.x-posted on TripAdvisor"	excellent service but unimaginative foodmy husband and i dined here on october 11  2018  we had a late reservation at 9 45pm as we had just flown in that day and were trying to acclimate to the time difference restaurant gordon ramsey is on a quaint little street with an unassuming door that you might mistake for a townhouse the space itself is nice but it is small and the ceiling and large scale chandeliers make the space feel even smaller  a nice place for a  cozy  date but no where near close to opulent  maybe a nice place for a job promotion dinner but not an anniversary i want to note that the service here is excellent   no faults here  the service is 5 out of 5 stars  everyone was very gracious and friendly  i think at the time i thought it was hard to flag someone down to leave but i think in retrospect it was just tiredness on our part and it being quiet late unfortunately  personally the food did not live up to our expectations  my husband and i did not think that the food was bad  in fact the food was quite good  however  the food was in our eyes unimaginative  while the food looked stunning  almost every single dish we had  aside from the dessert courses   reminded us of dishes we had had at other establishments  lazy bear  atelier crenn    saison  which we enjoyed more in san francisco  we were expecting to be blown away and that unfortunately was not the case  for the price  the meal we received was fair  excellent service and good food  however  the level of food is not what we are used to at 3 or even 2 michelin star restaurants  my husband and i were hoping that a 3 michelin star restaurant in london would be a steal at the price the tasting menu was but it was half the price of the bay area and not half as good  we went to alain ducasse at the dorchester two nights later and feel similarly that the restaurants in london are a bit subpar  though the reasoning for their  score  was different  desserts here were delightful though x posted on tripadvisor
60	5.0	Not gonna lie. I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie and the only thing I wanted to accomplish during my London layover was to check off this box. ATMOSPHERE:Intimate, minimalist, no music, no wall decor - aka the 3-Star Michelin formula to make you pay attention to the food and service.SERVICE:Flawless - inconspicuous, fluid, comfortable. The manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging. We had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly. The only bummer was that we were the last table before closing, so we didn't get a kitchen tour, which is fine because the last time I had a tour that late, all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef.FOOD:The two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared - the only thing better than having one Gordon Ramsay meal is having two! Only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird, everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates. Most of the food wasn't knock-my-socks-off-keel-over-delicious, but solid. To me, I'm pretty happy with a meal if I can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that I will remember it - for us it was the foie gras terrine, absolutely the best terrine I've every had. The sorbets were also killer.DAMAGE:2 tasting menus + 1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be ~ $700 USD. Considering that the average bill in a 3-Star US Michelin for one person is often more that that, we can't complain.Overall, an exemplary 3-Star, worth a visit when in London. I will continue to binge-watch Masterchef when the next season comes out.	not gonna lie  i m a gordon ramsay groupie and the only thing i wanted to accomplish during my london layover was to check off this box  atmosphere intimate  minimalist  no music  no wall decor   aka the 3 star michelin formula to make you pay attention to the food and service service flawless   inconspicuous  fluid  comfortable  the manager and sommelier made frequent rounds and were very engaging  we had a very annoying dietary restriction that they accommodated beautifully on the fly  the only bummer was that we were the last table before closing  so we didn t get a kitchen tour  which is fine because the last time i had a tour that late  all you could see was a sparkling clean kitchen and a lonely pastry chef food the two of us each took one of the tasting menus and shared   the only thing better than having one gordon ramsay meal is having two  only one suckling pig course was overworked and weird  everything else was tasty and we cleaned the plates  most of the food wasn t knock my socks off keel over delicious  but solid  to me  i m pretty happy with a meal if i can walk away feeling like one thing was exceptional enough that i will remember it   for us it was the foie gras terrine  absolutely the best terrine i ve every had  the sorbets were also killer damage 2 tasting menus   1 wine pairing with gratuity automatically added came out to be    700 usd  considering that the average bill in a 3 star us michelin for one person is often more that that  we can t complain overall  an exemplary 3 star  worth a visit when in london  i will continue to binge watch masterchef when the next season comes out

64	5.0	****1000th Review****This was my first Three Michelin star restaurant I have dined at and it did not disappoint. This small, intimate restaurant lives up to the hype and will be one of the best experiences you will have. For the price, I believe it is very reasonable for what they charge. Tasting menu with a high profile celebrity chef could easily cost way more than that price they charge.I suggest planning ahead on this one, it's a very small restaurant with a paced tasting menu. This isn't a place where you will walk up and get a seat. Plan ahead! The experience is awesome and I highly recommend trying to get a table here. The service is excellent and flow of the menu is just right. One piece of advice is to ask for the check, from what I was told USA vs Europe has different etiquette surrounding the check delivery. If you don't ask for it, you may sit awkwardly for a bit.The food is amazing, this was the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything start to finish was delicious and perfect. They cook at such a high level here, every dish on the menu is something I would order again. The food was so well prepared and lived up to the Michelin accolade, can't get much better than what they offer. I would go back here the first chance I got, wish this one was closer to me. This is my #1 meal and I encourage you to try them out!	    1000th review    this was my first three michelin star restaurant i have dined at and it did not disappoint  this small  intimate restaurant lives up to the hype and will be one of the best experiences you will have  for the price  i believe it is very reasonable for what they charge  tasting menu with a high profile celebrity chef could easily cost way more than that price they charge i suggest planning ahead on this one  it s a very small restaurant with a paced tasting menu  this isn t a place where you will walk up and get a seat  plan ahead  the experience is awesome and i highly recommend trying to get a table here  the service is excellent and flow of the menu is just right  one piece of advice is to ask for the check  from what i was told usa vs europe has different etiquette surrounding the check delivery  if you don t ask for it  you may sit awkwardly for a bit the food is amazing  this was the best restaurant i have ever eaten at  everything start to finish was delicious and perfect  they cook at such a high level here  every dish on the menu is something i would order again  the food was so well prepared and lived up to the michelin accolade  can t get much better than what they offer  i would go back here the first chance i got  wish this one was closer to me  this is my  1 meal and i encourage you to try them out 
65	5.0	3 Michelin Star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Definitely must try! You will need to make a reservation well in advance and it is a bit pricey - we had the Seasonal Inspirational Menu at £185 per person (USD $240). Everything was delicious and beautifully plated. The Maitre d' was very friendly and even offered us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our dinner.	3 michelin star gordon ramsay restaurant  definitely must try  you will need to make a reservation well in advance and it is a bit pricey   we had the seasonal inspirational menu at  185 per person  usd  240   everything was delicious and beautifully plated  the maitre d  was very friendly and even offered us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our dinner

It was NOT incredibly expensive as 3 Michelin star restaurant (compared with Paris).  We ordered tasting menu and dishes were phenomenal!  Pressed foie gras - It's light but tastyLobster Ravioli - It's so deliciousPoached Halibut - presented beautifully but halibut taste a bit raw...Lamb in 3 ways (Braised, confit and roasted) - it's cooked perfect on each way.Roast Pigeon - I would say Chinese Roast Pigeon a bit better.. LOLSoup **So different and special** - Pineapple coconut, it liked a drink than a soup to us. Taste so fresh and good.Sorbet - English breakfast tea with mint.  We needed grind the mint by ourselves and put the sorbet into stone mortar and pestle. White chocolate covered strawberry sorbet balls - That's so cool with dry ice presentationLemon Parfait - I personally don't like sheep milk and didn't expect bergamot would taste so good with lemon parfait.After big meal, the manger chatted and  offered us to visit the kitchen.  It's pretty impressed for medium size kitchen and staffs can make such quality of dishes.	i planned for my europe trip few months in advance and booked gordon ramsay restaurant to celebrate for my hubby s birthday dinner i have been to a few 3 michelin star and 2 michelin star restaurants in tokyo  hk  nyc   vegas   of coz  i would expect more at one of 3 michelin star restaurant in london  it was not incredibly expensive as 3 michelin star restaurant  compared with paris    we ordered tasting menu and dishes were phenomenal   pressed foie gras   it s light but tastylobster ravioli   it s so deliciouspoached halibut   presented beautifully but halibut taste a bit raw   lamb in 3 ways  braised  confit and roasted    it s cooked perfect on each way roast pigeon   i would say chinese roast pigeon a bit better   lolsoup   so different and special     pineapple coconut  it liked a drink than a soup to us  taste so fresh and good sorbet   english breakfast tea with mint   we needed grind the mint by ourselves and put the sorbet into stone mortar and pestle  white chocolate covered strawberry sorbet balls   that s so cool with dry ice presentationlemon parfait   i personally don t like sheep milk and didn t expect bergamot would taste so good with lemon parfait after big meal  the manger chatted and  offered us to visit the kitchen   it s pretty impressed for medium size kitchen and staffs can make such quality of dishes 
67	4.0	I ordered the £145 prestige tasting menu at Restaurant Gordon Ramsey, and while most courses tasted good, none were quite mind-blowing. It's usually the other way around, but I actually thought the entrees were significantly better than the appetizers or desserts. In particular, the lamb was delicious but the ravioli and lemonade parfait were ordinary. I was hoping that this restaurant would top my list of favorite Michelin experiences in London, but unfortunately that didn't happen. Oh also, what's up with the co-ed bathroom?// Peas, radish, mint, onion, goat's cheese*// Pressed foie gras - green apples, turnips, watercress, smoked duck// Ravioli - lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxtails and wood sorrel// Poached Isle of Gigha halibut - Atlantic King crab, finger lime, ras el hanout infused broth// Braised, confit and roasted Herdwick lamb - spring vegetable 'navarin'// Soup - pineapple, coconut, kaffir lime// Pineapple coconut and kaffir lime mousse*// Sorbet - English Breakfast tea, mint// Lemonade parfait - honey, bergamot, sheep's milk yoghurt// Elderflower jelly, strawberry ice cream coated in white chocolate,	i ordered the  145 prestige tasting menu at restaurant gordon ramsey  and while most courses tasted good  none were quite mind blowing  it s usually the other way around  but i actually thought the entrees were significantly better than the appetizers or desserts  in particular  the lamb was delicious but the ravioli and lemonade parfait were ordinary  i was hoping that this restaurant would top my list of favorite michelin experiences in london  but unfortunately that didn t happen  oh also  what s up with the co ed bathroom    peas  radish  mint  onion  goat s cheese    pressed foie gras   green apples  turnips  watercress  smoked duck   ravioli   lobster  langoustine  salmon  oxtails and wood sorrel   poached isle of gigha halibut   atlantic king crab  finger lime  ras el hanout infused broth   braised  confit and roasted herdwick lamb   spring vegetable  navarin    soup   pineapple  coconut  kaffir lime   pineapple coconut and kaffir lime mousse    sorbet   english breakfast tea  mint   lemonade parfait   honey  bergamot  sheep s milk yoghurt   elderflower jelly  strawberry ice cream coated in white chocolate 
68	5.0	It had always been my dream to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. While my friend and I were traveling and exploring London I made sure to make reservations here. I was a little under the weather and had lost my voice. The staff was so kind they brought me hot chamomile tea with honey, on them. The food was incredible. So flavorful but lite. I had a wonderful plate of roasted vegetables with a balsamic reduction and my friend had Gordon's signature suckling pig cooked 5 different ways. We enjoyed every bite surrounded by the most attentive service we've ever received. The manager even offered us a tour of the kitchen! I guess it was obvious we were tourists but getting to see all of the chefs at work bustling around and how organized the back of the house was just made our experience that much more memorable. I am so thankful that I was able to experience something like that!	it had always been my dream to eat at one of gordon ramsay s restaurant  while my friend and i were traveling and exploring london i made sure to make reservations here  i was a little under the weather and had lost my voice  the staff was so kind they brought me hot chamomile tea with honey  on them  the food was incredible  so flavorful but lite  i had a wonderful plate of roasted vegetables with a balsamic reduction and my friend had gordon s signature suckling pig cooked 5 different ways  we enjoyed every bite surrounded by the most attentive service we ve ever received  the manager even offered us a tour of the kitchen  i guess it was obvious we were tourists but getting to see all of the chefs at work bustling around and how organized the back of the house was just made our experience that much more memorable  i am so thankful that i was able to experience something like that 
69	2.0	Shame on you, Gordon Ramsay. I feel robbed. I'm no food expert, but I do know what a true 3 star restaurant should feel and taste like. I had the pleasure of dinning at French Laundry a couple of years ago. This experience was a joke compared to it. For my first trip to London, I begged my husband to dine at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. I was a huge fan. He agreed, and I was able to book a reservation 2 months in advance. I looked forward to this for 2 months. When time came to it, we dined, and I left feeling like I wasted my money. My husband and I both ordered the prestige tasting menu. (priced at £145 + added £10 cheese supplement)  The food was okay. It started good, then went down hill significantly after the main dish. My pigeon was overcooked, my dessert was lackluster, and the server forced me to eat bleu cheese even though I specified that I don't like bleu cheese after he asked for my preferences. Then it took the servers 30 minutes to give us the check. They ignored our table for the last half of the meal. This was such a disappointing experience. At £155 each, I expected much better. Not worth it.	shame on you  gordon ramsay  i feel robbed  i m no food expert  but i do know what a true 3 star restaurant should feel and taste like  i had the pleasure of dinning at french laundry a couple of years ago  this experience was a joke compared to it  for my first trip to london  i begged my husband to dine at restaurant gordon ramsay  i was a huge fan  he agreed  and i was able to book a reservation 2 months in advance  i looked forward to this for 2 months  when time came to it  we dined  and i left feeling like i wasted my money  my husband and i both ordered the prestige tasting menu   priced at  145   added  10 cheese supplement   the food was okay  it started good  then went down hill significantly after the main dish  my pigeon was overcooked  my dessert was lackluster  and the server forced me to eat bleu cheese even though i specified that i don t like bleu cheese after he asked for my preferences  then it took the servers 30 minutes to give us the check  they ignored our table for the last half of the meal  this was such a disappointing experience  at  155 each  i expected much better  not worth it

71	2.0	"It was my first time visiting London and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was one of reasons why I booked tickets to London. I watched every single tv show Gordon Ramsay was in because I was his big fan!We went there on Oct 20, 2017. I have been checking opentable consistently every day for weeks and luckily got one a month before our trip to London.My bf and I ordered the tasting menu each. Everything was wonderful and very flavorful.We had Lemonade parfait and there was a piece of paper towel in my dessert. I have been to many michelin restaurants... but that never happened to me once, but it can happen. people can make mistakes... so I understood. I called the manager right away and notified the issue, and he brought us a complimentary dessert which was Manjari chocolate delice and guess what. I had a hair in that dessert this time.. hair stuck inside my dessert.. having issues twice in a row.. haha I couldn't believe it. what a great experience when you pay more than $700 for dinner and wine.. I was very surprised and disappointed at the same time. I immediately notified the issue again to different server (spoke to the oldest waiter.. because I couldn't find the same one)... and he brought a new dessert which I left almost more than a half because I already lost my interest in their food. He offered a kitchen tour and also offered some dessert wine as well. He tried so hard to make it up to us which is why I am giving them 2 stars, instead of 1.. Atmosphere here is great and very quite. so many waiters though.. they had almost the same number of waiters as customers. I also didnt understand the purpose of having a ""wine open performance"" - lighting up the candle while opening the wine, etc..I understand that Gordon Ramsay is a big inspiration to people, but I personally think this is what happen when the main chef is not in the kitchen.. All of staff was very kind. but I am truly sad and disappointed about what happened.

72	2.0	"I am so conflicted on my review. I had been waiting for ten years to come to this restaurant so I had very high hopes. The food and wine were very good and the wait staff were almost flawless. I had two bad experiences that were of note: the first being, I'm American and it's perfectly acceptable there to put your credit card on the table as a signal that you are ready to pay. That way the waiters can come by and grab it at their leisure. It says to them ""hey don't worry, when you're ready, no hurry."" Well I put my credit card on the table here and the woman lectures me that that isn't how they do it in Europe and I'm American so I don't understand how it's supposed to be done and blah blah. Like wow, I'm paying a $800 bill and you're going to lecture me like a child?! And then also, I was up sick all night throwing up with food poisoning.

73	5.0	"My second UK three Michelin star experience left me even more impressed than my first in February. From the moment I stepped into the waiting room, I was attended to by a staff member at one point or another throughout the entire night. Michelin says that execution here is flawless and it really is-- I've griped about the waiter bumping into my dining partner's chair throughout the night at Eleven Madison Park and the bizarre music that was played at Alain Ducasse, but the attention to detail given at Gordon Ramsay was unbelievable. The maitre d', Jean Claude, is world class. He memorized my name and addressed me by it every time he came and chatted with me.For food, I selected the menu prestige option: 1) Pressed foie gras: Foie gras doesn't really do anything for me regardless of the restaurant, but this course was still extremely pleasant.2) Ravioli: a single piece was all that was needed. Absolute savory perfection, it's been on the menu for 23 years for a reason3) Poached Isle of Gigha Halibut. Looks like a pillow of air, and tastes just the same. It melted in my mouth with no bad fishy after taste.4) Braised, confit and roasted lamb: a selection of five different cuts of lamb, all of which were  the most tender I've had. The confit lamb was unbelievable.5) Selection of cheeses from the trolley: I selected one of each of the different groupings of cheese, and told my waiter ""the stronger, the better."" He did not disappoint. Their fromagerie is local in the Marylebone district of London6) Sorbet: I had to work for this one-- my instruction was to crush the liquid nitrogen dried mint in my mortar and pestle bowl, and roll the sorbet around it.7) Lemon parfait: Simply exquisite, and a perfect finish to this meal8) Bonus course: I'll leave this one for you to find out on your own ;)I'll be back to England in February for a visit to the Waterside Inn so I'll have a third of now five (to include Araki's addition to the three star list) to compare then."	my second uk three michelin star experience left me even more impressed than my first in february  from the moment i stepped into the waiting room  i was attended to by a staff member at one point or another throughout the entire night  michelin says that execution here is flawless and it really is   i ve griped about the waiter bumping into my dining partner s chair throughout the night at eleven madison park and the bizarre music that was played at alain ducasse  but the attention to detail given at gordon ramsay was unbelievable  the maitre d   jean claude  is world class  he memorized my name and addressed me by it every time he came and chatted with me for food  i selected the menu prestige option  1  pressed foie gras  foie gras doesn t really do anything for me regardless of the restaurant  but this course was still extremely pleasant 2  ravioli  a single piece was all that was needed  absolute savory perfection  it s been on the menu for 23 years for a reason3  poached isle of gigha halibut  looks like a pillow of air  and tastes just the same  it melted in my mouth with no bad fishy after taste 4  braised  confit and roasted lamb  a selection of five different cuts of lamb  all of which were  the most tender i ve had  the confit lamb was unbelievable 5  selection of cheeses from the trolley  i selected one of each of the different groupings of cheese  and told my waiter  the stronger  the better   he did not disappoint  their fromagerie is local in the marylebone district of london6  sorbet  i had to work for this one   my instruction was to crush the liquid nitrogen dried mint in my mortar and pestle bowl  and roll the sorbet around it 7  lemon parfait  simply exquisite  and a perfect finish to this meal8  bonus course  i ll leave this one for you to find out on your own   i ll be back to england in february for a visit to the waterside inn so i ll have a third of now five  to include araki s addition to the three star list  to compare then 
74	5.0	Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a restaurant where I would travel back to London just to eat here. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a truly pampering experience. From the amazing service to the incredible food. Words cannot experience how wonderful our experience was here. Hubby and I visited London a few months ago and while preparing for our trip, one of the first things we did was book a reservation several months in advance for dinner here. You can book your reservation on Opentable. On the night of our reservation we hopped into a black cab and off we went to experience a night we will always remember. Do you know why I liked it? It is a restaurant is where you can chuck your tie, girls can wear flats, take a bottle to the face, and enjoy heavenly 3 star Michelin food with first class service.....with no judgement. My kind of night. Here are some of the highlights of our night : * The hilarious bellman/doorman out front who is the worlds best photographer. *Ladies, there is a small seat behind your table to place your purse. I loved this little touch of detail and consideration. *Intimate elegant dining room with cozy-comfy dining chairs. *If you are going with multiple people, have some fun sharing a seasonal menu and prestige menu. Although each experience is exquisite and delectable on its own, it becomes a higher level of complexity and extravagance when combined (in my hubby and I opinion). Especially during white truffle season. The planning of ingredients merged with platting of choice heightens ones senses boosting the excitement of sampling each piece of artwork(dish).  *Get a bottle, not a glass. Its acceptable/expected to get wine drunk here.*The great staff and service will keep you laughing and smiling the whole night. Their teamwork also is commendable. No one is ever sitting with a dirty empty plate, empty glass of wine, nor crumbs on the table ever. To pull off this feat in such a tight and small space while also working in sync with the kitchen staff is amazing.  (I probably appreciate and value this more due to the fact that I use to work in the food industry).  *Heavy fresh shavings from the enormous and fresh white truffle? Yes please! *People watching within any restaurant is always fun. For example, here it was fun to watch the different styles of table manners from around the world being used.*The staff in addition to their professional service are extremely open, friendly, yet chill which I love. They are open to telling you about their background/life and travel/food tasting plans. Its always fun to meet people from around the world and just simply have a quick chat. Michelin start restaurants are all about the experience and journey they take you on during your visit. Here, it is enough to make a special trip for another visit, which is what a 3 Michelin star stands for.

76	5.0	Long awaited review! Let me start by commending Monsieur Jean-Claude. Your customer service is impeccable. What a genuine good hearted man you are. Service was definitely what was expected from a three Michelin star restaurant. The food surprised me. Each dish had an individual taste that foreign to my taste buds. I adored how there were so much contrast in each dish that made the flavors pop. Presentation was well put together. The only complaint I would truly say I had was that towards the end, I did feel that timing was a little off. It might be from my slight jet lag, but I was nodding off during the last two courses. Great experience and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great food.	long awaited review  let me start by commending monsieur jean claude  your customer service is impeccable  what a genuine good hearted man you are  service was definitely what was expected from a three michelin star restaurant  the food surprised me  each dish had an individual taste that foreign to my taste buds  i adored how there were so much contrast in each dish that made the flavors pop  presentation was well put together  the only complaint i would truly say i had was that towards the end  i did feel that timing was a little off  it might be from my slight jet lag  but i was nodding off during the last two courses  great experience and i would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great food

The restaurant was surprisingly small, but didn't feel crowded at all.  The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed.  The service is impeccable from the moment you walk in. The food was exquisite to look at and as delicious tasting.  We had the menu prestige and every course was worthy of all three stars.	had the opportunity to dine in chef gordon ramsey s 3 michelin star restaurant while in london  the restaurant was surprisingly small  but didn t feel crowded at all   the atmosphere was lovely and relaxed   the service is impeccable from the moment you walk in  the food was exquisite to look at and as delicious tasting   we had the menu prestige and every course was worthy of all three stars 
78	4.0	I won't be posting all pictures as I think they are the same as all recent reviews. So just the two worth noting is one on duck foie gras - excellent crispy on the outside and buttery inside. It was quite heated-warm on the outside but just cold-warm inside. The halibut was superb. Never had it this way. Very soft like sashimi. Pros - when you go to a 3 stars mich resto, you expect your dishes to be superb. Yes you will get superb food. Cons - We were 10min late. And upon arrival, we were advised that we may need to drink our coffee outside at the reception area. Is that how you treat your guest? Tables are really small for two-persons. Need to relocate my glasses everytime when food came. Tables are really crowded as well. The person from the other table next to me was really just right next to me. The dining area is really packed and busy. Waiters and waitresses were walking back and forth non-stops, not serving food tho, just checking on people to see if they were finished or not. Keep on coming up to refill the water even just after one sip. Gosh, so stressed. Not really fine-dinig atmosphere. Waiters were fine. But the waitresses all look so uptight and no smile at all... I think what put together a 3-star resto means more than just the food. Also the atmosphere, services, comfortness. Gordon Ramsay's resto only has quality food. All the other 3 points are lacking. I would just give it a 2-star...	i won t be posting all pictures as i think they are the same as all recent reviews  so just the two worth noting is one on duck foie gras   excellent crispy on the outside and buttery inside  it was quite heated warm on the outside but just cold warm inside  the halibut was superb  never had it this way  very soft like sashimi  pros   when you go to a 3 stars mich resto  you expect your dishes to be superb  yes you will get superb food  cons   we were 10min late  and upon arrival  we were advised that we may need to drink our coffee outside at the reception area  is that how you treat your guest  tables are really small for two persons  need to relocate my glasses everytime when food came  tables are really crowded as well  the person from the other table next to me was really just right next to me  the dining area is really packed and busy  waiters and waitresses were walking back and forth non stops  not serving food tho  just checking on people to see if they were finished or not  keep on coming up to refill the water even just after one sip  gosh  so stressed  not really fine dinig atmosphere  waiters were fine  but the waitresses all look so uptight and no smile at all    i think what put together a 3 star resto means more than just the food  also the atmosphere  services  comfortness  gordon ramsay s resto only has quality food  all the other 3 points are lacking  i would just give it a 2 star   
79	5.0	This was by far, the most expensive, yet the most amazing gastronomic experience I've ever had in my life. With 3 menus to choose from, I did the classic tasting menu to get the full treatment. To make a long story short, each of the items that I had were prepared beautifully (just look at the photos), oh and they all tasted very good to brilliant. I was up sold on the truffle pasta special, The fancy ordeal of the truffle shavings and the sauce was great fun at 35 pounds.What made my bill go so astronomical after it was all said and done (346 pounds but who's counting), was ordering glasses of wine, willy-nilly, not realizing the price or not caring, to be quite honest.Overall, I was completely satisfied, amazed, and had the best eating experience of my entire life! In fact at the end of the event the maître d' took me into the kitchen to take a look! I loved that. I don't know if he did it out of pity or they normally do that but I loved it. Was it worth the cost, no... but would I do it again... yes - but knowing what I know now, I'll be a little more strategic in what I order and thus, more cost-effective.	this was by far  the most expensive  yet the most amazing gastronomic experience i ve ever had in my life  with 3 menus to choose from  i did the classic tasting menu to get the full treatment  to make a long story short  each of the items that i had were prepared beautifully  just look at the photos   oh and they all tasted very good to brilliant  i was up sold on the truffle pasta special  the fancy ordeal of the truffle shavings and the sauce was great fun at 35 pounds what made my bill go so astronomical after it was all said and done  346 pounds but who s counting   was ordering glasses of wine  willy nilly  not realizing the price or not caring  to be quite honest overall  i was completely satisfied  amazed  and had the best eating experience of my entire life  in fact at the end of the event the ma tre d  took me into the kitchen to take a look  i loved that  i don t know if he did it out of pity or they normally do that but i loved it  was it worth the cost  no    but would i do it again    yes   but knowing what i know now  i ll be a little more strategic in what i order and thus  more cost effective 
80	5.0	We just had a delightful evening.  For us, this type of thing is an annual splurge, not a regular event.  The service was excellent.   Attentive to the max but not in the way.   The courses each arrived seamlessly, and each had distinctive flavors and presentation.   The whole evening had that feeling of being a special evening, just as it should be.   Well done!	we just had a delightful evening   for us  this type of thing is an annual splurge  not a regular event   the service was excellent    attentive to the max but not in the way    the courses each arrived seamlessly  and each had distinctive flavors and presentation    the whole evening had that feeling of being a special evening  just as it should be    well done

82	3.0	In my opinion, the experience of a Three Star Michelin restaurant is comprised of the total experience.  We had the last 2:15 pm lunch seating and enjoyed all but the last 15 minutes of our meal when housekeeping decided it was time to start steaming the tablecloths for the evening service which was to begin in 2.5 hours. My wife asked if they could hold off until we finished but for some reason they would not.  We were moved to the lobby at which time my wife was escorted to the ladies room only to have a male attendant remain in the room.  With that, she was disgusted and left the restaurant and I followed.  We had the menu Prestige with the wine pairing.  They set the pacing of the meal and everything was perfect until those unfortunate final minutes.The service was outstanding and the finesse was superb.  We have dined at numerous great restaurants but have never been moved out of the dining room so they could prepare for the next seating.  I did ask for a manager but none was available.  We did not get to enjoy the dessert or the wine pairing for it.  We won't be back.  I would suggest that a manager stay in the establishment until the last service has been completed.My original rating was a one star but in reflection the food and service was amazing until they were ready to begin preparations for the dinner seating.  A management failure.	in my opinion  the experience of a three star michelin restaurant is comprised of the total experience   we had the last 2 15 pm lunch seating and enjoyed all but the last 15 minutes of our meal when housekeeping decided it was time to start steaming the tablecloths for the evening service which was to begin in 2 5 hours  my wife asked if they could hold off until we finished but for some reason they would not   we were moved to the lobby at which time my wife was escorted to the ladies room only to have a male attendant remain in the room   with that  she was disgusted and left the restaurant and i followed   we had the menu prestige with the wine pairing   they set the pacing of the meal and everything was perfect until those unfortunate final minutes the service was outstanding and the finesse was superb   we have dined at numerous great restaurants but have never been moved out of the dining room so they could prepare for the next seating   i did ask for a manager but none was available   we did not get to enjoy the dessert or the wine pairing for it   we won t be back   i would suggest that a manager stay in the establishment until the last service has been completed my original rating was a one star but in reflection the food and service was amazing until they were ready to begin preparations for the dinner seating   a management failure 
83	1.0	My wife and I ate at the restaurant on Monday, November 20th, 2017. We were one of the first tables seated for the evening.Initially, things were going great. We were greeted nicely, the staff helped us to take off our coats and escorted us to our table. We both ordered the Menu Prestige and asked for the selection of cheeses to be added on.Then, our experience went downhill. I ordered a wine supplement with my meal. This included five glasses of wine for a price of around £110-130. This price range was specified in the menu. After ordering, one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill. Then, he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement, and asked us if we are aware of the cost. I was very confused by this - I've never been asked if I was aware of the cost of something I was ordering. It seemed a bit insulting - as if we would not be able to afford the (very reasonable) price. Neither my wife nor I were under-dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner. I even wore a tie. The service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner, as if we were being looked down upon.On to the food. The initial courses were outstanding - the foie gras, the ravioli, and the poached halibut. Unfortunately, the mains were underwhelming. My wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and I did not feel that the lamb was anything special - definitely not for a three-star restaurant. The dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable.The experience of the cheese course was strange. Our server brought a trolley, from which we could make a selection of four. My wife and I asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like. We stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses. He insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes. We decided not to make a fuss about it.After eating and having our table cleared, we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill. Eventually, we got the attention of one of the servers, who did apologize for taking so long with the bill. We felt that given the price we were paying for the experience, such a wait was unwarranted.When the bill did arrive, we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses. The price on the menu was £10, but we were charged £18 each. I did not notice until we have left the restaurant, and going back or calling to complain over £16 seemed unnecessary. The lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing. Perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did, in fact, change. I've uploaded a photo of our bill, along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant's website.Overall, my wife and I were not happy with the experience. We have eaten at three-star and one-star restaurants prior to visiting Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and have had much better experiences at each of them. We did not expect to be so disappointed by Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.	my wife and i ate at the restaurant on monday  november 20th  2017  we were one of the first tables seated for the evening initially  things were going great  we were greeted nicely  the staff helped us to take off our coats and escorted us to our table  we both ordered the menu prestige and asked for the selection of cheeses to be added on then  our experience went downhill  i ordered a wine supplement with my meal  this included five glasses of wine for a price of around  110 130  this price range was specified in the menu  after ordering  one of the servers came up to the table and asked us who is paying for the bill  then  he opened the menu to the page that listed the price of the wine supplement  and asked us if we are aware of the cost  i was very confused by this   i ve never been asked if i was aware of the cost of something i was ordering  it seemed a bit insulting   as if we would not be able to afford the  very reasonable  price  neither my wife nor i were under dressed for this occasion of a fancy dinner  i even wore a tie  the service continued to be rather pretentious throughout dinner  as if we were being looked down upon on to the food  the initial courses were outstanding   the foie gras  the ravioli  and the poached halibut  unfortunately  the mains were underwhelming  my wife did not enjoy her roast pigeon and i did not feel that the lamb was anything special   definitely not for a three star restaurant  the dessert was tasty but not particularly memorable the experience of the cheese course was strange  our server brought a trolley  from which we could make a selection of four  my wife and i asked our server for recommendations and he asked us what cheeses we liked and did not like  we stated that we did not like bleu cheese or similar cheeses  he insisted that we must try it and placed it on our plate against our wishes  we decided not to make a fuss about it after eating and having our table cleared  we awkwardly waited around 20 minutes for the bill  eventually  we got the attention of one of the servers  who did apologize for taking so long with the bill  we felt that given the price we were paying for the experience  such a wait was unwarranted when the bill did arrive  we seem to have been overcharged for the selection of cheeses  the price on the menu was  10  but we were charged  18 each  i did not notice until we have left the restaurant  and going back or calling to complain over  16 seemed unnecessary  the lack of attention regarding billing was a bit disappointing  perhaps the menus need to be updated if the price did  in fact  change  i ve uploaded a photo of our bill  along with a screenshot of the menu from the restaurant s website overall  my wife and i were not happy with the experience  we have eaten at three star and one star restaurants prior to visiting restaurant gordon ramsay  and have had much better experiences at each of them  we did not expect to be so disappointed by restaurant gordon ramsay 
84	2.0	Decor:  Kind of small.  Too much white.Food:  Lots of frothy things.  Ok presentation.   Foie gras portion was too large.  Sorbet at end of meal looked kind of like a turd.Wine:  not sure how a wine pairing with their tasting menu isn't a standard request...  Service:  A member of our party had a nut allergy.  They served her a dish with a nut in it.  They said there wasn't a nut in it.  But there was.  She could have died.  Good thing she mushed up stuff under the fish before taking a bite.  Staff didn't really care about how big their fuckup was.  The reason for the fuckup is because:  a) too many people involved and b) they take the weekend off so when Friday night comes around, everyone is already checked out.Bottom line:  Gordon Ramsey checked out of this place a long time ago to move onto bigger things.	decor   kind of small   too much white food   lots of frothy things   ok presentation    foie gras portion was too large   sorbet at end of meal looked kind of like a turd wine   not sure how a wine pairing with their tasting menu isn t a standard request     service   a member of our party had a nut allergy   they served her a dish with a nut in it   they said there wasn t a nut in it   but there was   she could have died   good thing she mushed up stuff under the fish before taking a bite   staff didn t really care about how big their fuckup was   the reason for the fuckup is because   a  too many people involved and b  they take the weekend off so when friday night comes around  everyone is already checked out bottom line   gordon ramsey checked out of this place a long time ago to move onto bigger things 
85	4.0	Being one of the most famous chefs in the world, Gordon Ramsay is a must try during my trip to London. While I had high expectations, I was also quite excited to try this restaurant.Seared foie gras (5/5): this was very well done. the pairing of the flavor with the sauces and the cherry was outstanding. Also because i just LOVE foie gras.Pigeon (3/5): while I do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious... this dish was way too salty. The saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients.Lemon yogurt dessert (4/5): i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt, if I remember correctly. It was delicious but not something that was spectacular. Though, the presentation was beautiful.Service was lovely though, and the ambiance top-notch.	being one of the most famous chefs in the world  gordon ramsay is a must try during my trip to london  while i had high expectations  i was also quite excited to try this restaurant seared foie gras  5 5   this was very well done  the pairing of the flavor with the sauces and the cherry was outstanding  also because i just love foie gras pigeon  3 5   while i do like pigeons and the skin was crispy and delicious    this dish was way too salty  the saltiness overpowered the taste of the pigeon and the other wonderful ingredients lemon yogurt dessert  4 5   i forgot the exact name of the dessert but it was kind of citrusy with some goat yogurt  if i remember correctly  it was delicious but not something that was spectacular  though  the presentation was beautiful service was lovely though  and the ambiance top notch

It is a great restaurant because there is a good atmosphere and tasty dishes are served. I would recommend this restaurant to people who like good and tasty food. The food was incredible. I had a wonderful plate of Ravioli and I fell in love with this kind of food.Definitely, this is my favorite place !	it was a good idea to visit this restaurant when we were in london  i visited this restaurant for the first time in 2017 and it became my favorite restaurant in town  it is a great restaurant because there is a good atmosphere and tasty dishes are served  i would recommend this restaurant to people who like good and tasty food  the food was incredible  i had a wonderful plate of ravioli and i fell in love with this kind of food definitely  this is my favorite place  
87	3.0	This is one of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in London so I have decided to splash out and try it since I am a foodie.  This establishment is located in Chelsea and it is quite a walk from the tube station so do plan your journey a bit.  We were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as I think there was some cancellation.The restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate.  I was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed.  However, due to the number of people in the room, everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was here with a friend and not a date so it didn't really bothered me.The service was beyond perfect and I give them full marks for it.  Very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done.  We are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude.  This is what makes a good restaurant.  The wine list is extensive.  We asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired.  If you want to pair it with your 7 courses, it is usually about £100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you. I am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that I have tried.  I had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu.  The pictures that I have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes.  We also tried a bit of each other's food so that we know how the food was compared to other Michelin star restaurants.  Unfortunately for us, the food I have to say is not up to a 3 Michelin star quality.  Maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but I have been to some 1 & 2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  I believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that I am paying.  The Prestige menu was priced at £145 and the Seasonal menu was priced at £175.  Of course, the Seasonal menu tasted better than the Prestige menu since it is more expensive.  I think this is a one in a lifetime experience which I agree as it is after all a 3 Michelin star restaurant from Gordon Ramsay.  However, I don't think I will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try.  Just not value for money and definitely not a 3 Michelin star I was expecting food wise.  Sorry but I do think you guys can definitely do better on the food.  The rating I have provided reflects the value and also the quality & flavour of the food when compared with other Michelin starred restaurants I have tried.	this is one of the 3 michelin star restaurants in london so i have decided to splash out and try it since i am a foodie   this establishment is located in chelsea and it is quite a walk from the tube station so do plan your journey a bit   we were lucky to get a table for 2 about 3 weeks before the reservation date as i think there was some cancellation the restaurant is actually quite small and very intimate   i was hoping the atmosphere was going to be quite chilled and relaxed   however  due to the number of people in the room  everyone was talking away and it is actually quite noisy for a michelin starred restaurant   i was here with a friend and not a date so it didn t really bothered me the service was beyond perfect and i give them full marks for it   very attentive waiters and waitresses and no mistake done   we are not locals and we could see quite a few tables with foreigners here but everyone was treated with respect and with no attitude   this is what makes a good restaurant   the wine list is extensive   we asked the sommelier to recommend wines that go well with our courses and all of them were perfectly paired   if you want to pair it with your 7 courses  it is usually about  100 per person but you may have less and pay less so it really is up to you  i am not going to go into details on each of the dishes that i have tried   i had the seasonal tasting menu and my friend had the prestige tasting menu   the pictures that i have posted speaks for itself and what you will be expecting from the dishes   we also tried a bit of each other s food so that we know how the food was compared to other michelin star restaurants   unfortunately for us  the food i have to say is not up to a 3 michelin star quality   maybe we went in expecting too much from this restaurant but i have been to some 1   2 starred restaurants and the flavour and taste of their food did surpass restaurant gordon ramsay   i believe that the quality and taste of the food is more geared towards a 1 star quality especially for the price that i am paying   the prestige menu was priced at  145 and the seasonal menu was priced at  175   of course  the seasonal menu tasted better than the prestige menu since it is more expensive   i think this is a one in a lifetime experience which i agree as it is after all a 3 michelin star restaurant from gordon ramsay   however  i don t think i will come back as we came here to give a 3 star a try   just not value for money and definitely not a 3 michelin star i was expecting food wise   sorry but i do think you guys can definitely do better on the food   the rating i have provided reflects the value and also the quality   flavour of the food when compared with other michelin starred restaurants i have tried

89	4.0	The food: Delicious. Beautiful presentation. My particular favorites: The ravioli. The pigeon (the pigeon was so tender and perfectly flavored). The cheese selection I added onto our menu. The service: Awkward? I don't know how to better describe the service experience. They were constantly buzzing around in this tiny room and I just felt like I had no personal space. The servers were also not as eloquent and refined as I expected from a restaurant of this caliber. At one point, a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water...And it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend's....So that was strange. There was a lot of hovering and a lack of smooth rotation, in my mind. I don't quite know how better to explain it.I'd of course recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion or visiting London with a desire to have an exemplary fine dining experience. I just was expecting a 10/10 experience.	the food  delicious  beautiful presentation  my particular favorites  the ravioli  the pigeon  the pigeon was so tender and perfectly flavored   the cheese selection i added onto our menu  the service  awkward  i don t know how to better describe the service experience  they were constantly buzzing around in this tiny room and i just felt like i had no personal space  the servers were also not as eloquent and refined as i expected from a restaurant of this caliber  at one point  a server poured sparkling water in my glass half full of still water   and it was quite clear that the still bottled water was in front of my glass and the sparkling water bottle was in front of my boyfriend s    so that was strange  there was a lot of hovering and a lack of smooth rotation  in my mind  i don t quite know how better to explain it i d of course recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion or visiting london with a desire to have an exemplary fine dining experience  i just was expecting a 10 10 experience 
90	5.0	This place is well worth whatever you happen to pay and whatever trouble it might take you to get there (which hopefully, isn't very much- it's easily found).Service: impeccable. Not hovering, but exceptionally cognizant of what you need. They're attentive & friendly, willing to answer questions.Food (vegetarian review):  outstanding. And filling. By the 4th course or so, it was getting to the point of uncomfortably full. They have a vegetarian menu that has several choices to piece together a 3 course meal. It does not include dessert- it's an add-on.You can opt to make it a 7 course ('prestige') meal as well, which is pretty much everything on the vegetarian menu (you have to choose between a cheese plate or a soup). It comes with both desserts. I'm sure the menu changes, but they did some cool things- I crushed leaves in a mortar w/a pestle as part of dessert, balls of ice cream came out in dry ice, and there were all sorts of crackle-y, crispy things to crunch your way through.

91	5.0	Had a difficult time deciding on which Gordon Ramsay restaurant to try in London, but so glad we were able to book a spot at his flagship 3 Michelin star restaurant. This was an dining experience we will never forget and well worth it.Food and service was superb, not to mention the many complimentary chef surprises. We loved our conversations with Jean Claude the maitre d.  He has a fantastic way of connecting with people and made us feel so warm and welcomed. We decided to go.with the 3 course lunch menu and ordered the Buckwheat gnocchi and Dexter beef tartar, followed by the Roast Cornish skate and roast venison and finally finishing off with the custard tart. It's hard to say which was our favorite because they all tasted so fantastic and hard to single out one.In addition to what we ordered, we were presented with many surprises from the chef that were so delicious that words alone cannot describe what we had. The complexity of the flavors and beauty of the presentation was phenomenal. Hats of to Matt Abe, head chef, which we had the great pleasure of meeting when Jean Claude invited us to a kitchen tour. There is a reason this is a 3 Michelin star restaurant and it was well worth it.The food and staff shine here.	had a difficult time deciding on which gordon ramsay restaurant to try in london  but so glad we were able to book a spot at his flagship 3 michelin star restaurant  this was an dining experience we will never forget and well worth it food and service was superb  not to mention the many complimentary chef surprises  we loved our conversations with jean claude the maitre d   he has a fantastic way of connecting with people and made us feel so warm and welcomed  we decided to go with the 3 course lunch menu and ordered the buckwheat gnocchi and dexter beef tartar  followed by the roast cornish skate and roast venison and finally finishing off with the custard tart  it s hard to say which was our favorite because they all tasted so fantastic and hard to single out one in addition to what we ordered  we were presented with many surprises from the chef that were so delicious that words alone cannot describe what we had  the complexity of the flavors and beauty of the presentation was phenomenal  hats of to matt abe  head chef  which we had the great pleasure of meeting when jean claude invited us to a kitchen tour  there is a reason this is a 3 michelin star restaurant and it was well worth it the food and staff shine here 
92	5.0	Three Michelin stars since 2001 huh? They definitely deserve it. The wine list is extensive and detailed. Have fun with that if you're a connoisseur.Impeccable service à la russe in an unassuming location, with 3 prix fixe menus to choose from. My cousin and I each had the menu prestige, and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible. (see photos)My favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon. What really blew me away was the texture of the dish. It was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood. To keep it short, every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection. The dishes are influenced by local flavors (you'll see it in the herbs, especially) so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine. The decor could have used a little help. The wood paneling on the walls makes me think they're getting ready to pack up and close shop. The seating is intimate, and we had a wonderful table right next to the window. The service itself from making the reservation to leaving the restaurant was beyond expectation. No detail is too small for their staff.	three michelin stars since 2001 huh  they definitely deserve it  the wine list is extensive and detailed  have fun with that if you re a connoisseur impeccable service   la russe in an unassuming location  with 3 prix fixe menus to choose from  my cousin and i each had the menu prestige  and made slightly different choices to try to cover as much variety as possible   see photos my favorite dish was the ravioli of lobster  langoustine  and salmon  what really blew me away was the texture of the dish  it was perfectly folded and completely packed full of seafood  to keep it short  every dish was cooked exactly as described to perfection  the dishes are influenced by local flavors  you ll see it in the herbs  especially  so it is a good way to become intimate with that cuisine  the decor could have used a little help  the wood paneling on the walls makes me think they re getting ready to pack up and close shop  the seating is intimate  and we had a wonderful table right next to the window  the service itself from making the reservation to leaving the restaurant was beyond expectation  no detail is too small for their staff 
93	2.0	I have eaten at many 3 Michelin resurants and this one just didn't stand out to me. None of the dishes stood out to me and i have to say i was a little disappointed.Amuse-bouche:1. Truffle bun: This was delicious2. Salmon wrapped in seaweed: had something crunchy inside that was so yummy3. Prosciutto wrap:Bread:1. Bacon onion brioche: Yum!! Didn't even bother with the other bread options.We Ordered:1. Egg shell filled: Tasted like creamy bacon potato soup inside2. Pressed Foie Gras: I am not a fan of foie pâté to begin with, but then i found a piece of what looked like string or i'm thinking part of the animal in the pâté i pulled out, which is a big no no for a restaurant of this caliber.3. Lobster Ravioli4. Poached Halibut in infused broth5. Lamb: Confit, braised and roasted. Delicious. My favorite was the lamb confit6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup (option instead of cheese trolley)7. Cheese Plate8. Muddled freeze dried rose petal with lemon sorbet refresher9. Coffee Soufflé - perfect10. Lemonade parfait - very light and delicious11. Chocolate Hazelnut praline dessert12. The petits fours - the chocolate brittle was deliciousOverall, It was good. Compared to other Michelin restaurants nothing really stood out to me as being amazing or innovative or just down right delicious.	i have eaten at many 3 michelin resurants and this one just didn t stand out to me  none of the dishes stood out to me and i have to say i was a little disappointed amuse bouche 1  truffle bun  this was delicious2  salmon wrapped in seaweed  had something crunchy inside that was so yummy3  prosciutto wrap bread 1  bacon onion brioche  yum   didn t even bother with the other bread options we ordered 1  egg shell filled  tasted like creamy bacon potato soup inside2  pressed foie gras  i am not a fan of foie p t  to begin with  but then i found a piece of what looked like string or i m thinking part of the animal in the p t  i pulled out  which is a big no no for a restaurant of this caliber 3  lobster ravioli4  poached halibut in infused broth5  lamb  confit  braised and roasted  delicious  my favorite was the lamb confit6  mango  jasmine and passion fruit soup  option instead of cheese trolley 7  cheese plate8  muddled freeze dried rose petal with lemon sorbet refresher9  coffee souffl    perfect10  lemonade parfait   very light and delicious11  chocolate hazelnut praline dessert12  the petits fours   the chocolate brittle was deliciousoverall  it was good  compared to other michelin restaurants nothing really stood out to me as being amazing or innovative or just down right delicious

95	5.0	Had a lovely meal of late with my partner and our 18 year old son - who had no idea about the experience of which he was to partake. The fare matched or exceeded the finest of our US dining experiences, including the French Laundry. Our son had a huge smile and his camera ready as each impeccably-served course was laid before him, including the apple gratin with caramel sauce for 2, which he polished off all on his own. We were prepared to splurge on a 'prestige' wine and were pleasantly surprised when the sommelier (1 of 3 on duty that night) helped us choose a reasonably priced and delicious Argentinian Carmenere. We typically prefer our meals a bit more rustic, but would count this in our top 3 meals of all time.	had a lovely meal of late with my partner and our 18 year old son   who had no idea about the experience of which he was to partake  the fare matched or exceeded the finest of our us dining experiences  including the french laundry  our son had a huge smile and his camera ready as each impeccably served course was laid before him  including the apple gratin with caramel sauce for 2  which he polished off all on his own  we were prepared to splurge on a  prestige  wine and were pleasantly surprised when the sommelier  1 of 3 on duty that night  helped us choose a reasonably priced and delicious argentinian carmenere  we typically prefer our meals a bit more rustic  but would count this in our top 3 meals of all time 
96	5.0	Lived up to expectations. The end. Just kidding, we had a great meal and experience. The staff, food, wine list and decor are 5 star.  They brought out a small starter to awaken the taste buds which was a truffle mouse in an egg shell.  My first Course was the lobster ravioli which was stuffed with delicious lobster meat and my husband had the homemade pasta dish w a frothy prosciutto sauce. For second course I had the lamb which prepared in a few different ways and my husband has the Red Deer Venison. Both were great...of course my lamb was the best! ;) For dessert we both had the cheese Course which came out on a large cart. It was glorious! We ended with coffee which they bring to everyone with some tasty little treats. I was so stuffed!! The wine list was all I could have hoped for too with plenty of Bordeaux to chose from! And they even took us on a tour of the kitchen! I highly recommend! Of course as a Michelin star restaurant be ready to pull out your wallet!	lived up to expectations  the end  just kidding  we had a great meal and experience  the staff  food  wine list and decor are 5 star   they brought out a small starter to awaken the taste buds which was a truffle mouse in an egg shell   my first course was the lobster ravioli which was stuffed with delicious lobster meat and my husband had the homemade pasta dish w a frothy prosciutto sauce  for second course i had the lamb which prepared in a few different ways and my husband has the red deer venison  both were great   of course my lamb was the best     for dessert we both had the cheese course which came out on a large cart  it was glorious  we ended with coffee which they bring to everyone with some tasty little treats  i was so stuffed   the wine list was all i could have hoped for too with plenty of bordeaux to chose from  and they even took us on a tour of the kitchen  i highly recommend  of course as a michelin star restaurant be ready to pull out your wallet 
97	5.0	It really doesn't get any better. You really do get what you pay for here. The fois gras and sweetbreads were food heaven. I have no vocabulary to describe the Suckling pig. Crispy, sweet, the absolute essence of pork. Sublime. The caramelized Tarte Tatin with a glass of chilled Sauterne. It's really beyond words. Wonderful service, subdued atmosphere and not a hint of snobbery. In a class on its own.	it really doesn t get any better  you really do get what you pay for here  the fois gras and sweetbreads were food heaven  i have no vocabulary to describe the suckling pig  crispy  sweet  the absolute essence of pork  sublime  the caramelized tarte tatin with a glass of chilled sauterne  it s really beyond words  wonderful service  subdued atmosphere and not a hint of snobbery  in a class on its own

99	5.0	Wow.Honestly, did you expect anything else? The volatile celebrity chef really does know what he's doing when it comes to restaurants. Easily the best dinner experience of my life.Came here on a Monday evening with 2 other acquaintances visiting from Italy. Since we are all from America and only staying in Europe for short time, we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner. The service was wonderful. The sommelier, instinctively telling that we were college students, gave my friends (I don't drink) a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation, which they eagerly accepted. The matire'd, apparently renowned in London for his welcoming nature, greeted us, asked where we were from, and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn't seem to belong. All three of us got the tasting menu, The food was stunning. Everything was prepared incredibly carefully, and the presentation was a visual masterpiece. We couldn't help but to take pictures of the food, which I feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated. It started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs. Next camethe pressed Foie Gras, which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples.Then we moved onto the Isle of Gigha Halibut, which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth. The flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise, both visually and in flavor.The Ravioli of lobster, langoustine, and salmon is undeniably the star of the show, being one of the signature dishes. Easily the best ravioli I've ever had in my life, I was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate. I eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it.Next were the Cotswold lamb, Mango Jasmine and passion fruit soup, Cucumber sorbet (which was used as a palate cleanser), and finally dessert with Lemonade parfait. The Lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal. It was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious. After our meal, the matire'd actually invited us into the kitchen. We were eager to see Claire and thank her for the meal, but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished. The kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right, as I have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before, much less that of a 3-star Michelin one!Afterwards, our maitre'd bid us farewell, wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states. I was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant.It's been a few months since that night, but I still look back upon it with fondness. Hopefully one day I will be able to return to Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and enjoy another unforgettable meal.	wow honestly  did you expect anything else  the volatile celebrity chef really does know what he s doing when it comes to restaurants  easily the best dinner experience of my life came here on a monday evening with 2 other acquaintances visiting from italy  since we are all from america and only staying in europe for short time  we figured we might as well treat ourselves to a extremely special dinner  the service was wonderful  the sommelier  instinctively telling that we were college students  gave my friends  i don t drink  a cheap but wonderful wine recommendation  which they eagerly accepted  the matire d  apparently renowned in london for his welcoming nature  greeted us  asked where we were from  and genuinely seemed interested in a trio of kids that didn t seem to belong  all three of us got the tasting menu  the food was stunning  everything was prepared incredibly carefully  and the presentation was a visual masterpiece  we couldn t help but to take pictures of the food  which i feared would make us stand out in a room of the mature and sophisticated  it started with a small collection of starters that included scotch eggs  next camethe pressed foie gras  which had a smooth texture and sweet tartness to it due to the green apples then we moved onto the isle of gigha halibut  which was presented with this ras el hanout infused broth  the flowers that laid atop the delicate fish were a delightful surprise  both visually and in flavor the ravioli of lobster  langoustine  and salmon is undeniably the star of the show  being one of the signature dishes  easily the best ravioli i ve ever had in my life  i was saddened when it so quickly disappeared off my plate  i eased the pain away by licking the delicious bisque that accompanied it next were the cotswold lamb  mango jasmine and passion fruit soup  cucumber sorbet  which was used as a palate cleanser   and finally dessert with lemonade parfait  the lemonade parfait was truly an incredible way to finish off the meal  it was possibly the most beautifully extravagant concept for a dessert i have ever had the pleasure of eating  the transparent sauce that aligned the plate was especially delicious  after our meal  the matire d actually invited us into the kitchen  we were eager to see claire and thank her for the meal  but unfortunately she had left by the time we finished  the kitchen trip was a unique experience in its own right  as i have never seen the kitchen of a restaurant before  much less that of a 3 star michelin one afterwards  our maitre d bid us farewell  wishing us a good night and safe travels back to our respective homes in the states  i was astonished he actually remembered all of our cities  but in retrospect  i shouldn t have been surprised such an impressive man would be in charge of such an incredible restaurant it s been a few months since that night  but i still look back upon it with fondness  hopefully one day i will be able to return to restaurant gordon ramsay  and enjoy another unforgettable meal

Although his restaurant within Trianon Palais Hotel in Paris is my favorite, I absolutely loved dinner here. The lemon parfait dessert was perfect icing on a five star dinner that was creative and full of delicious flavors. Service was five stars and flawless as expected.	gordon ramsay is an amazing chef and his restaurants never fail to deliver a fantastic meal regardless of city  although his restaurant within trianon palais hotel in paris is my favorite  i absolutely loved dinner here  the lemon parfait dessert was perfect icing on a five star dinner that was creative and full of delicious flavors  service was five stars and flawless as expected 
102	5.0	So we made reservations for two people six months ahead of time as that was how far out they were booked I had the Menu Prestige (£145) and my date had the Season Inspiration Menu (£195)- both choices were terrific in their own right. The evening started off with three little sets of complimentary dim sum-like gems from the kitchen. Each bite was exquisite and we saw that no two tables had quite the same complimentary gems to start. Good touch! The plates from Menu Prestige are as follows: 1. Pressed foie gras, green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - This was good but it wasn't as good as the other dishes. 2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel - This was easily the best savory dish from the whole set. It was just heavenly. 3. Isle of Gigha halibut, Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth - The prettiest broth I have ever seen - it reminded me of colorful sakura blossoms drifting about on pond water. 4. Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey, orange and sautéed foie gras (you can opt for the Cotswold lamb if you wanted to) - this was the main dish. They used every part of the pigeon and it was cooked to perfection. 5. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Simple, wildly fragrant and not too sweet - it was perfect 6. Green apple sorbet with chamomile and marigold - This dish had the most interesting presentation; you are given a mortar and pestle to pound away (gracefully of course) at the frozen herbs to be eaten with the green apple sorbet. Refreshing!7. Lemonade parfait, honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - The most amazing dessert presentation that I have ever seen. The honey had been crystallized to form a perfect centerpiece to complement the yogurt sorbet. After we were done with our dinner, we were invited back to see the magic in the kitchen. Amazing service and superior attention to detail from the whole staff.

103	5.0	Just... wow.  My tastes usually run a bit cheaper than this, but Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is something to be experienced.  The food is delicious and complicated.  The wine matches perfectly.  And the service is impeccable.  Like, ludicrously impeccable.  Watching the intricate way that the staff members weave around each other to keep the maximum number of people doting on the guests the entire time is almost as much fun as enjoying the meal itself.This will very likely always be the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, but it was absolutely worth it.  Eating here is the perfect way to explore what real artists can do with food,and with the dining experience.	just    wow   my tastes usually run a bit cheaper than this  but restaurant gordon ramsay is something to be experienced   the food is delicious and complicated   the wine matches perfectly   and the service is impeccable   like  ludicrously impeccable   watching the intricate way that the staff members weave around each other to keep the maximum number of people doting on the guests the entire time is almost as much fun as enjoying the meal itself this will very likely always be the most expensive meal i have ever eaten  but it was absolutely worth it   eating here is the perfect way to explore what real artists can do with food and with the dining experience 
104	5.0	The lobster ravioli and suckling pig are culinary perfection. The ravioli was fresh and meet of the lobster was creamy, sweet, and perfectly cooked. The pig skin was the best I have ever had, ever. To get that texture takes a lot of experience and time. Great great dishes.The compressed foie gras is complex. The texture and temperature were done perfectly but the dish came out underwhelming in taste and seasoning. With the garnishes it does bring the dish to a different level but I believe the foie gras should be able to stand by itself.Staff was friendly and attends to the tables well. I had a tour of the kitchen and it's superb as you'd expect.	the lobster ravioli and suckling pig are culinary perfection  the ravioli was fresh and meet of the lobster was creamy  sweet  and perfectly cooked  the pig skin was the best i have ever had  ever  to get that texture takes a lot of experience and time  great great dishes the compressed foie gras is complex  the texture and temperature were done perfectly but the dish came out underwhelming in taste and seasoning  with the garnishes it does bring the dish to a different level but i believe the foie gras should be able to stand by itself staff was friendly and attends to the tables well  i had a tour of the kitchen and it s superb as you d expect 
105	4.0	"I won't go into a lot of detail here, there are legions of other reviews for that.  The key points about my experience:1.  The food was phenomenal2. We were treated a little weirdly at timesHere's some detail on point 2: We are American, we are well versed in fine dining.  Does anyone come here who isn't?  You can't exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation...  Anyway, the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings.  The pairing isn't like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price, they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you.  That's fine.  The weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings, she asked us who was hosting the dinner.  We were perplexed, never having been asked that question before, there were only two of us (married couple).  After a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had *just* been perusing.  Yes, we ordered the pairings, we are prepared to pay within the listed price range.  The second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course.  I ordered the pigeon (or squab as we yanks call it) and the server (I think the GM?) asked if I was fine with it being cooked med. rare.  I said yes, that is fine with me, that is how I prefer it.  It seemed as if he didn't quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef's recommendation.  He said ""I don't know, are you sure?  It is served *quite pink*, we can cook it more for you if you prefer...""  I'm not sure what this was about, perhaps they've been burned by too many stupid Americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more?  Or I was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn't know anything?  I can't be sure.  Regardless, the squab was perfection and I ate every bite.  Perhaps this gentleman recognized that he'd misjudged us, he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal, presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal.Ultimately, the meal was fantastic, the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn't ruin it, but I thought it was notable, I've never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before.Hopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback, but I have a feeling that management at establishments such as R GR don't give a hoot about yelp reviews..."	i won t go into a lot of detail here  there are legions of other reviews for that   the key points about my experience 1   the food was phenomenal2  we were treated a little weirdly at timeshere s some detail on point 2  we are american  we are well versed in fine dining   does anyone come here who isn t   you can t exactly walk in off the street or stumble into a reservation     anyway  the first weird thing was that we requested the wine pairings   the pairing isn t like a typical tasting menu where there is a published price  they give you a range because they claim to select wines on a case by case basis after discussing likes and dislikes with you   that s fine   the weird thing was that when my husband told a server that we were interested in pairings  she asked us who was hosting the dinner   we were perplexed  never having been asked that question before  there were only two of us  married couple    after a painful few moments we discerned that she was asking who would be paying for dinner and then verified that we were okay with the range of prices that had been printed on the menu that we had  just  been perusing   yes  we ordered the pairings  we are prepared to pay within the listed price range   the second weird thing was when we selected our chosen main course   i ordered the pigeon  or squab as we yanks call it  and the server  i think the gm   asked if i was fine with it being cooked med  rare   i said yes  that is fine with me  that is how i prefer it   it seemed as if he didn t quite believe me and then basically proceeded to try to talk me out of going with the chef s recommendation   he said  i don t know  are you sure   it is served  quite pink   we can cook it more for you if you prefer      i m not sure what this was about  perhaps they ve been burned by too many stupid americans sending back a beautifully cooked dish to be cooked more   or i was just being profiled as a dumb woman who doesn t know anything   i can t be sure   regardless  the squab was perfection and i ate every bite   perhaps this gentleman recognized that he d misjudged us  he gave us a tour of the kitchen at the end of our meal  presumably to compensate for his somewhat poor behavior earlier in the meal ultimately  the meal was fantastic  the food was fabulous and the weirdness didn t ruin it  but i thought it was notable  i ve never been treated this way in such a highly regarded restaurant before hopefully someone from the restaurant reads this so that they can take the feedback  but i have a feeling that management at establishments such as r gr don t give a hoot about yelp reviews   
106	4.0	If one is to pay ~300 pp for a meal (that's how much the menu prestige will come to after london tax, tip, water, etc.) then this better dinner better knock your socks off.  I better walk away with something to remember, something deserving of praise, and something that will make me say...i will never be able to make that myself.  Well, the halibut in the lime and rose infused broth is to die for.  I spent a good minute just smelling, starring, and appreciating this work of art.  It was so beautiful, my heart cried a little as I carved into the masterpiece.  But then the joy was restored as a party ensued in my mouth.  Unforgettable. My party was the last to leave the restaurant and it was already past midnight, but we didn't feel rushed at all.  If every dinner was like this, I think I would die an extremely happy and round-bodied glutton.The loss of a star is simply secondary to comparison with other 3 michelin star restaurants I've been to...gotta have some standard of comparison!  But this is like saying Tom Brady is a 4 star QB and Peyton Manning is 5 star QB (heehee...just wanted to stir some waters with that comment :)	if one is to pay  300 pp for a meal  that s how much the menu prestige will come to after london tax  tip  water  etc   then this better dinner better knock your socks off   i better walk away with something to remember  something deserving of praise  and something that will make me say   i will never be able to make that myself   well  the halibut in the lime and rose infused broth is to die for   i spent a good minute just smelling  starring  and appreciating this work of art   it was so beautiful  my heart cried a little as i carved into the masterpiece   but then the joy was restored as a party ensued in my mouth   unforgettable  my party was the last to leave the restaurant and it was already past midnight  but we didn t feel rushed at all   if every dinner was like this  i think i would die an extremely happy and round bodied glutton the loss of a star is simply secondary to comparison with other 3 michelin star restaurants i ve been to   gotta have some standard of comparison   but this is like saying tom brady is a 4 star qb and peyton manning is 5 star qb  heehee   just wanted to stir some waters with that comment   
107	4.0	I had to try out a 3 michelin star restaurant so I picked Gordon Ramsay to be the place. {ABOUT}- Booking: Online, I reserved less than a month in advance and I had no problem - Photos are only allowed on your phone (No DSLR's as it bothers the experience of the other patrons) - Dress: Smart Dress Code (jackets are preferred, shirt with a collar required for gentlemen, no T-shirts, shorts, sportswear, sneakers or trainers of any kind)- Cancellation / No Show Fee: £150 /person if you don't cancel within 48 hours - so don't miss it. They will call you a few days ahead to confirm your reservation. {ATMOSPHERE}: 3/5 - A tiny lovely little restaurant. From the outside, it looks so unsuspecting - It gets quiet noisy actually as the people fill in{SERVICE}: 5/5- One of the best, always someone to be folding your napkin when you go to the restroom or to help you out of the chair. - Staff was very welcoming and took the time to explain the menu to us commoners and give recommendations :p - They even took out my fish and showed me how it smelled before serving it to me all nicely plated {FOOD}: 4/5 ~ Everything was good and plated amazingly, but it was nothing impressive. My family ordered 3 courses off of the a la carte menu (£110 per person). They give you a bunch of entremets in between courses.  [Appetizers] - Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in light bisque with oxalis and wood sorrel: Um it seriously looks like a giant wonton and taste like a wonton. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. The server told me it was one of their signature dishes that had been on the menu for 10+ years.- Pan Fried Sea Scallops: Yum, the sauce was especially lovely. - Cornish Brown and King Crab with radishes, kombu, sesame and oyster emulsion: Similar to a crab salad? I kept thinking it looked like a imitation crab salad from a Japanese restaurant. But it tasted way better and was quite delicious[Entree] - Roast Pigeon: Never tried pidgeon before and it was a intriguing experience. It's definitely something to try! I liked it very much and just taste a bit like duck.- Cotswold Lamb: Definitely worth to get. The meat was so tender and great. - Cornish Turbot: Just amazing, the fish was so buttery and just melted in your mouth. They bring out the fish for you to see before they plate it and smelled wonderful.. - Filet of sea bass: was alright. [Dessert] - Souffle: a MUST get. This was the best dessert by far. The souffle was so poofy and tasted absolutely like a cloud. Just stunning. - Caramelised tarte Tatin of apples with tahitin vanilla ice cream: Just like a giant apple pie honestly. Two people have to order this but I thought it was too much for me to handle half so I just ended up eating the apples lol. - Caramel Milk Chocolate, praline and malt mousse with treacle granola and hazelnut milk: A very beautiful chocolate cake pretty much. Would recommend if you like taking photos of pretty food or chocolate desserts. Overall, the experience was quiet pleasant and nothing less expected from a 3 michelin star restaurant.

You can not find service like this in america. From the pulling out your chair, to a brand new glass/silverware with each plate, to sweeping the crumbs off your table because the pig you are. Every single dish I had was an eye opening shock. The combination of flavors were out of this world. I had a very late reservation so I was able to get a mini tour of the kitchen which makes you feel a little important.

110	5.0	I have to agree with a previous reviewer, performance is the perfect description of the dining experience here.  I was really looking forward to this, I've been a Gordon Ramsay fan for a long time and couldn't leave London without experiencing this for myself.  As a matter of fact, I picked the dates for our visit to London based on the time I could get a reservation!Our reservation was for 6pm, and our plan was to come a little early and start with a cocktail at the bar.  We accomplished this, except Restaurant Gordon Ramsay wasn't open when we arrived, so we found ourselves at Maize Grill also owned by Gordon Ramsay.  That was a great experience too, but back to this review.  Everything at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is very precise. Every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention. The dining room itself is fairly small, it can't be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other, but they do a flawless job.  They don't quite stand by your table, but they politely guide you through the experience.  There were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course.  Even as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours (and I was trying to go slowly!) This is the first Michelin stared restaurant I've ever been to and it sets the bar quite high for any experiences yet to come.	i have to agree with a previous reviewer  performance is the perfect description of the dining experience here   i was really looking forward to this  i ve been a gordon ramsay fan for a long time and couldn t leave london without experiencing this for myself   as a matter of fact  i picked the dates for our visit to london based on the time i could get a reservation our reservation was for 6pm  and our plan was to come a little early and start with a cocktail at the bar   we accomplished this  except restaurant gordon ramsay wasn t open when we arrived  so we found ourselves at maize grill also owned by gordon ramsay   that was a great experience too  but back to this review   everything at restaurant gordon ramsay is very precise  every member of staff gives you a great deal of attention  the dining room itself is fairly small  it can t be easy to maneuver around room without running into each other  but they do a flawless job   they don t quite stand by your table  but they politely guide you through the experience   there were two sommeliers to make recommendations as well as to serve and explain the wine with each course   even as efficient as the staff is our meal lasted three hours  and i was trying to go slowly   this is the first michelin stared restaurant i ve ever been to and it sets the bar quite high for any experiences yet to come 
111	5.0	Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine's Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it's staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. In my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it's Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa's elves could possibly make any better.

112	5.0	Three Michelin stars does not disappoint!My husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and so when we were planning our trip to London we had to stop off and eat at one of his restaurants!We planned the trip very last minute so we were not hopeful of getting a reservation. As everyone says, looks like you have to book months in advance to secure a table, we had weeks lol. I watched the opentable reservations like a hawk and managed to score a last minute lunch reservation for a Thursday!Make sure you leave ample time to make your reservation as we had to call an uber to get over to the Chelsea area as there was a tube strike occurring. We made it on time and were seated at once. The service was impeccable. We were started off with a glass of champagne followed by our choose of butter and breads. There's one with bacon, a pretzel roll, and Irish soda bread. All the breads are delicious so you should have all of them and a lot of them as much as you can!!Then comes the hard part, what to eat? We were really tempted to try the prestige menu which had 7 courses which is what the restaurant was known for but it was lunch time and we wanted to save room for more snacks and food as we explored London a little more. So we went with the 3 course lunch menu and added on wine pairings for our starters and mains. I had the agnolotti with fresh peas as a starter while my husband went for the steak tartare. My agnolotti pasta was soo good. The flavors were very delicate but had a lot of flavor! My husband looked happy with his steak tartare as well.For the mains, I ordered the Cornish cod while my husband ordered the poussin. I loved all the flavors of the cod and loved the shiitake mushrooms. The poussin was cooked very well as well.The funest part was the desserts. Not only were our desserts delicious, we got extra desserts as well! The white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect! My favorite of the extra dessert with the peanut butter brittle. Soo good.Yes it's worth the money to come here! The service and food here are all top notch! I'll be watching the dinner reservations on opentable to come back for the prestige menu!!!	three michelin stars does not disappoint my husband is a huge gordon ramsay fan and so when we were planning our trip to london we had to stop off and eat at one of his restaurants we planned the trip very last minute so we were not hopeful of getting a reservation  as everyone says  looks like you have to book months in advance to secure a table  we had weeks lol  i watched the opentable reservations like a hawk and managed to score a last minute lunch reservation for a thursday make sure you leave ample time to make your reservation as we had to call an uber to get over to the chelsea area as there was a tube strike occurring  we made it on time and were seated at once  the service was impeccable  we were started off with a glass of champagne followed by our choose of butter and breads  there s one with bacon  a pretzel roll  and irish soda bread  all the breads are delicious so you should have all of them and a lot of them as much as you can  then comes the hard part  what to eat  we were really tempted to try the prestige menu which had 7 courses which is what the restaurant was known for but it was lunch time and we wanted to save room for more snacks and food as we explored london a little more  so we went with the 3 course lunch menu and added on wine pairings for our starters and mains  i had the agnolotti with fresh peas as a starter while my husband went for the steak tartare  my agnolotti pasta was soo good  the flavors were very delicate but had a lot of flavor  my husband looked happy with his steak tartare as well for the mains  i ordered the cornish cod while my husband ordered the poussin  i loved all the flavors of the cod and loved the shiitake mushrooms  the poussin was cooked very well as well the funest part was the desserts  not only were our desserts delicious  we got extra desserts as well  the white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls were served in a tin with dry ice so that was a fun effect  my favorite of the extra dessert with the peanut butter brittle  soo good yes it s worth the money to come here  the service and food here are all top notch  i ll be watching the dinner reservations on opentable to come back for the prestige menu   
113	3.0	As many have mentioned, the restaurant is elegant with great service but unfortunately I was not super impressed with the food. I think my expectation was too high. We got the 7 courses menu. Pros: I thought the portions were just right. Great service! - but with one oops at the end by the biller. For some reason, she was unable to comprehend splitting the bill by 1/3 and 2/3. It took 3 tries to get it right. The food overall looked good and tasted decent. This was by far the most expensive chef choice I've tried so far likely because the pound is so expensive. For some reason, the food just did have enough wow factor for me. Definitely not bad food though. My favorite were the cucumber sorbet mixed in the mint, lemon verbena and burnet salad. Very creative and tasted refreshing. We also had:Foie Gras with green apples, turnips watercress and smoked duck. - well prepared but did not leave a lasting memory in my palate. Lobster Ravioli - somewhat bland for my taste. Halibut with King Crab and lime, Cauliflower Cous-Cous and Ras el hangout infused broth - The broth compliment the halibut really well. The flavor was fresh. The fish was cook to perfection. The dish was also very pretty. I enjoyed this dish a lot. Cotswold Lamb with vegetable  Bresse pigeon- both decent but not memorable.Good one time experience.	as many have mentioned  the restaurant is elegant with great service but unfortunately i was not super impressed with the food  i think my expectation was too high  we got the 7 courses menu  pros  i thought the portions were just right  great service    but with one oops at the end by the biller  for some reason  she was unable to comprehend splitting the bill by 1 3 and 2 3  it took 3 tries to get it right  the food overall looked good and tasted decent  this was by far the most expensive chef choice i ve tried so far likely because the pound is so expensive  for some reason  the food just did have enough wow factor for me  definitely not bad food though  my favorite were the cucumber sorbet mixed in the mint  lemon verbena and burnet salad  very creative and tasted refreshing  we also had foie gras with green apples  turnips watercress and smoked duck    well prepared but did not leave a lasting memory in my palate  lobster ravioli   somewhat bland for my taste  halibut with king crab and lime  cauliflower cous cous and ras el hangout infused broth   the broth compliment the halibut really well  the flavor was fresh  the fish was cook to perfection  the dish was also very pretty  i enjoyed this dish a lot  cotswold lamb with vegetable  bresse pigeon  both decent but not memorable good one time experience 
114	5.0	Once we arrived in town we went to our hotel dropped off our bagged and took a Uber straight there.  We had the last reservation time for the afternoon service and you could not tell that it was the end of service.  We were treated like anyone else without any rush or hurry.  Service was excellent and white gloved.  Waiters, waitresses and head of the house was very informative, friendly and very knowledgeable of their food.   We had their seasonal menu.  Presentation of each course was absolutely a work of art! It broke my heart to eat them but once I took the first bite my heart mended and was filled with love and warmth of the chief's hard work.  Being the last patron in the dinning room, we were invited by the manager to take a tour of the kitchen.  WOW! We were shocked on how many chef's were in there.  From entrees, pastry, and dishware section, it was such a delight to go into the kitchen and to be shown around.  Too bad that we didn't run into Gordon Ramsey but we were told that he does stop by often to cook and run service.  The experience was a delight and I am truly honored to have eaten here.	once we arrived in town we went to our hotel dropped off our bagged and took a uber straight there   we had the last reservation time for the afternoon service and you could not tell that it was the end of service   we were treated like anyone else without any rush or hurry   service was excellent and white gloved   waiters  waitresses and head of the house was very informative  friendly and very knowledgeable of their food    we had their seasonal menu   presentation of each course was absolutely a work of art  it broke my heart to eat them but once i took the first bite my heart mended and was filled with love and warmth of the chief s hard work   being the last patron in the dinning room  we were invited by the manager to take a tour of the kitchen   wow  we were shocked on how many chef s were in there   from entrees  pastry  and dishware section  it was such a delight to go into the kitchen and to be shown around   too bad that we didn t run into gordon ramsey but we were told that he does stop by often to cook and run service   the experience was a delight and i am truly honored to have eaten here 
115	5.0	"Gordon Ramsay creates the most unsurpassed French cuisine in London's culinary scene.For some, the word ""London"" spawns images of famous monuments like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. Others imagine the cabbies, fashion, and pub scene. But hardly anyone can attest that London is known for delicious food. The statement itself is an oxymoron.Until you try Gordon Ramsay's in Chelsea.I have been a huge GR fan since the first season of Hell's Kitchen. Attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award-winning sauces. And even though Gordon may have his anger management issues on the show, the man can cook. Then I realized, what am I waiting for?? I should just come to him! So I did...But don't take my word for it. Ask Michelin. Gordon Ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious Michelin Stars, the highest accolade one can receive by the Michelin brothers. The Michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy-dandy manual for those traveling within Europe for reliable gas stations, eateries, and service tips. In 1933, it launched its Red Guide that inspected restaurants all around Europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards. The inspectors to this day are anonymous (even the parents don't know their line of work), and the secret diners are funded by the Michelin company, not the restaurant. The grading scale is 1 to 3 stars: One being good in its category, two being excellent and worth a detour, and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself. The Michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date, less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3-star honor.With that said, I was beyond excited to try this place. I had booked my reservation at least four months before I set foot in London. Service was spot-on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor. He grew up in Dijon (France) and was extremely passionate about the menu. My bf and I ordered the Prestige Menu and the Seasonal Inspirations Course. Each seven-course dish was impeccably crafted and presented. The poached lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor. My foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears. The next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that I could have nibbled on the entire evening. After the soup, cheese and fruit course, we were pretty stuffed. But lo and behold, the desserts shined brightest for us. One was a Milk Chocolate Truffle Tree. This literally was a silver tree stand with truffle-infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights. Like Ancient Romans plucking grapes off one-by-one, we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs. The second dessert was a White Chocolate and Strawberry Ice Cream platter on dry ice. As if that wasn't enough, the best was yet to come.The most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted ""behind the scenes"" to the kitchen where all the magic happens. When the manager found out that we had visited all the way from Hawaii, they asked if we'd like to see the chefs at work. Unfortunately, Chef Gordon himself was in New York but Chef Patron Clare Smyth (Chef of the Year winner by UK Food Guide and the only female UK Chef to win 3 Michelin Stars) was leading the team, mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out. Their kitchen was absolutely spotless, and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience's ears.I still remember the tray of mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room, poised in a champagne flute and glass straw. Chef Clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision. This experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our European getaways. I look forward to meeting Chef Gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories."	gordon ramsay creates the most unsurpassed french cuisine in london s culinary scene for some  the word  london  spawns images of famous monuments like big ben  the london eye  and buckingham palace  others imagine the cabbies  fashion  and pub scene  but hardly anyone can attest that london is known for delicious food  the statement itself is an oxymoron until you try gordon ramsay s in chelsea i have been a huge gr fan since the first season of hell s kitchen  attending a live dinner service is on my bucket list just to try a dollop of his award winning sauces  and even though gordon may have his anger management issues on the show  the man can cook  then i realized  what am i waiting for   i should just come to him  so i did   but don t take my word for it  ask michelin  gordon ramsay is a recipient of three prestigious michelin stars  the highest accolade one can receive by the michelin brothers  the michelin guide began in 1900 as a handy dandy manual for those traveling within europe for reliable gas stations  eateries  and service tips  in 1933  it launched its red guide that inspected restaurants all around europe under the highest caliber of secrecy and standards  the inspectors to this day are anonymous  even the parents don t know their line of work   and the secret diners are funded by the michelin company  not the restaurant  the grading scale is 1 to 3 stars  one being good in its category  two being excellent and worth a detour  and three being exceptional and worth a journey in itself  the michelin grading system has received worldwide respect and to date  less than 100 restaurants around the globe have been bequeathed with the 3 star honor with that said  i was beyond excited to try this place  i had booked my reservation at least four months before i set foot in london  service was spot on with our waiter epitomizing the perfect blend of cordialness and humor  he grew up in dijon  france  and was extremely passionate about the menu  my bf and i ordered the prestige menu and the seasonal inspirations course  each seven course dish was impeccably crafted and presented  the poached lobster  langoustine and salmon ravioli held remarkable flavor  my foie gras was embedded with the sweet juice of duck confit and pickled pears  the next protein courses were the halibut and suckling pig with crispy skin that i could have nibbled on the entire evening  after the soup  cheese and fruit course  we were pretty stuffed  but lo and behold  the desserts shined brightest for us  one was a milk chocolate truffle tree  this literally was a silver tree stand with truffle infused chocolates awaiting our degustation delights  like ancient romans plucking grapes off one by one  we fed each other these signatures confections with smiles and laughs  the second dessert was a white chocolate and strawberry ice cream platter on dry ice  as if that wasn t enough  the best was yet to come the most memorable part of this experience was being secretly escorted  behind the scenes  to the kitchen where all the magic happens  when the manager found out that we had visited all the way from hawaii  they asked if we d like to see the chefs at work  unfortunately  chef gordon himself was in new york but chef patron clare smyth  chef of the year winner by uk food guide and the only female uk chef to win 3 michelin stars  was leading the team  mastering the finishing touches on every dish sent out  their kitchen was absolutely spotless  and every member of the kitchen was working harmoniously like instruments perfecting the tunes before it hit the audience s ears i still remember the tray of mango  jasmine and passion fruit soup about to be served to the dining room  poised in a champagne flute and glass straw  chef clare stopped the waiter and placed a drop of sugar water on the end of each straw to ensure it was perfectly presented in taste and vision  this experience took my breath away and we talk about it every so often when we relive our european getaways  i look forward to meeting chef gordon in person one day to express my gratitude to him and his staff for a lifetime of delicious memories

117	5.0	This was a fantastic dining experience on my recent honeymoon. We booked a table months in advance and it did not disappoint. I will say that the restaurant was smaller than I thought it was.My husband and I both had the menu prestige. I was wonderfully surprised when my husband actually liked the foie gras! (He tries to be adventurous.) His favorite was the lobster and langosteen ravioli and mine was too. The lemon sorbet dessert was also to die for!The service here is top notch and I would have expected nothing less. The bathrooms here are unisex, which is unexpected. So the moment you stand up, there's always someone who spots you and walks to you the bathroom. Bread plates were always full and glasses were too. The staff were definitely not sleeping on the job!Lastly, we got to tour the kitchen! The Matre'D was very nice and brought us in. Great touch to the perfect night!	this was a fantastic dining experience on my recent honeymoon  we booked a table months in advance and it did not disappoint  i will say that the restaurant was smaller than i thought it was my husband and i both had the menu prestige  i was wonderfully surprised when my husband actually liked the foie gras   he tries to be adventurous   his favorite was the lobster and langosteen ravioli and mine was too  the lemon sorbet dessert was also to die for the service here is top notch and i would have expected nothing less  the bathrooms here are unisex  which is unexpected  so the moment you stand up  there s always someone who spots you and walks to you the bathroom  bread plates were always full and glasses were too  the staff were definitely not sleeping on the job lastly  we got to tour the kitchen  the matre d was very nice and brought us in  great touch to the perfect night

119	3.0	Without question, the food here was great. And I say great, not AMAZING the way a three Michelin starred restaurant should be. They say that you should go out of your way and even travel to a country for a three star restaurant, but this food was more on par with the one stars I've been too. In fact, my favorite part of the meal was the dessert, a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet. The main, roast venison, was quite well-prepared but nothing to write home about. It was not impressive. The service, too, was quite rude. My group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients, as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from America. We were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet, but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well. What's more, our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans, which is totally acceptable given their dress code, but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change. Additionally, the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew... if we didn't know, would we be there ordering it? Overall quite disappointed by the incongruence between price and taste as well as the rudeness of the service.	without question  the food here was great  and i say great  not amazing the way a three michelin starred restaurant should be  they say that you should go out of your way and even travel to a country for a three star restaurant  but this food was more on par with the one stars i ve been too  in fact  my favorite part of the meal was the dessert  a grapefruit custard with mascarpone sorbet  the main  roast venison  was quite well prepared but nothing to write home about  it was not impressive  the service  too  was quite rude  my group of 6 was not treated the same as the other clients  as we were obviously half the age as everyone and were from america  we were not seated immediately because our last party member was not there yet  but another group after us was seated immediately even though they said they were waiting for someone as well  what s more  our friend was made to change into leggings from her jeans  which is totally acceptable given their dress code  but then we saw another woman with shorts on who had not been made to change  additionally  the host kept on asking us if we knew what tartare and venison were and asked us to tell him what it was just to make sure we knew    if we didn t know  would we be there ordering it  overall quite disappointed by the incongruence between price and taste as well as the rudeness of the service 
120	5.0	"The easiest five-star given.The service was impeccable (be forewarned, lots of superlative adjective will be thrown out in this review). From the greetings to the last gesture when we were leaving, the service was not too much or on your face. The maitre d, knowing we were tourist, chatted with us a bit, sharing his story too. It was a nice touch. My glass of water was never empty for more than 8 seconds, it was that attentive. All were professional and friendly, definitely the true definition of dining service. The food was too perfect, every single bite was memorable and if only I could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again. We ordered the 3 course dinner menu, and let me tell you outright, the amuse bouche were as good, and some were even better than the 3 course menu. My personal favorite is this white egg, potato soup and truffle serve in an egg shell. I did not know it was a potato until I asked (I guess I missed their explanation at the start, probably admiring their accent too much). And also this strawberry ice cream dessert something. I had the lobster ravioli for appetizer and it was super juicy and easily be my second favorite. My friend ordered the foie gras. We ordered pigeon and suckling pig for entree and then we opted for the all-dessert menu. I would run out of vocabulary to describe all the food here and will sound repetitive because every description will entail the word ""excellent, perfect, outstanding, impeccable, splendid and unmatched"". A true and special dining experience."	the easiest five star given the service was impeccable  be forewarned  lots of superlative adjective will be thrown out in this review   from the greetings to the last gesture when we were leaving  the service was not too much or on your face  the maitre d  knowing we were tourist  chatted with us a bit  sharing his story too  it was a nice touch  my glass of water was never empty for more than 8 seconds  it was that attentive  all were professional and friendly  definitely the true definition of dining service  the food was too perfect  every single bite was memorable and if only i could keep the sensation in a jar and savor the moment again and again  we ordered the 3 course dinner menu  and let me tell you outright  the amuse bouche were as good  and some were even better than the 3 course menu  my personal favorite is this white egg  potato soup and truffle serve in an egg shell  i did not know it was a potato until i asked  i guess i missed their explanation at the start  probably admiring their accent too much   and also this strawberry ice cream dessert something  i had the lobster ravioli for appetizer and it was super juicy and easily be my second favorite  my friend ordered the foie gras  we ordered pigeon and suckling pig for entree and then we opted for the all dessert menu  i would run out of vocabulary to describe all the food here and will sound repetitive because every description will entail the word  excellent  perfect  outstanding  impeccable  splendid and unmatched   a true and special dining experience

122	3.0	"Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is a 3 Michelin Starred Restaurant in a quiet area of London. I unfortunately made the same mistake of booking a very late reservation (the only one available a few weeks ago) and sure enough, this was not as great of an overall experience as I'd hoped. Made the same mistake of booking 9:30 PM reservations at three other NYC 3 Michelin Star restaurants (Le Bernadin, Jean Georges and Daniel before it lost a star) and all of them were just OK to me - nothing special whatsoever. You would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but I'm finding that this just isn't the case consistently. When it comes to high end ""French"" restaurants, you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world. Other Yelpers had a great experience but again, I'm assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely. My girlfriend and I entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room. Most of the tables were filled but I can presume that since it was already 9:30 PM, some diners already finished their dinner.You have the option of an a la carte, a traditional Prestige menu or a ""Seasonal Inspiration"" menu. What is cool is that you aren't obligated to order one menu per table so my girlfriend requested the Prestige and I did the Seasonal.The Seasonal one:1) Poached Langoustine with caviar and celery - Surprisingly very fishy and did not taste at all fresh. Did not finish.2) Linguine with black truffle and mushroom - Excellent!!3) Dover sole - Another fishy flavor unfortunately. Did not finish.4) Roasted loin of Highland Venison - The gamiest venison I've ever eaten at any Michelin Star restaurant.5) Vacherin Fondue - So good!!!! A very great flavor on a traditional cheese fondue.6) Lime Sorbet with shiso and coconut mousse - Pretty good but not memorable7) Clementine Parfait with orange mint and lemon thyme - Pretty good but not memorableThe Prestige menu:1) Pressed Foie Gras with green apples, turnips, watercress and smoked duck - Enjoyed2) Ravioli with lobster, langoustine, salmon, oxalis and wood sorrel - Again felt was fishy but she enjoyed3) Poached isle of Gigha halibut - Alright but not memorable4) Roast pigeon with fennel, lavender, honey and blood orange - GAMEY5) Soup with mango, jasmine and passion fruit - Good6) Sorbet with green apple, chamomile and marigold - Alright but not memorable7) Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt - Very goodThey ended the meal with pretty cool white chocolates (I believe) that came out in a very smokey box. Service was impeccable for sure. The food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 Star around the world - the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat (not cooked all that well).Also not a fan that they didn't leave us with any takeaway, not even a takeaway menu of the experience. :( DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BOOKING LATE NIGHT RESERVATIONS!!"	restaurant gordon ramsay is a 3 michelin starred restaurant in a quiet area of london  i unfortunately made the same mistake of booking a very late reservation  the only one available a few weeks ago  and sure enough  this was not as great of an overall experience as i d hoped  made the same mistake of booking 9 30 pm reservations at three other nyc 3 michelin star restaurants  le bernadin  jean georges and daniel before it lost a star  and all of them were just ok to me   nothing special whatsoever  you would think that a restaurant is responsible for quality no matter what the time but i m finding that this just isn t the case consistently  when it comes to high end  french  restaurants  you hold a very high standard to how every dish is prepared and that the flavors of the courses are that which you only find at that restaurant in the entire world  other yelpers had a great experience but again  i m assuming that the late reservation impacted our total experience completely  my girlfriend and i entered and were walked to our table in the very minimalistic yet cozy dining room  most of the tables were filled but i can presume that since it was already 9 30 pm  some diners already finished their dinner you have the option of an a la carte  a traditional prestige menu or a  seasonal inspiration  menu  what is cool is that you aren t obligated to order one menu per table so my girlfriend requested the prestige and i did the seasonal the seasonal one 1  poached langoustine with caviar and celery   surprisingly very fishy and did not taste at all fresh  did not finish 2  linguine with black truffle and mushroom   excellent  3  dover sole   another fishy flavor unfortunately  did not finish 4  roasted loin of highland venison   the gamiest venison i ve ever eaten at any michelin star restaurant 5  vacherin fondue   so good     a very great flavor on a traditional cheese fondue 6  lime sorbet with shiso and coconut mousse   pretty good but not memorable7  clementine parfait with orange mint and lemon thyme   pretty good but not memorablethe prestige menu 1  pressed foie gras with green apples  turnips  watercress and smoked duck   enjoyed2  ravioli with lobster  langoustine  salmon  oxalis and wood sorrel   again felt was fishy but she enjoyed3  poached isle of gigha halibut   alright but not memorable4  roast pigeon with fennel  lavender  honey and blood orange   gamey5  soup with mango  jasmine and passion fruit   good6  sorbet with green apple  chamomile and marigold   alright but not memorable7  lemonade parfait with honey  bergamot and sheep s milk yoghurt   very goodthey ended the meal with pretty cool white chocolates  i believe  that came out in a very smokey box  service was impeccable for sure  the food and experience were just not my taste compared to every other 3 star around the world   the fish were fishy tasting and the meats were gamey and difficult to cut and eat  not cooked all that well  also not a fan that they didn t leave us with any takeaway  not even a takeaway menu of the experience     do not make the mistake of booking late night reservations  
123	5.0	Easily the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. The whole experience is exactly what you'd expect from a three Michelin star establishment.The setting is beautiful and with only only 12 or so tables very exclusive so book well ahead. Chef Patron Clare Smythe is absolutely brilliant at the helm, her dishes interesting, delicious and beautifully presented. The Maître D' Jean Claude is extremely attentive, knows every dish, and gives you the full explanation upon its arrival. The staff are excellent, always there when you need them, while never hovering or interrupting. All of the staff make you feel extremely welcome. Jean Claude asked if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the Chef before we left which we did. Clare was also very welcoming. The kitchen was very well organized, and probably the cleanest I've ever seen.I had the pressed foie gras, braised confit and roasted Herdwick lamb and Lemon soufflé. The wine selection is excellent and they add nice touches between courses of little complementary tasting dishes from the Chef. One of which after desert and before coffee were handmade ice cream sweets in white chocolate shells served in liquid nitrogen. The prices are very reasonable for the experience you get and well worth paying. I'll definitely be back.	easily the best restaurant i ve ever had the pleasure of eating at  the whole experience is exactly what you d expect from a three michelin star establishment the setting is beautiful and with only only 12 or so tables very exclusive so book well ahead  chef patron clare smythe is absolutely brilliant at the helm  her dishes interesting  delicious and beautifully presented  the ma tre d  jean claude is extremely attentive  knows every dish  and gives you the full explanation upon its arrival  the staff are excellent  always there when you need them  while never hovering or interrupting  all of the staff make you feel extremely welcome  jean claude asked if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the chef before we left which we did  clare was also very welcoming  the kitchen was very well organized  and probably the cleanest i ve ever seen i had the pressed foie gras  braised confit and roasted herdwick lamb and lemon souffl   the wine selection is excellent and they add nice touches between courses of little complementary tasting dishes from the chef  one of which after desert and before coffee were handmade ice cream sweets in white chocolate shells served in liquid nitrogen  the prices are very reasonable for the experience you get and well worth paying  i ll definitely be back

I came in for lunch because all the dinner reservations were booked in advance, but either way, you can still order the 9 course meal during the lunch hours too.Unfortunately, I had another 9 course meal waiting for me that evening so I just settled with their 3 course lunch menu. It was cheaper too at only  £45. And even with the 3 course meal, it still fills you up. Because you actually get more than 3 courses. It just keeps coming and coming.I was even entertained by Jean-Claude, the maitre d' of Gordon Ramsay who gave me a book to read while I was waiting for my meal. And he also gave me a tour of the kitchen and got my menu signed by Clare Smith, the head chef of Gordon Ramsay.I realize now why dinner reservations book up so quick. I really enjoyed my time here and when I come back to London, I'll make it a top priority to come back and this time to try out their ""Menu Prestige.""

128	5.0	My wife and I are so lucky to have had this experience.  We had the perfect lunch.  On a scale of 1 to 5, it was a solid 10!We were greeted warmly and taken to a great table in a relatively small restaurant--and a place they do not strive to turn their tables.Maitre d' Jean Claude immediately came to our table.  He was the perfect host to us and the other diners at this sold out service.Head Sommelier Jan was flawless as he helped Nancy select a wine that was just right for her.  She sampled several as he narrowed down to the target wine.  It must have been over the top, as she had 4 glasses of it.Words cannot describe the seasonal tasting menu prepared by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.  The food was delicious and plated so beautifully.  This was their first day back following a long Christmas holiday.  She and her staff did not miss a beat.The manager for the front of the house left about 6 months ago and his assistant has been promoted to manager.  He was absolutely delightful and his staff took excellent care of us all day.On a sad/happy note--Chef Smyth will soon be moving on to captain her own restaurant.  We we fortunate enough to be able to catch her for a brief moment to wish her well and assure her that we would find and support her new endeavor.Any who follows Chef Ramsay must see how he supports women in their efforts to achieve greatness.  This is a prime example of just that.  I hope Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In organization is taking note and giving credit to this fine man and great mentor.	my wife and i are so lucky to have had this experience   we had the perfect lunch   on a scale of 1 to 5  it was a solid 10 we were greeted warmly and taken to a great table in a relatively small restaurant  and a place they do not strive to turn their tables maitre d  jean claude immediately came to our table   he was the perfect host to us and the other diners at this sold out service head sommelier jan was flawless as he helped nancy select a wine that was just right for her   she sampled several as he narrowed down to the target wine   it must have been over the top  as she had 4 glasses of it words cannot describe the seasonal tasting menu prepared by chef patron clare smyth   the food was delicious and plated so beautifully   this was their first day back following a long christmas holiday   she and her staff did not miss a beat the manager for the front of the house left about 6 months ago and his assistant has been promoted to manager   he was absolutely delightful and his staff took excellent care of us all day on a sad happy note  chef smyth will soon be moving on to captain her own restaurant   we we fortunate enough to be able to catch her for a brief moment to wish her well and assure her that we would find and support her new endeavor any who follows chef ramsay must see how he supports women in their efforts to achieve greatness   this is a prime example of just that   i hope sheryl sandberg s lean in organization is taking note and giving credit to this fine man and great mentor 
129	4.0	One expensive meal. Had the menu prestige with all oh chefs original masterpiece.  The sequence on how the food was served was great it really gave good balance. There are dishes that are not that good, but one can only satisfies someone so much.  The king crab halibut was bomb the aroma of the broth that was poured on top of it gave it a very balance feel, I'm not big cooked fish fan...I'm not sure if they cooked the halibut more mushy to blend with the consistency of the king crab. Main course was the lamb served in 5 ways (can be a bit gamey for some) but prepared right in my opinion with the different cuts. Cucumber sorbet was bomb. Overall the service was the best I've had out of all the Michelin star chef choice restaurants. At the end of the meal even visited the kitchen. If only the bill clerk knows her math than I would say the service is as flawless as it can be	one expensive meal  had the menu prestige with all oh chefs original masterpiece   the sequence on how the food was served was great it really gave good balance  there are dishes that are not that good  but one can only satisfies someone so much   the king crab halibut was bomb the aroma of the broth that was poured on top of it gave it a very balance feel  i m not big cooked fish fan   i m not sure if they cooked the halibut more mushy to blend with the consistency of the king crab  main course was the lamb served in 5 ways  can be a bit gamey for some  but prepared right in my opinion with the different cuts  cucumber sorbet was bomb  overall the service was the best i ve had out of all the michelin star chef choice restaurants  at the end of the meal even visited the kitchen  if only the bill clerk knows her math than i would say the service is as flawless as it can be

There are two three michelin star in London: 1. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay 2. Fat Duck. This is the only three michelin star restaurant in London at the moment since the ""Fat Duck"" has been closed down for its renovation.

When you make a reservation they take your credit card right away and warn you that they will charge you if you don't show up (100 GBP per person?). The service staff is phenomenal, super nice and super attentive all the time (3-michelin star alright). Food was also very good but to be honest I had better in places with fewer michelin starts (Kitchen W8). All in all, we had a very pleasant evening but expected more for what we paid.	went to gordon ramsay to celebrate my birthday  when you make a reservation they take your credit card right away and warn you that they will charge you if you don t show up  100 gbp per person    the service staff is phenomenal  super nice and super attentive all the time  3 michelin star alright   food was also very good but to be honest i had better in places with fewer michelin starts  kitchen w8   all in all  we had a very pleasant evening but expected more for what we paid

133	4.0	"Everybody knows it, lovers and haters. In two words, Gordon Ramsay. And this is his flagship restaurant. Here you do not dine out, this is a food experience, this is a culinary trip. You don't get here by chance, and every single dish, every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time. But yet, small imperfections caused the lack of the ""top quality seal"" approval (yes we have a seal!) from me and my lovely lady.As soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others. The cure for details is maniacal, from the door to the tables. But here we also started to notice the first issues: the place is quite small, as it should be, but it's rather busy: we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall, but a couple in front of us (really, at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between) was right in the middle of the hall, something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall. It seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit, and that's a serious error.But as we said, the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy. Quite minimalistic in the style, it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love. Incredible.The waiters were nice and warming, very accommodating (even too much perhaps, given that we were on a romantic dinner) and they spoke to us in several languages. But from the other side, some of the waiters lacked in appearance, with a wrong make up messed-up hairs. Something you don't want to find in a three stars restaurant.But then, let's speak about the main reason we get there, the food! First time we came here, we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for, so here we go with the tasting menu. We chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special, and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine, candle, decanter and so on.At first I prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described, but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me. Hence, I just want to speak to you about two dishes, my personal favourite ones.The first one is a dish I waited for years: ""Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon"". Wow. Already the name is something to blow up your mind, putting together the sweetness of the lobster, the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon. And the result is so good it can't be described, you need to taste it. Served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle, it's just one of the best things I ever tasted in my life. A dish so delicious they should name a star with its name.The second one is another famous masterpiece for Gordon Ramsay restaurant: Isle of Gigha halibut with Atlantic King crab, finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth.Now, let's start from the beginning: presentation is ridiculously perfect: the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top, and they proceed to serve the broth (at room temperature) all around the halibut (like they do with the bisque and the ravioli). The difference is that the broth is liquid, transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting. A wonderful painting, relaxing and intriguing. And the broth, oh my the broth. Incredible, powerful, with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other, it's like a Kandinsky frame on your mouth (yes keep going with art paragons!), you can always feel something different and something new, evolving and moving, but the big picture, the big screen is always appealing and entertaining. This dish alone deserves a dinner here. Full stop. If you don't like such a perfect combination of taste, smell, sight I don't even want to be a friend of yours on yelp. And I'm serious.It's painful not to speak about every other dish, as every single plate on our table was a piece of art, even the ones we didn't like, but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized. It's amazing.Unfortunately, as every adventure, we had to end our trip. We started good, we had some initial issues, we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely. All in all it's a wonderful dining experience, but because of some strange errors I found it does not deserves the 5 stars. Not now, not this time."	everybody knows it  lovers and haters  in two words  gordon ramsay  and this is his flagship restaurant  here you do not dine out  this is a food experience  this is a culinary trip  you don t get here by chance  and every single dish  every single instant will be stuck in your mind for a long time  but yet  small imperfections caused the lack of the  top quality seal  approval  yes we have a seal   from me and my lovely lady as soon as we entered here we got the feeling this was a place like no others  the cure for details is maniacal  from the door to the tables  but here we also started to notice the first issues  the place is quite small  as it should be  but it s rather busy  we were lucky in receiving a table on the wall  but a couple in front of us  really  at less than 1 m with the corridor for waiters in between  was right in the middle of the hall  something completely uncomfortable giving the amount of tables on the wall  it seemed to me they really pushed their capacity over the limit  and that s a serious error but as we said  the decor both of the place and on the wall is incredibly refined and classy  quite minimalistic in the style  it has several little classy touches both me and my lady love  incredible the waiters were nice and warming  very accommodating  even too much perhaps  given that we were on a romantic dinner  and they spoke to us in several languages  but from the other side  some of the waiters lacked in appearance  with a wrong make up messed up hairs  something you don t want to find in a three stars restaurant but then  let s speak about the main reason we get there  the food  first time we came here  we wanted to try all the classical dishes the restaurant is acclaimed for  so here we go with the tasting menu  we chose a half bottle in order to get something a little bit more special  and we received the service we expected considering the age and the caliber of the wine  candle  decanter and so on at first i prepared an awesome review with every single dish carefully described  but the maximum size of 5000 words on yelp is really too much for me  hence  i just want to speak to you about two dishes  my personal favourite ones the first one is a dish i waited for years   ravioli of lobster  langoustine and salmon   wow  already the name is something to blow up your mind  putting together the sweetness of the lobster  the delicacy of the langoustine and the heavy and powerful taste of salmon  and the result is so good it can t be described  you need to taste it  served with a delicious bisque with sorrel giving that extra citric needle  it s just one of the best things i ever tasted in my life  a dish so delicious they should name a star with its name the second one is another famous masterpiece for gordon ramsay restaurant  isle of gigha halibut with atlantic king crab  finger lime and ras el hanout infused broth now  let s start from the beginning  presentation is ridiculously perfect  the dish comes with the halibut and the crab on top  and they proceed to serve the broth  at room temperature  all around the halibut  like they do with the bisque and the ravioli   the difference is that the broth is liquid  transparent and with flower petals and the composition of the dish rapidly becomes a painting  a wonderful painting  relaxing and intriguing  and the broth  oh my the broth  incredible  powerful  with 4 thousands flavor all balanced between each other  it s like a kandinsky frame on your mouth  yes keep going with art paragons    you can always feel something different and something new  evolving and moving  but the big picture  the big screen is always appealing and entertaining  this dish alone deserves a dinner here  full stop  if you don t like such a perfect combination of taste  smell  sight i don t even want to be a friend of yours on yelp  and i m serious it s painful not to speak about every other dish  as every single plate on our table was a piece of art  even the ones we didn t like  but each one had a history and was perfectly concepted and realized  it s amazing unfortunately  as every adventure  we had to end our trip  we started good  we had some initial issues  we had some awesome surprise and we reached home safely  all in all it s a wonderful dining experience  but because of some strange errors i found it does not deserves the 5 stars  not now  not this time 
134	4.0	"Being a foodie, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is definitely on my bucket list. Having gone to most of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in the Bay Area (aside from Manresa at the time of writing), I was looking forward to trying out this place on my visit to London. We came during lunch time (they open their reservation MONTHS in advance, and at 4 months before, I was only able to grab lunch spots). Their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner, in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time. My boyfriend and I went a la carte during our meal. As always, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have. I didn't realized how big their portion sizes are, so by the time dessert came, I was already way too full. I got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree. They're definitely more of a ""traditional"" fine cuisine place. So if you're into traditional French cuisine such as The French Laundry, this is your place. My boyfriend and I prefer more adventurous takes on cuisine (our favorite is Benu in SF), so the food here is a bit boring. But don't get me wrong, the food was amazing and perfectly prepared!"	being a foodie  restaurant gordon ramsay is definitely on my bucket list  having gone to most of the 3 michelin star restaurants in the bay area  aside from manresa at the time of writing   i was looking forward to trying out this place on my visit to london  we came during lunch time  they open their reservation months in advance  and at 4 months before  i was only able to grab lunch spots   their menu availability is the same for lunch and dinner  in addition to a lunch special menu that they only offer during lunch time  my boyfriend and i went a la carte during our meal  as always  my eyes were bigger than my stomach  and i decided to go with the option that lets you try every dessert they have  i didn t realized how big their portion sizes are  so by the time dessert came  i was already way too full  i got the foie gras for appetizer and fish for entree  they re definitely more of a  traditional  fine cuisine place  so if you re into traditional french cuisine such as the french laundry  this is your place  my boyfriend and i prefer more adventurous takes on cuisine  our favorite is benu in sf   so the food here is a bit boring  but don t get me wrong  the food was amazing and perfectly prepared 
135	5.0	I loved Gordon Ramsay, even though I was seated next to a loud Chinese party of ten. If it weren't for the attentive service, that could potentially have ruined my night. The restaurant is very intimate, so you'll see how that could have been distracting. I was stuffed by the end of the Seasonal Inspiration Menu. The server was extra generous with the truffles, but I can't say I preferred the overall experience to Petrus, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Try both and see for yourself!	i loved gordon ramsay  even though i was seated next to a loud chinese party of ten  if it weren t for the attentive service  that could potentially have ruined my night  the restaurant is very intimate  so you ll see how that could have been distracting  i was stuffed by the end of the seasonal inspiration menu  the server was extra generous with the truffles  but i can t say i preferred the overall experience to petrus  which i thoroughly enjoyed  try both and see for yourself

137	5.0	Outstanding in every respect. As we were visiting from the USA, I had made reservations online for the 4 of us and the restaurant called the week before to confirm the time. It was nice to speak someone prior to our arrival and let them know how much we were looking forward to the meal. I knew it was going to be expensive and wondered if it would live up to the expectations and it way exceeded them. Jean-Claude the maître de was phenomenal. The service was impeccable, he regularly checked back on us without being intrusive. The other wait staff were polished and smooth throughout the service.The food was the best that I have ever had, every course beautifully presented. The taste out of this world, the menu descriptions do not do justice to the taste on your tongue.At the end we were shown the kitchen; smaller than I expected and was able to thank Claire for a most wonderful experience.I think it speaks volumes that although Gordon is hardly ever there, his high standards are maintained.Once in a lifetime experience, wish I could do it again	outstanding in every respect  as we were visiting from the usa  i had made reservations online for the 4 of us and the restaurant called the week before to confirm the time  it was nice to speak someone prior to our arrival and let them know how much we were looking forward to the meal  i knew it was going to be expensive and wondered if it would live up to the expectations and it way exceeded them  jean claude the ma tre de was phenomenal  the service was impeccable  he regularly checked back on us without being intrusive  the other wait staff were polished and smooth throughout the service the food was the best that i have ever had  every course beautifully presented  the taste out of this world  the menu descriptions do not do justice to the taste on your tongue at the end we were shown the kitchen  smaller than i expected and was able to thank claire for a most wonderful experience i think it speaks volumes that although gordon is hardly ever there  his high standards are maintained once in a lifetime experience  wish i could do it again
138	5.0	"I was so anticipating this visit as one of the highlights of my London trip that I was worried I would end up disappointed. Not so.The restaurant's atmosphere was pure understated elegance. I was slightly intimidated walking down the long entrance hallway, but that feeling mostly faded as the friendly staff guided my mom, sister and I past the waiting space and into the single-room dining area. It was surprisingly unassuming, filled with soft beiges and mauves. Throughout the meal the servers were warm, helpful and professional--the only hiccup came when my sister's turbot arrived a bit too early and had to make a brief retreat.Now for the food. The meal began with three tiny, unexpected hors d'oeuvres: a fluffy little parmesan dumpling (good), a cheesy, crunchy ball topped with salty iberico ham (excellent) and a seaweed-wrapped, sashimi-like cured salmon (excellent). The next surprise item was a bright green ricotta dish, beautifully plated with fresh vegetables (tangy and salty, every bite slightly different).Then the appetizers: I was a served a single giant lobster, langoustine and salmon ravioli, surrounded with a wood sorrel sauce (also bright green). It had a balanced, hearty seafood flavor, and the savory wood sorrel was oddly addictive. My dining partners both had the scallops--I'm not normally a fan, but these were probably the best I've tasted. They came with two sauces: a nice sweet apple-based one and another (even better) that was concentrated with walnut flavor.Entrees: My sister had the turbot with greens and an unidentified vegetable (sea beet?)--nicely seasoned and meaty, but not really a standout. My mom and I had pork five ways. The chou farci (stuffed cabbage) was my least favorite, salty but otherwise unexciting. (There was also a smidge of applesauce that I tried but mostly avoided.) The sausage was also slightly disappointing, but still well-spiced and quite decent. The loin was elevated by some slightly acidic potatoes and bite of thin, perfectly crisp bacon. The suckling pig was tender and flavorful, accented by sweet bit of pineapple......And then there was pork belly. Oh, the pork belly. This razor-thin rectangle of salty, fatty goodness was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The brilliance of it was the contrast in textures: immaculately crispy on the top layer, melt-in-your-mouth tender on the bottom. It came with two preparations of apple--one baked, one fresh and thin-sliced. It was good with them, it was good without them. It was just good.Another intermission: a sweet, brightly flavored mango-passion fruit beverage that was a lovely pre-dessert palate cleanser. We split our three desserts evenly between us. The peppermint souffle was immensely fluffy--so much so that it was essentially a minty egg foam. A bit strange, but better with the chocolate sorbet (which there should've been more of). The chocolate, praline mousse and granola dish was very nice, possibly the best of the three and a nice mix of sweet and pleasantly bitter. The lemonade parfait was easily the most interesting one, jam-packed with sweet and sour flavor. It came with a beautifully spun honey tuile ring, a creamy sheep's milk sorbet and a tangy bergamot gel.Finally, three more mini-surprises. The elderflower Turkish delight was an appropriately floral gelatin treat. The thin wafers of chocolate peanut brittle were nothing very unusual, but delicious with a balanced sweet-saltiness. The white-chocolate-dipped morsels of strawberry ice cream, immersed in dry ice fog for maximum effect, were a memorable end to a spectacular dinner.My meal here was delicious and inventive, with several hits and only a couple of partial misses. I would love to make a return pilgrimage someday and try their even more elaborate ""prestige"" or ""seasonal inspiration"" menus.

140	1.0	"Although the food was exquisite, the service, unfortunately, was not. I had lunch at the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on Nov 4. I showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal. I understand the importance of no-show fees, but here's what was wrong. - 2 people in our party of 4 couldn't come, and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size (the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice)...only, the restaurant didn't actually change our party size. - The people who showed up (myself and a friend) were charged 100 pounds/person for the people who didn't show, even though I wasn't liable for the reservation. My friend who couldn't come had made the reservation, and the charge should've gone to the card on file for the reservation (her card).- Gordon Ramsay restaurant has conflicting ""no-show/cancellation"" policies on their OpenTable home page, their website, OpenTable confirmation email, and information relayed by the restaurant representative. Only the person making the reservation on OpenTable had access to the ""accurate"" policy -- which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed. Notifying the restaurant isn't enough.- Also note, the per person no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person.During the actual dining experience, the manager stopped by all tables except ours, and I was told to contact the restaurant via email. It then took 10+ emails for the manager to admit that Gordon Ramsay should've charged the card on file. Turns out, he didn't charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated (he has to go through an account executive at the main office). Regretfully, the manager didn't realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up, my dining experience was negatively affected. I still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from Gordon Ramsay and the way in which the no-show fees were handled.   So here is my sad, but quick tip to you: - If your complete party can't make it, order the lunch set menu for the ""invisible people"" in your party. You'll save 35 pounds per person. The no-show fee is 100 pounds, but the lunch set menu is only 65 pounds."	although the food was exquisite  the service  unfortunately  was not  i had lunch at the gordon ramsay restaurant on nov 4  i showed up and was charged 200 pounds directly to my lunch meal  i understand the importance of no show fees  but here s what was wrong    2 people in our party of 4 couldn t come  and my friend had called a week in advance to change the party size  the restaurant requires 48 hrs advance notice    only  the restaurant didn t actually change our party size    the people who showed up  myself and a friend  were charged 100 pounds person for the people who didn t show  even though i wasn t liable for the reservation  my friend who couldn t come had made the reservation  and the charge should ve gone to the card on file for the reservation  her card    gordon ramsay restaurant has conflicting  no show cancellation  policies on their opentable home page  their website  opentable confirmation email  and information relayed by the restaurant representative  only the person making the reservation on opentable had access to the  accurate  policy    which apparently is that the party size has to be successfully changed  notifying the restaurant isn t enough   also note  the per person no show fee is 100 pounds  but the lunch menu is only 65 pounds per person during the actual dining experience  the manager stopped by all tables except ours  and i was told to contact the restaurant via email  it then took 10  emails for the manager to admit that gordon ramsay should ve charged the card on file  turns out  he didn t charge the card on file because the process is longer and more complicated  he has to go through an account executive at the main office   regretfully  the manager didn t realize that as he cut some corners on the correct process and charged the fee directly to the meal of people who did show up  my dining experience was negatively affected  i still have yet to receive an apology for the miscommunication from gordon ramsay and the way in which the no show fees were handled    so here is my sad  but quick tip to you    if your complete party can t make it  order the lunch set menu for the  invisible people  in your party  you ll save 35 pounds per person  the no show fee is 100 pounds  but the lunch set menu is only 65 pounds 
141	5.0	The two-hour meal I savored during my first trip to London in early July ranks as the best belated birthday present I have ever received. My father and stepmother treated me to a lunch I will remember for the rest of my life.The petite dining room features a mere 14 tables, yet it packs enough charm and splendor to fill a big box store. Never attempt to eat here sans a reservation. Secure a spot at least one week in advance just to be safe. My sister, who lives in London, placed a call almost a month prior to our visit.Gordon Ramsay's posh flagship on Royal Hospital Road employs enough wait staff to allow each member to serve a specific course. Another paramount consideration: This is not a fast-food, dash-in and dash-out establishment. A leisurely, glacial pace of food consumption is essential if you want to appreciate the myriad flavors married by Chef Patron Clare Smyth.We ordered from the lunch menu and elected for the three-course option, which costs 55 pounds per head. As the five-star rating should indicate, not one pound of the exorbitant bill was wasted.The extravagant cuisine adventure commenced with a complimentary consomme. The made-from-rich-flavored stock was drinkable, with baby radishes, heirloom tomatoes and chives delicately assembled in the center of the bowl. I did not leave a trace of this delightful opener on the plate.I opted to start with the roasted quail with soy honey, togorashi, pickled vegetables and herbs. The house-made soy sauce and dijon mustard rim delivered a perfect accompaniment for the two wing cuts of soft roasted bird. I cannot remember enjoying another quail dish more than this.Next, I selected the roasted rabbit loin with Bayonne ham, salted baked turnips, toasted hazelnuts and pickled mustard seed. The exquisite presentation of this and every other dish served at the restaurant merits museum enshrinement. The many components at work on the wide plate bonded beautifully. The mustard seed and savory sauce enhanced the wonders of each diminutive bite.Throughout the afternoon, one wait staff member offered three different breads paired with finely sculpted salted and unsalted butter towers. The onion bacon brioche ranked as my favorite.For my last official course, dessert, I chose the chocolate bars with toasted milk mousse and tonka bean ice cream. As much as I love caramel popcorn, I would not have pictured it as a sinful ally in a gourmet dessert dish. Each bite of popcorn with a splash of the milk mousse was even better than the previous one. The caramel, dark and milk chocolate bars melted in my mouth. You can't buy candy this delectable at a convenience store.Patrons also receive a complimentary dessert tray with four ice cream balls served in a bowl of steaming dry ice plus two lemon Turkish delights and two chocolate ganache squares.The championship clincher of this five-star experience: Waiters had eavesdropped on our table during an earlier birthday toast and brought me a sixth course, a miniature but wicked chocolate-hazelnut cake complete with a candle. That they nailed my favorite sweet combination, most often referred to as Nutella or Bacio, has to be the greatest instance of dumb luck ever. Wow!Wait at least one minute after receiving each dish because servers tend to return in a few moments with extra goodies and garnishes for your selected item.This extraordinary day also included the British Museum, the London Eye and Coldplay at the Royal Albert Hall.

143	5.0	A real 5 star yelp experience for a 3 Michelin star establishment.Starting with the friendly welcome from the doorman and the greeting from the staff, we were shown to our table, a snug table in a comfortable, relaxed dining room that was both luxurious and slightly understated which created an exclusive yet completely unstuffy vibe.We started with champagne, of course, served from a magnum bottle, several varieties on offer in ascending price.The wine menu weighs as much as an encyclopedia. The sommelier came over to discuss the style of wine we were looking for. Her reco was spot on.The starter of scallops with apples and walnuts was perfect.For mains I chose the suckling pig cooked four ways.Desert choice was chocolate cylinder with ginger mousse.Each course was perfectly presented and composed with winning taste combinations. I could have been happy with any of the dishes on the menu and making a choice was hard. Fish & seafood seems to be a particular standout here so maybe I should have opted for a fish main course also. The dishes are sophisticated expertly created yet the menu descriptions are straightforward. I like that lack of pretension.A good variety of interesting of amuse bouches added more excitement between courses and the Maitre D' stopped by for a chat. A nice touch which just added to the overall pleasant and relaxed ambience.Every member of the staff excelled and the whole meal was so well coordinated it was perfection.A special dining experience that I would love to repeat again. A key metric for me is value for money but that doesn't mean everything has to be cheap. But expectations are high when the price is high and Gordon Ramsay delivered.	a real 5 star yelp experience for a 3 michelin star establishment starting with the friendly welcome from the doorman and the greeting from the staff  we were shown to our table  a snug table in a comfortable  relaxed dining room that was both luxurious and slightly understated which created an exclusive yet completely unstuffy vibe we started with champagne  of course  served from a magnum bottle  several varieties on offer in ascending price the wine menu weighs as much as an encyclopedia  the sommelier came over to discuss the style of wine we were looking for  her reco was spot on the starter of scallops with apples and walnuts was perfect for mains i chose the suckling pig cooked four ways desert choice was chocolate cylinder with ginger mousse each course was perfectly presented and composed with winning taste combinations  i could have been happy with any of the dishes on the menu and making a choice was hard  fish   seafood seems to be a particular standout here so maybe i should have opted for a fish main course also  the dishes are sophisticated expertly created yet the menu descriptions are straightforward  i like that lack of pretension a good variety of interesting of amuse bouches added more excitement between courses and the maitre d  stopped by for a chat  a nice touch which just added to the overall pleasant and relaxed ambience every member of the staff excelled and the whole meal was so well coordinated it was perfection a special dining experience that i would love to repeat again  a key metric for me is value for money but that doesn t mean everything has to be cheap  but expectations are high when the price is high and gordon ramsay delivered

146	4.0	I came here for my recent birthday dinner and I had a very pleasant evening. The tasting menu that I did was really delicious, and the presentation was superb. I think the presentation was a bit better than the actual food, but hey, I am a picky girl. The service was outstanding, but what really stood out was the wine list. They have a separate champagne list which absolutely excites me. They also had a Salon '99 by the glass. How can you pass on Salon? Overall, it was a beautiful night and I am glad I finally tried it.	i came here for my recent birthday dinner and i had a very pleasant evening  the tasting menu that i did was really delicious  and the presentation was superb  i think the presentation was a bit better than the actual food  but hey  i am a picky girl  the service was outstanding  but what really stood out was the wine list  they have a separate champagne list which absolutely excites me  they also had a salon  99 by the glass  how can you pass on salon  overall  it was a beautiful night and i am glad i finally tried it 
147	3.0	Booked a birthday lunch here earlier in July. Despite being a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, this was sadly the most painful 3-Michelin star dining experience I've had in ages, and I'm not referring to the price. The service at Ramsay's was well-balanced and not overly stuffy. Everything about the restaurant was immaculate--elegant and on point. But that was it, it was a bit too sterile and the dining room was not particularly inviting.  We opted for the Menu Prestige. The only items that stood out for me were the lobster ravioli (which was both nice to look at and had great flavour) and the desserts (which were all very pretty but unpalatable -- it took a great act of will to finish my plate as I did not want to be rude, but hubs didn't even bother and pushed his plate back). The entire meal looked amazing but the focus was too much on presentation and not enough on flavours and textures. So this was a massive disappointment. Sadly, we shall not be returning after an unimpressive culinary experience.	booked a birthday lunch here earlier in july  despite being a huge gordon ramsay fan  this was sadly the most painful 3 michelin star dining experience i ve had in ages  and i m not referring to the price  the service at ramsay s was well balanced and not overly stuffy  everything about the restaurant was immaculate  elegant and on point  but that was it  it was a bit too sterile and the dining room was not particularly inviting   we opted for the menu prestige  the only items that stood out for me were the lobster ravioli  which was both nice to look at and had great flavour  and the desserts  which were all very pretty but unpalatable    it took a great act of will to finish my plate as i did not want to be rude  but hubs didn t even bother and pushed his plate back   the entire meal looked amazing but the focus was too much on presentation and not enough on flavours and textures  so this was a massive disappointment  sadly  we shall not be returning after an unimpressive culinary experience

149	5.0	Came here on a trip a while back. I'm not used to this level of cooking. Literally put - perfect. I have never seen a better display of craft, ingredient quality, service, and overall atmosphere to this place. I did notice the kitchen was somehow really quiet? I don't know how they pulled that off but props to them. I would absolutely return here for pleasure whenever I see myself in London again. Just wow.	came here on a trip a while back  i m not used to this level of cooking  literally put   perfect  i have never seen a better display of craft  ingredient quality  service  and overall atmosphere to this place  i did notice the kitchen was somehow really quiet  i don t know how they pulled that off but props to them  i would absolutely return here for pleasure whenever i see myself in london again  just wow 
150	5.0	Usually places like this are over-hyped but man, I was so impressed! Everything was   exactly what you'd expect from a 3 Michelin star restaurant: beautiful decor, stellar service, and amazing food. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. We made a reservation for 12PM lunch and half the room was taken up by 12PM (by 12:30PM it was completely booked). It's not a very large space at all so definitely plan ahead.Sautéed foie graswith roasted veal sweetbreads, carrots, almonds and Cabernet Sauvignon vinegar - California foie gras lovers, this one doesn't disappoint. If you're going to order foie gras here, order this dish and not the other one (per the recommendation of the wait staff)Fillet of line caught sea bass with cucumber, samphire, steamed charlotte potatoes, oyster and caviar sauce - Solid entree but what actually really impressed me about this dish was the sauce. The sauce was so good I had to refrain from licking the plate. Seriously. Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbet - Beautiful presentation, solid dessert to finish the meal.It's always hard to describe the items esp when the menu is changing but everything was fantastic. It's not cheap (even for lunch) so be prepared to burn a hole in your wallet but it's a hole worth definitely burning.	usually places like this are over hyped but man  i was so impressed  everything was   exactly what you d expect from a 3 michelin star restaurant  beautiful decor  stellar service  and amazing food  make sure to make a reservation ahead of time  we made a reservation for 12pm lunch and half the room was taken up by 12pm  by 12 30pm it was completely booked   it s not a very large space at all so definitely plan ahead saut ed foie graswith roasted veal sweetbreads  carrots  almonds and cabernet sauvignon vinegar   california foie gras lovers  this one doesn t disappoint  if you re going to order foie gras here  order this dish and not the other one  per the recommendation of the wait staff fillet of line caught sea bass with cucumber  samphire  steamed charlotte potatoes  oyster and caviar sauce   solid entree but what actually really impressed me about this dish was the sauce  the sauce was so good i had to refrain from licking the plate  seriously  lemonade parfait with honey  bergamot and sheep s milk yoghurt sorbet   beautiful presentation  solid dessert to finish the meal it s always hard to describe the items esp when the menu is changing but everything was fantastic  it s not cheap  even for lunch  so be prepared to burn a hole in your wallet but it s a hole worth definitely burning 
151	5.0	This place is truly top notch in terms of food and services. We went with the Prestige menu and I opted for the pigeon option whereas my husband did lamb. I loved the pigeon so much better! The pace was great and ambiance was really relaxing.	this place is truly top notch in terms of food and services  we went with the prestige menu and i opted for the pigeon option whereas my husband did lamb  i loved the pigeon so much better  the pace was great and ambiance was really relaxing 
152	5.0	Had dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay this past week and it was most definitely the best meal I have ever had in any restaurant!  From our arrival to our departure more than three hours later, everything about our evening was totally perfect.  We were warmly greeted and shown to our table in this beautifully decorated dining room.  Our party chose the 7 course seasonal inspirations tasting menu and everything was so delicious.  We were brought several 'amuse bouche' dishes ahead of our tasting menu and the bread basket was brought round every time there was a new course.  Unsure what wine to choose, I asked the sommelier for advice and he provided excellent suggestions on different wine pairings.  As each course arrived, there were usually 2 or 3 waiters, serving the food to each of us in unison - so perfectly choreographed!  The Maitre D' was great and came by our table several times for a chat, but was not intrusive at all.  At the end of the meal he invited us to visit the kitchen and we were treated to an amazing sight of the chefs putting together their wonderful creations.  I was surprised at the quiet and calm in the kitchen, with so much concentration - it was not at all noisy as I might have expected. During coffee they brought my husband a birthday cake and all of us chocolates - a nice unexpected surprise.  We were also given a copy of the menu signed by the executive chef - this was a lovely memento to bring home with us.The meal was most definitely the most memorable dining experience of our lives so far and we would return in a heartbeat - they deserve all 3 of their Michelin stars.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere.	had dinner at restaurant gordon ramsay this past week and it was most definitely the best meal i have ever had in any restaurant   from our arrival to our departure more than three hours later  everything about our evening was totally perfect   we were warmly greeted and shown to our table in this beautifully decorated dining room   our party chose the 7 course seasonal inspirations tasting menu and everything was so delicious   we were brought several  amuse bouche  dishes ahead of our tasting menu and the bread basket was brought round every time there was a new course   unsure what wine to choose  i asked the sommelier for advice and he provided excellent suggestions on different wine pairings   as each course arrived  there were usually 2 or 3 waiters  serving the food to each of us in unison   so perfectly choreographed   the maitre d  was great and came by our table several times for a chat  but was not intrusive at all   at the end of the meal he invited us to visit the kitchen and we were treated to an amazing sight of the chefs putting together their wonderful creations   i was surprised at the quiet and calm in the kitchen  with so much concentration   it was not at all noisy as i might have expected  during coffee they brought my husband a birthday cake and all of us chocolates   a nice unexpected surprise   we were also given a copy of the menu signed by the executive chef   this was a lovely memento to bring home with us the meal was most definitely the most memorable dining experience of our lives so far and we would return in a heartbeat   they deserve all 3 of their michelin stars   great food  great service  great atmosphere 
153	5.0	I went here a couple of weeks ago while on vacation with my girlfriend. This restaurant was absolutely amazing. Probably some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They always made sure we had what we needed and were constantly refilling our drinks right when we needed them refilled. They knew what to do before I even knew. I was also really nervous as I had never eaten a 3 michelin star restaurant so I didn't want to accidentally do something wrong.Anyway, I ordered off the lunch menu and got the globe artichoke, rabbit loin, and vanilla parfait. The globe artichoke was probably the best appetizer I have ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Just absolutely amazing. The rabbit loin I had after was also absolutely delicious in every way. One of the best entrees ever.  Cooked perfectly and absolutely amazing in every way.Then the dessert came and that was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best dessert I have ever had. They poured frozen olive oil on it and I just couldn't believe how good the vanilla parfait was. It was hard for me to believe, even now, that a vanilla parfait could be that good. They also had a chicken mousse soup starter and these white chocolate balls with some squares for dessert. All of it was amazing. And for a fancy restaurant the food was actually quite filling. We also were here for a while but it didn't feel like that long as there was always food on my plate or there was about to be food on my plate.I highly recommend if you can get a reservation to go here.

154	5.0	The wife and I managed to secure a booking on very short notice and after a quick trip on the tube and a short walk past the home of the Chelsea Pensioners (fun!), we arrived at the unobtrusive door of Gordon Ramsay. One look at the tiny dining room (with 30 seats, tops) and the large number of servers (about 10, by my count) told us that we would be in for a pampering.And it was. What a feast for the senses! We both ordered the Menu Prestige prix free menu and a lovely bottle of chinon to go with it (recommended by the friendly sommelier who also suggested that my wife pick up a pair of Hunter wellingtons to make our trip extra-British). Every dish was thoughtfully prepared and engaging to all the senses. We were invited to smell the sauces before they were poured. The dishes themselves were works of art and tasted like heaven. Some dishes delved slightly into molecular gastronomy- honey that crunched and bread that literally melted in your mouth. The sight of the squad of waitstaff moving through the dining room with poise and precision fascinated everyone. And the invitation to walk through the kitchen was so thoughtful.Sure, we blew a good chunk of change on this place, but it was worth every penny. We left excited, full (which always surprises me at places like this), and invigorated.	the wife and i managed to secure a booking on very short notice and after a quick trip on the tube and a short walk past the home of the chelsea pensioners  fun    we arrived at the unobtrusive door of gordon ramsay  one look at the tiny dining room  with 30 seats  tops  and the large number of servers  about 10  by my count  told us that we would be in for a pampering and it was  what a feast for the senses  we both ordered the menu prestige prix free menu and a lovely bottle of chinon to go with it  recommended by the friendly sommelier who also suggested that my wife pick up a pair of hunter wellingtons to make our trip extra british   every dish was thoughtfully prepared and engaging to all the senses  we were invited to smell the sauces before they were poured  the dishes themselves were works of art and tasted like heaven  some dishes delved slightly into molecular gastronomy  honey that crunched and bread that literally melted in your mouth  the sight of the squad of waitstaff moving through the dining room with poise and precision fascinated everyone  and the invitation to walk through the kitchen was so thoughtful sure  we blew a good chunk of change on this place  but it was worth every penny  we left excited  full  which always surprises me at places like this   and invigorated 
155	5.0	Excellent experience, great food, exceptional service.  One of the employees greeted us as we got out of the taxi and led us to the door of the restaurant where another guy was there ready to check in our coats.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and it felt very cozy.  The service was exceptional.  May of the staff are there to attend to your every need.  At one point during the dinner, I was getting up to go to the bathroom.  As soon as I moved my chair back slightly to get up, the waiter already anticipated my action and moved the chair back for me.  He proceeded to direct me to the restroom where another staff member was already there holding the door open for me.  They called the taxi for us at the end of the dinner and gave us a tour of the kitchen while waiting for the taxi.The food is spectacular..as expected for a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  We ordered the prestige menu offering seven courses.  More if you counted the three small appetizers and amuse bouche.  We started with the Foie Gras...very light and flavorful as you eat it with a few small slivers of duck on the side.  The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I wanted more, but knew I had to save room for more courses.  I ordered pigeon for my entree.  Very tender...not as gamy as a quail.  I really enjoyed it.  I also tried the lamb from my sister's plate..also spectacular.  The desserts were my favorite treat.  presented like a piece of art in front of you.Overall, an excellent experience.  Not to be missed when you are visiting London.	excellent experience  great food  exceptional service   one of the employees greeted us as we got out of the taxi and led us to the door of the restaurant where another guy was there ready to check in our coats   the restaurant was smaller than i expected  and it felt very cozy   the service was exceptional   may of the staff are there to attend to your every need   at one point during the dinner  i was getting up to go to the bathroom   as soon as i moved my chair back slightly to get up  the waiter already anticipated my action and moved the chair back for me   he proceeded to direct me to the restroom where another staff member was already there holding the door open for me   they called the taxi for us at the end of the dinner and gave us a tour of the kitchen while waiting for the taxi the food is spectacular  as expected for a 3 star michelin restaurant   we ordered the prestige menu offering seven courses   more if you counted the three small appetizers and amuse bouche   we started with the foie gras   very light and flavorful as you eat it with a few small slivers of duck on the side   the lobster ravioli was excellent   i wanted more  but knew i had to save room for more courses   i ordered pigeon for my entree   very tender   not as gamy as a quail   i really enjoyed it   i also tried the lamb from my sister s plate  also spectacular   the desserts were my favorite treat   presented like a piece of art in front of you overall  an excellent experience   not to be missed when you are visiting london

158	4.0	"My first Michelin 3 star restaurant as well! :)Amazing amazing food. Amazing service. Amazing decor.You have to book months in advance to secure a table. I booked it back in May for my July trip and I was only able to book a lunch :(. They take down your credit card number so if you don't show up or don't cancel within 24 hrs, you get fined 100 pounds--about $162.I ordered the Menu Prestige, which consists of 7 plates. I highly recommend this menu to sample all of Ramsay's food.1. Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble - This foie gras had a harder texture and was less buttery than the others I've tried, but still very good.2. Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a chervil velouté - DELICIOUS dish!! So good. It was a fatty ravioli with a generous amount of lobster. Sauce was amazing--went together very well.3.Roasted fillet of line caught turbot with English asparagus and morels - Can't decide if this or the ravioli was my favorite. This fish was delicious! Couldn't taste the sea flavor, which is a definite plus.  So good I forgot to take a picture :(4. Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of summer vegetables - not a fan of lamb, but if all lamb dishes tasted like this, then I'm sold! Super tender and the vegetables were a good addition.5.Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice - So GOOD. One of the better creme brulee's I've tasted. the Granny Smith apple juice was unbelievable!!!! BEST apple juice I've tasted. I think all apple juices should be made from Granny Smith Apples. Yum! I might even blend some for myself.6. Mango, jasmine and passion fruit soup - Yum!! This ""soup"" was so good! 7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm Eton mess with vanilla ice cream wafer - Wasn't a fan of this dessert. :( I dont really like sorberts. But I did like the wafer and the plating was absolutely beautiful.Bonus: Silver Chocolate Truffle Tree - So unique and so pretty. Fun to pick off of and pop in your mouth.Bonus #2: White Chocolate Covered Strawberry Balls in Smokey Dry Ice - Again, another unique dish. The smoke coming out of the dry ice was such a cool effect. Great experience. Never had such attentive waiters. But of course, this amazing-ness comes with a hefty price tag.

161	4.0	Gordon Ramsay was my first Michelin star dining experience in London. Since I've been to many others, I keep rethinking my five-star review, and I think that it really doesn't deserve that fifth star. Don't get me wrong. I had a great time. The food was exceptional. It just wasn't memorable. Nothing wowed me. (Check my previous review for my experience there.) It was just lacking something that I had experienced at other three-Michelin star restaurants. I thought it was perhaps those were just exceptional, but now that I've gone to other ones in the UK, I've come to realize that Gordon Ramsay just doesn't hold up to these others.It still gets four stars though. Mostly because my lovely other half bought me a cooking Masterclass here for my birthday. In case you didn't know, they offer one occasionally. I showed up bright and early at around 9 am where they had pastries and coffee waiting. We then went into the kitchen and prepped a three-course lunch for the next three hours. Then you and a plus one get to eat your three course menu with pretty much unlimited wine. It was fantastic. I had an amazing time learning kitchen skills and hanging out with the sous chef and some of the other chefs at the restaurant. Our meal consisted of salmon and lobster tortellini (similar to the ravioli, but smaller), mini beef wellingtons and a salted caramel chocolate fondant. At the end they give you the menu with the wine pairings and recipes for all the food you've cooked.Granted it's not cheap, but it makes for one hell of an experience if you know someone who loves to cook. It's quiet and intimate just having a lunch with the people in the class and their plus ones. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. In fact, I would recommend it over actually dining at the restaurant. There are far better places to go have a nice meal, but not many where you can actually help cook it!	gordon ramsay was my first michelin star dining experience in london  since i ve been to many others  i keep rethinking my five star review  and i think that it really doesn t deserve that fifth star  don t get me wrong  i had a great time  the food was exceptional  it just wasn t memorable  nothing wowed me   check my previous review for my experience there   it was just lacking something that i had experienced at other three michelin star restaurants  i thought it was perhaps those were just exceptional  but now that i ve gone to other ones in the uk  i ve come to realize that gordon ramsay just doesn t hold up to these others it still gets four stars though  mostly because my lovely other half bought me a cooking masterclass here for my birthday  in case you didn t know  they offer one occasionally  i showed up bright and early at around 9 am where they had pastries and coffee waiting  we then went into the kitchen and prepped a three course lunch for the next three hours  then you and a plus one get to eat your three course menu with pretty much unlimited wine  it was fantastic  i had an amazing time learning kitchen skills and hanging out with the sous chef and some of the other chefs at the restaurant  our meal consisted of salmon and lobster tortellini  similar to the ravioli  but smaller   mini beef wellingtons and a salted caramel chocolate fondant  at the end they give you the menu with the wine pairings and recipes for all the food you ve cooked granted it s not cheap  but it makes for one hell of an experience if you know someone who loves to cook  it s quiet and intimate just having a lunch with the people in the class and their plus ones  i would recommend it in a heartbeat  in fact  i would recommend it over actually dining at the restaurant  there are far better places to go have a nice meal  but not many where you can actually help cook it 
162	4.0	My wife and I came here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.  It was an appropriate restaurant for the occasion and we were treated to excellent and attentive service.  We both had the Seasonal Inspiration menu:1. Poached Scottish lobster tail with lardo di Colonnata, vegetables à la Grecque and coral vinaigrette2. 'Carbonara', Iberico ham and four year old parmesan.3. Assiette of spring vegetables cooked en cocotte with Périgord truffle4. Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, spiced shoulder sausage, chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions5. Rove des Guarrigues with confit beetroot, toasted amaranth seeds and Manni olive oil6. Green apple and lime sorbet with shiso, avocado and eucalyptus7. Gariguette strawberry and lemon balm 'Eton mess'All of the dishes were tasty and well-presented.  The highlight for me was the sucking pig dish - you got a sample size of pork done many ways, my favourite part was the crackling.I also enjoyed the 'carbonara', there were obviously a lot of different cooking techniques which went into this dish, to ensure that the pasta was cooked to the right level and the egg yolk was still runny.  The green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner: it really hit the spot.The assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me, nothing too special about that one.  In the same way, the final course was simply strawberries with meringue.  With application, I'm sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home.The service was slick and well-practised, however, I sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming, which I hadn't experienced at other 3-star michelin star restaurants.Overall, an excellent evening, but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4-star rating.	my wife and i came here to celebrate our first wedding anniversary   it was an appropriate restaurant for the occasion and we were treated to excellent and attentive service   we both had the seasonal inspiration menu 1  poached scottish lobster tail with lardo di colonnata  vegetables   la grecque and coral vinaigrette2   carbonara   iberico ham and four year old parmesan 3  assiette of spring vegetables cooked en cocotte with p rigord truffle4  suckling pig  crispy belly  roasted loin  spiced shoulder sausage  chou farci with crushed potatoes and spring onions5  rove des guarrigues with confit beetroot  toasted amaranth seeds and manni olive oil6  green apple and lime sorbet with shiso  avocado and eucalyptus7  gariguette strawberry and lemon balm  eton mess all of the dishes were tasty and well presented   the highlight for me was the sucking pig dish   you got a sample size of pork done many ways  my favourite part was the crackling i also enjoyed the  carbonara   there were obviously a lot of different cooking techniques which went into this dish  to ensure that the pasta was cooked to the right level and the egg yolk was still runny   the green apple and lime sorbet was a refreshing dish which came as just the right stage of the dinner  it really hit the spot the assiette of spring vegetables just seemed like a plate of nicely cooked vegetables to me  nothing too special about that one   in the same way  the final course was simply strawberries with meringue   with application  i m sure we could find a nice punnet of strawberries ourselves to enjoy at home the service was slick and well practised  however  i sometimes found myself thinking about when the next course was coming  which i hadn t experienced at other 3 star michelin star restaurants overall  an excellent evening  but the minor points noted above contributed to my 4 star rating 
163	5.0	It's been several months since my meal at Gordon Ramsay, and while many of the  details of that night have escaped me, I'm as certain now as I was that day - this is one of the top restaurants I've experienced, and likely every will.Everything about GR was perfect, from start to finish.  The food (of course) was amazing.  But the service is what I'll remember, and is the standard that I'll hold any top restaurant to from this day on.  As a tourist in London, I can honestly say that they made me feel completely welcome and taken care of, and I could not have felt more at home if I were in my own dining room.I have no doubt that years from now, I'll still look back on that night with warm memories, and I look forward to the time that I might once again experience that magic.  Bravo.	it s been several months since my meal at gordon ramsay  and while many of the  details of that night have escaped me  i m as certain now as i was that day   this is one of the top restaurants i ve experienced  and likely every will everything about gr was perfect  from start to finish   the food  of course  was amazing   but the service is what i ll remember  and is the standard that i ll hold any top restaurant to from this day on   as a tourist in london  i can honestly say that they made me feel completely welcome and taken care of  and i could not have felt more at home if i were in my own dining room i have no doubt that years from now  i ll still look back on that night with warm memories  and i look forward to the time that i might once again experience that magic   bravo 
164	5.0	I have been there for the first time last November (29th to be specific)- and I remember it with a big smile on my faceIt was my partner's birthday and I booked it two weeks in advance (wash chuffed I was able to find a table) The fact that you have to enter your credit card details in order to secure the booking was not thrilling and I kept of receiving calls to confirm the booking every day on the week of the booking ( I was not available to answer) I expected it to be posh and it was so so posh - it is traditional restaurant when it comes to the setting but everyone around you makes you feel you have to act in a certain way! It was the poshest place I have eaten at in my life. Having said that I was so relaxed with the service - I have to thank them for making my night- they are friendly, they joke, and they suggest things to do after dinner, they even celebrated my boyfriend's birthday and send a complimentary tiny cake to our table. It is a service I can' t forget We went for the taster menu and it was divine I thought I won't get enough food out of smaller portions but by the fourth course I was full Beside the extremely delicious artistically presented dishes, the wine selection is incredible.

165	2.0	"Let me preface this by saying I am very sure we had a fluke experience here.  Something went very, very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm. But it was such a dramatic departure from every other Michelin *'d restaurant I've visited that I feel the need to share.  When we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at RGR I really wish we had chosen another place to complement the (exemplary!) Fat Duck on our London trip.  I also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and... received no follow-up.  Not a word.  So this is long, but hey! Now I've got a bone to pick. :)In the restaurant's online follow-up survey, I chose ""fair"" to describe the service; a more accurate description would have been ""Flawless, followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible.""  After the listed courses on the menu were complete, we were offered coffee (which I accepted and my husband declined) and were told that ""chocolates"" would be forthcoming. The coffee arrived, I drank it, and time passed.  Other tables were continuing to be served.  Eventually my empty cup was taken away and I declined further coffee.  Perplexingly, my husband than received a clean plate in front of him (I did not).  We sat.  More time passed.  We started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other's company.  Eventually (after about half an hour from when coffee was served) we were offered to see the kitchen, which we accepted.  Upon our return from the kitchen, I saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the (alleged) chocolates would arrive shortly.  Adjacent diners finished their meals, left, and the tables had new people seated at them. After another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous.  We actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on. (!)  The gentleman who I assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn't pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee?  Which was quite odd, given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee, and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us.  Not to mention the fact that my husband never actually HAD any coffee in the first place.  We asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier, and he said, yes, the white chocolate course.  Pause.  We said we hadn't had it.  He said, ""Yes, with the liquid nitrogen?  The strawberries and white chocolate?""  (As if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice?)  We again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes.  He said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived.  Then we finished, paid, and exited, completely confused by what had just happened.  At no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour, without so much as a cursory check-in, certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service.  To be forgotten is one thing; to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that.    We have had the pleasure of dining at many Michelin two- and three-star restaurants, and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre.  Unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out.   (On the other hand, it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends, which we certainly have been.) All in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro-land, followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong.  Funny though it is in hindsight it was also really disappointing!"	let me preface this by saying i am very sure we had a fluke experience here   something went very  very wrong on our visit that is obviously not the norm  but it was such a dramatic departure from every other michelin   d restaurant i ve visited that i feel the need to share   when we travel we choose the restaurants we visit very carefully and after our service fiasco at rgr i really wish we had chosen another place to complement the  exemplary   fat duck on our london trip   i also sent the below feedback directly to the restaurant and    received no follow up   not a word   so this is long  but hey  now i ve got a bone to pick    in the restaurant s online follow up survey  i chose  fair  to describe the service  a more accurate description would have been  flawless  followed suddenly by a flip to confusingly terrible    after the listed courses on the menu were complete  we were offered coffee  which i accepted and my husband declined  and were told that  chocolates  would be forthcoming  the coffee arrived  i drank it  and time passed   other tables were continuing to be served   eventually my empty cup was taken away and i declined further coffee   perplexingly  my husband than received a clean plate in front of him  i did not    we sat   more time passed   we started to think this was a bit awkward but continued to wait and enjoy each other s company   eventually  after about half an hour from when coffee was served  we were offered to see the kitchen  which we accepted   upon our return from the kitchen  i saw my place also now also had one of the mysterious plates and we assumed the  alleged  chocolates would arrive shortly   adjacent diners finished their meals  left  and the tables had new people seated at them  after another 15 minutes of being ignored entirely by staff we decided it was getting ridiculous   we actually had to flag down a server and ask what was going on       the gentleman who i assume is the front of house came to our table and said that we hadn t pushed our plates away and therefore it was assumed we wanted more coffee   which was quite odd  given that we had both explicitly turned down more coffee  and in any case if the plates were coding this no one actually ever came by to offer it to us   not to mention the fact that my husband never actually had any coffee in the first place   we asked about the chocolates he had mentioned earlier  and he said  yes  the white chocolate course   pause   we said we hadn t had it   he said   yes  with the liquid nitrogen   the strawberries and white chocolate     as if we would have perhaps forgotten a course with a centerpiece of dry ice    we again said that we had not received this course and in fact had been ignored for the last 45 minutes   he said he would get it and then about five minutes later it finally arrived   then we finished  paid  and exited  completely confused by what had just happened   at no point did any of the service staff acknowledge that it is completely weird and inappropriate for diners to be left on entirely their own for nearly an hour  without so much as a cursory check in  certainly at a restaurant with such a reputation for exemplary service   to be forgotten is one thing  to not have even the slightest acknowledgement of the inconvenience and confusion it created in our evening is quite another thing on top of that     we have had the pleasure of dining at many michelin two  and three star restaurants  and this was by far the most bizarre service experience we have ever had at an establishment of this calibre   unfortunately the experience at the end of our meal soured what would otherwise have been almost a literally perfect evening out     on the other hand  it has given us a hilarious story to share with our friends  which we certainly have been   all in all it was a lovely evening that ended up in bizarro land  followed by what appeared to be a completely oblivious unawareness from staff that anything was even wrong   funny though it is in hindsight it was also really disappointing 
166	5.0	I can't believe that there is anyone who would give this establishment less than 5 stars. In fact, I don't even think 5 stars does it justice. I feel like either Yelp needs to create a 6th star or I'd have to downgrade all of my other 5 stars to be fair!!! The only possible negative I can think of  is the price, but it was worth every penny for a special occasion and I'd feel lucky to have the opportunity to experience it again!My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and it couldn't have been better. I have been to a number of 3 michellin star restaurants but this was aboslutely THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE of my life, not only because of the food but because of the service. I often feel uncomfortable with the level of service that goes along with these types of restaurants but they did an excellent job of making our 25-year-old selves feel at home. From the moment you enter, they find out what brings you there and a bit about you. For the rest of the night, every person who served us knew we were from NYC and that it was our anniversary. They had the level of great service without the things that I find to personally be over the top or uncomfortable, e.g. they don't have a person working in the bathroom but they still escorted me to it and opened the door for me when I went. The food: UNREAL. We did 3 courses from the a la carte menu with unbelievable wine pairings. I rarely like wine pairings because I'd rather choose wines that I prefer but the wines that the excellent sommelier recommended not only transformed our meals but we also left with a new favorite dessert wine. Our menu:Boyfriend's starter: Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon poached in a light bisque with a lemongrass and chervil velouté My starter (the BEST foie gras of my life...and I try foie gras pretty much every time its offered): Pressed foie gras with peppered Madeira jelly, smoked duck, new season rhubarb and blood orangeBoyfriend's entree: Suckling pig, crispy belly, roasted loin, homemade sausage, chou farci and braised leg with crushed potatoes and spring onionsMy entree: Fillet of line caught sea basswith cucumber, rock samphire, oyster and caviar sauceBoyfriend's dessert: Smoked chocolate cigar with blood orange and cardamom ice creamMy dessert: Lemonade parfait with honey, bergamot and sheep's milk yoghurt sorbetWe LOVED everything. They were also incredible about my food allergies. They made dairy substitutes where necessary without compromising the integrity of the dish and where they didn't think they could make substitutes (like the oyster & caviar sauce on my fish) they discussed it with me. In the case of the sauce, we decided together to put the sauce on the side so I could put the amount that I thought was good for me. I wasn't planning on not having dairy on a night like this but it definitely improved my experience to have them working out for me. So... definitely go! And definitely make a reservation in advance!

167	5.0	When in London, UK we splurged. Month in advance is required for reservations but I made it 5 months prior, an opportunity i was not going to miss. The Heart of Gordon Ramsay and I was not going to miss to try his food, in his home town. Loved this place. Small, quaint and elegant. As we walked through the doors and sat down at our table we were well taken care of. Three course meal was more than plenty of food, I couldn't have imagine how much food 7 course would have been. Between each course, they would come clean our table from crumbs (very fancy), and each time we had to get up to go to the washroom they walked us to the restroom door and came back to the table to refold our napkin. (very elegant). Lobster Ravoli was to die for, I recommend it! It was mouthwatering.I haven't had a better meal since Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant.	when in london  uk we splurged  month in advance is required for reservations but i made it 5 months prior  an opportunity i was not going to miss  the heart of gordon ramsay and i was not going to miss to try his food  in his home town  loved this place  small  quaint and elegant  as we walked through the doors and sat down at our table we were well taken care of  three course meal was more than plenty of food  i couldn t have imagine how much food 7 course would have been  between each course  they would come clean our table from crumbs  very fancy   and each time we had to get up to go to the washroom they walked us to the restroom door and came back to the table to refold our napkin   very elegant   lobster ravoli was to die for  i recommend it  it was mouthwatering i haven t had a better meal since gordon ramsay s restaurant 
168	5.0	This was our splurge meal during our London stay and I will tell you this, believe the hype.  Most of us know Gordon Ramsay from his various tv shows and people think he's a prick (myself included) but damn, the man has a tremendous restaurant.  There were only 13 tables at this table and the waitstaff was very accommodating.  All white decor and people were dressed well.  We went for lunch which has an excellent 3 course menu (coming in at 45 poounds).  Their regular 3 course lunch menu is 90 pounds and they have a tasting menu coming in at 120 poounds.  I had the 45 pound menu which consisted of an octopus salad with salsa verde, followed by a roasted halibut and dessert.  Everything was so well cooked and delicious.  Presentation was beautiful, service was great and meal was outstanding.  Definitely one of the best meals I've ever had.  Don't go to the other Gordon Ramsay restaurants and just visit this flagship one.  You won't be disappointed.	this was our splurge meal during our london stay and i will tell you this  believe the hype   most of us know gordon ramsay from his various tv shows and people think he s a prick  myself included  but damn  the man has a tremendous restaurant   there were only 13 tables at this table and the waitstaff was very accommodating   all white decor and people were dressed well   we went for lunch which has an excellent 3 course menu  coming in at 45 poounds    their regular 3 course lunch menu is 90 pounds and they have a tasting menu coming in at 120 poounds   i had the 45 pound menu which consisted of an octopus salad with salsa verde  followed by a roasted halibut and dessert   everything was so well cooked and delicious   presentation was beautiful  service was great and meal was outstanding   definitely one of the best meals i ve ever had   don t go to the other gordon ramsay restaurants and just visit this flagship one   you won t be disappointed

171	5.0	Superb!!This was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. Now I understand why Gordon Ramsay cannot stop talking about his Michelin three starred restaurant on TV. First, the restaurant itself is quite small. They only had twelve tables set up when we went and amazingly, each night, they only serve one party per table. So, you can take your time enjoying your magnificent meal. The decor is simple with lots of neutral and clean color. Their excellent service is what truly makes this place stand out. ALL the staff (I mean there are so many people tending to you. There's your main server, then there's the butter guy, water guy, bread guy, wine guy, truffle guy, open-the-restroom-door-for-you guy, etc.) were so polite and friendly. They were not snobby at all. They give complimentary amuse-bouche. One of ours was soft boiled quail eggs wrapped in ham, lightly battered and deep fried (scotch quail eggs). It was perfectly cooked and so cute! For the starter, I had the seared scallop with apples and walnuts. Scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful. All of their main dishes sounded so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish, so I went for it. This is how they describe it on the menu, 'Best end of Cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank, navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes.' So, it's like a tasting menu of 'best of lambs'! Meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes I've ever had. For dessert, we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls, dark chocolate truffles, and rose Turkish delights! We were absolutely well taken care of. The highlight of the dinner was definitely the tour of the kitchen! Kitchen was small but spotless. It was so exciting to see all the action! All in all, it was one darn awesome night!!	superb  this was the best restaurant experience i have ever had  now i understand why gordon ramsay cannot stop talking about his michelin three starred restaurant on tv  first  the restaurant itself is quite small  they only had twelve tables set up when we went and amazingly  each night  they only serve one party per table  so  you can take your time enjoying your magnificent meal  the decor is simple with lots of neutral and clean color  their excellent service is what truly makes this place stand out  all the staff  i mean there are so many people tending to you  there s your main server  then there s the butter guy  water guy  bread guy  wine guy  truffle guy  open the restroom door for you guy  etc   were so polite and friendly  they were not snobby at all  they give complimentary amuse bouche  one of ours was soft boiled quail eggs wrapped in ham  lightly battered and deep fried  scotch quail eggs   it was perfectly cooked and so cute  for the starter  i had the seared scallop with apples and walnuts  scallops were perfectly cooked and the autumney sauce was not over powering at all but very flavorful  all of their main dishes sounded so good  i had a hard time deciding what to get  our server told me his favorite was the lamb dish  so i went for it  this is how they describe it on the menu   best end of cotswold lamb with confit breast and braised shank  navarin of autumn vegetables and vitelotte potatoes   so  it s like a tasting menu of  best of lambs   meat was so tender and it was one of the most beautifully plated dishes i ve ever had  for dessert  we got the chocolate cylinder and apple tart but they also gave us complimentary white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream balls  dark chocolate truffles  and rose turkish delights  we were absolutely well taken care of  the highlight of the dinner was definitely the tour of the kitchen  kitchen was small but spotless  it was so exciting to see all the action  all in all  it was one darn awesome night  
172	5.0	Absolutely perfect.I have never had a better meal in my life than at Gordon Ramsay's. Our table chose the 7 course tasting meal, and everyone was blown away by the flavors, plating, and creativity of each and every piece. At the table were a vegetarian and a vegan, and were easily accommodated, no problem whatsoever. Special plates were made for them, and were served at the same time as everyone elses. I can't recommend this place enough. Be prepared to pay the large bill for an excellent meal. It will take about 6 hours if you are enjoying yourself, which is fine for the amount of money you are paying. Again, if you get the chance, go here!	absolutely perfect i have never had a better meal in my life than at gordon ramsay s  our table chose the 7 course tasting meal  and everyone was blown away by the flavors  plating  and creativity of each and every piece  at the table were a vegetarian and a vegan  and were easily accommodated  no problem whatsoever  special plates were made for them  and were served at the same time as everyone elses  i can t recommend this place enough  be prepared to pay the large bill for an excellent meal  it will take about 6 hours if you are enjoying yourself  which is fine for the amount of money you are paying  again  if you get the chance  go here

174	4.0	"After my mother and I booked our trip to London, we made a reservation at the only Michelin 3-star restaurant in the city.  Two months and various confirmation e-mails and phone calls later, we arrived at this lovely little restaurant on Royal Hospital Road, ready for a treat.We were the first to arrive and were promptly seated at a little table set in crisp white with a centerpiece of white roses in a silver vase.  The space is small and charming, with good light and an aura that evokes mellow wine in gently clinked glasses.The service throughout the meal was phenomenal.  The staff:patron ratio was around 1:1, and various polite and friendly gentlemen attended to our table to welcome us, check on us, clear our crumbs, perfume our feet...okay, that last bit didn't happen, but maybe only because we went with the cheapest menu option?  Our primary waiter was wonderful, charismatic and helpful.  He deserved a blue ribbon for unobtrusive small talk.There were at least five bread options, and we sampled the olive, the baked potato honey, and the rosemary potato.  The best was the rosemary potato, but they were all fresh and yummy with knived dabs from the swirly beehive of yellow butter.  Incidentally, you get a choice of salted and unsalted butter, which I was surprised to note as unusual.The amuse bouche was a tomato consomme with a cute baby-shrimp-sized curl of langoustine accompanied by peas, fava beans, olive oil, and a teeny black cluster of osetra caviar.  It was mild and refreshing.We went with the daily lunch menu priced at £45 a head, with three options for appetizers and entrees, and four for dessert including the cheese plate (with a £3 supplement).  Our waiter indicated that should either of us have any dietary restrictions, the kitchen would be more than happy to accommodate us.I started with the salt cod brandade with Noir de Bigorre ham, poached quail eggs, chargrilled red pepper, olives, and rocket salad.  My mom got the saffron risotto with clams, mussels, langoustines, and tomato, ""paella"" style.  (It was meant to come with chorizo as well, but my mother doesn't eat pork - I know, crazy.)  The brandade was a pleasant blend of pureed cod and potato with a smooth texture enhanced by the meatiness of the fish, great for spreading on the accompanying toasted rosemary crostinis.  The brandade was wrapped in a strip of ham and topped with the quail egg with the veggies and olives nestled on the side.  The olives were excellent on their own and as an accompaniment.  The risotto was beautifully cooked and pretty flavorful, and I imagine it would've been better with chorizo.For our mains, I opted for the roasted saddle of rabbit with sage, Bayonne ham, trompette de la mort, and stuffed Provencal vegetables, and my mom got the fillet of daurade royale with navet, carrot, radish, baby gem lettuce, and artichokes baurigole.  The rabbit was nice, herb-stuffed and wrapped like my starter in yummy fatty pig.  It came with teeny little rabbit kidneys looking all cute and un-organ-like on the side, along with a wonderful stuffed shallot and a wonderful stuffed cherry tomato.  The sublimely juicy vegetables were the elevating component on this plate.  The daurade royale, a simply cooked sea bream in a light creamy sauce, was elegant if unexciting.For dessert we went halfsies on the banana parfait with passion fruit and salted caramel ice cream and the lemon meringue and almond tart with fromage frais sorbet.  The parfait was a block of dry icy reconstituted banana coated with dark chocolate, topped with unmemorable ice cream and sitting atop a meager drizzle of passion fruit.  On the whole, it wasn't awful, but I would've preferred a good commercial dessert.  In fact, the texture wasn't too far off from a very frozen Klondike bar.  The tart was much better, a thing of beauty - circular crust topped with gorgeous layers of lemon curd and nestlike meringue stuck with almond slivers, with narrow strands of caramel sauce leading out from the tart base to a perfect ball of sorbet - and quite delicious to boot, a perfect blend of sweet and sour.After dessert came two splendid extras.  First was a silver tree of spherical silver chocolate truffles.  They were fun to pick off and eat.  The meal ended with strawberry ice cream balls coated with white chocolate, served in a pot smoking with liquid ice.  The ice cream itself was pretty mediocre, but the presentation was so delightful I didn't really care.Overall, I was happy with my experience at Gordon Ramsay, though I wasn't quite wowed.  Other than the banana parfait, everything was great, but nothing was mind-blowing.  Since the place does have the three stars I suppose I was expecting more, but I can't say I didn't enjoy myself.  The food was solid and the service superb.  I probably won't go back as I live abroad but it's worth a try, especially for £45."	after my mother and i booked our trip to london

175	5.0	I went to Gordon Ramsay's last year and I would have to say that it was fine dining at it's best. Chef Claire is at the top of her game! the food was cooked perfectly and delicious. Make sure to order their soufflé, it's one of the best I've ever had period. The staff put in that extra effort,  such as when the waiter entertained my girlfriend while I was in the men's room. After dinner, we were taken on a tour of the kitchen with a photo op in front of the Gordon Ramsay plaque. Thank you so much to the staff at Gordon Ramsay.

178	4.0	Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show. Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills. I came here a while back for the tasting menu.  I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness. Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumble Pan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuce Ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigrette Fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauce Cannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jus Roasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauce Selection of cheeses or pre dessert Pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum Bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite I was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered. I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.	gordon ramsay on royal hospital road  this is definitely one from the archives but which i still feel compelled to blog about  most people either have a positive or negative impression of him  a lot of them commented on his swearing in hell s kitchen  i actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show  lately  he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills  i came here a while back for the tasting menu   i especially liked the second canap s  wafer thin and crispy  it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness  pressed foie gras with madeira jelly  smoked duck  peach and almond crumble pan fried sea scallops from the isle of skye with peas  crispy bacon  quail s eggs  baby gem lettuce ravioli of lobster  langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney  vinaigrette fillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce  leeks and cep sauce cannon of cornish lamb with confit shoulder  ratatouille and thyme jus roasted pigeon from bresse with grilled polenta  smoked pork belly and date sauce selection of cheeses or pre dessert pineapple soup with toasted coconut and rum bitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granite i was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course  with all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around london  i think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered  i hope to see that from gordon ramsay

180	5.0	I may be reinventing the wheel here, given the uniformity of the positive reviews, but when you experience something this wonderful and challenging, you feel inclined to sing it from the rooftops.Truly, this was a standard-setting meal.  Impeccable pacing, interesting, but not fussy food.  Exquisite service, no stuffiness or pretension here.  The restaurant decor is the height of simplicity, all clean lines and white linens, which serve only to highlight the extraordinary, almost-architectural quality of the food. My companion and I went with the £90 a la Carte menu.  Like alcohol, I can never resist sweetbreads, so the foie gras and sweetbreads was a must, and was highlighted by the sweetness of the almond velouté (foam - hand spooned onto my plate - of course).  I went with the sea bass for the main course, which was perfectly cut and cooked and absolutely irresistible.  To finish I went with the Granny Smith parfait with blackberry foam, honeycomb, and cider sorbet - which was structured almost like a Mondrian painting, all right angles, but fantastic.If you have the means, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience.  Quite simply, the best I've ever had.	i may be reinventing the wheel here  given the uniformity of the positive reviews  but when you experience something this wonderful and challenging  you feel inclined to sing it from the rooftops truly  this was a standard setting meal   impeccable pacing  interesting  but not fussy food   exquisite service  no stuffiness or pretension here   the restaurant decor is the height of simplicity  all clean lines and white linens  which serve only to highlight the extraordinary  almost architectural quality of the food  my companion and i went with the  90 a la carte menu   like alcohol  i can never resist sweetbreads  so the foie gras and sweetbreads was a must  and was highlighted by the sweetness of the almond velout   foam   hand spooned onto my plate   of course    i went with the sea bass for the main course  which was perfectly cut and cooked and absolutely irresistible   to finish i went with the granny smith parfait with blackberry foam  honeycomb  and cider sorbet   which was structured almost like a mondrian painting  all right angles  but fantastic if you have the means  please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an amazing dining experience   quite simply  the best i ve ever had 
181	5.0	"My first Michelin 3 star outside of the states.Each establishment I've been to is characterized with an ""experience.""  For example, at Per Se, I felt like I experienced true flavor for the first time in my life.  Gordon Ramsay would be no different.  Recently taking a trip to London, Paris, and Edinburgh for merely a week, my sister and I had our itinerary filled to the rim.  After arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites London has to offer, our dinner reservations were at 930pm.  Having found a Tube station somewhat nearby (according to the maps), we were on our way.  I must have miscalculated the distance, because the journey from the Tube to the restaurant is no joke (at least 20 minutes), however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings.  After a nice stroll through Chelsea, we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant.  There are only 14 tables, so it's small.  The decor I would label as Earth-toned on white with a contemporary flair.  Customarily there were a couple Amuse Bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic.  Instantly I was transferred back into my seat at Per Se when I felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food.  We went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu.  Everything was prepared nicely, with the flavors exploding onto your palate.  Clare Smyth is a marvel hands down.  Our Maitre d' Jean-Claude Breton's charm rivaled only my own.  Of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb.  The meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets, desserts, and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling Gordon Ramsay.  You are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night, and of course a cab is waiting for you outside.From the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab, you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price.  This is fine dining at its most prestige.  I would invite anyone in England to dine here.  Flying out from the states?  Maybe not solely for this reason, but you won't be disappointed.  I'd just take a cab to get there in haste."	my first michelin 3 star outside of the states each establishment i ve been to is characterized with an  experience    for example  at per se  i felt like i experienced true flavor for the first time in my life   gordon ramsay would be no different   recently taking a trip to london  paris  and edinburgh for merely a week  my sister and i had our itinerary filled to the rim   after arriving at 11am and spending the rest of the day seeing the sites london has to offer  our dinner reservations were at 930pm   having found a tube station somewhat nearby  according to the maps   we were on our way   i must have miscalculated the distance  because the journey from the tube to the restaurant is no joke  at least 20 minutes   however it might have been exaggerated due to being unfamiliar to the surroundings   after a nice stroll through chelsea  we were warmly welcomed into the small restaurant   there are only 14 tables  so it s small   the decor i would label as earth toned on white with a contemporary flair   customarily there were a couple amuse bouche compliments of the chef which were fantastic   instantly i was transferred back into my seat at per se when i felt like a new born baby whom had just tasted his first morsel of food   we went for the tastes of the season 7 course menu   everything was prepared nicely  with the flavors exploding onto your palate   clare smyth is a marvel hands down   our maitre d  jean claude breton s charm rivaled only my own   of course he noticed my bow tie and his attention to detail was superb   the meal is concluded with a plethora of sweets  desserts  and nitrogen concoctions unique to the styling gordon ramsay   you are invited to stay as long as socially permitted at the end of the night  and of course a cab is waiting for you outside from the moment you enter to the second you are let off the cab  you are treated with majestic manners fit for a royal for a royal price   this is fine dining at its most prestige   i would invite anyone in england to dine here   flying out from the states   maybe not solely for this reason  but you won t be disappointed   i d just take a cab to get there in haste 
182	4.0	My first Michelin 3 starred experience.  I called about 2 weeks in advanced and was only able to score a 1030 pm table on a weekday.  The wife and I were in town celebrating our 1 year anniversary.  What better place than to go to the place where Gordan Ramsey started it all off.  A decade of 3 Michelin stars is what it advertised on its website.  Truffle season was upon us and they offered a truffle inspired menu.  Our expectations were super high.The food: 1st course: Assiette de legumes: braised en cocotte with Perigord truffles.  A pretty good start.  Essentially a variety of vegetables cooked and shaved truffles.  The truffles had a mild flavor to them, very subtle.2nd: Scottish Langoustine steamed in truffle mousse, linguine and aged parmesan emulsion.  One of my favorites of the night, flavorful and delicate.3rd: Loin of wild Highland venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear and smoked pork belly. A pretty poor transition from the previous dish.  From light and delicate to heavy and gamey.  The flavors were there but slightly overpowering.4th: Livarot wrapped in crispy potato with smoked duck, endive and caper salad, truffle sauce: Probably should have been the 3rd course, It was enjoyable but the previous dish kind of took over.5th: Caramelized blood orange panna cotta: The best panna cotta Ive ever had, period.6th: White chocolate and hazelnut praline mille feuille:  no wow factor but was decent.The various amuse bouches were very tasty.  The thing that stood out was the service, probably the best service Ive ever had in a restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  And for spending 500+ dollars for 2 we were expecting more.	my first michelin 3 starred experience   i called about 2 weeks in advanced and was only able to score a 1030 pm table on a weekday   the wife and i were in town celebrating our 1 year anniversary   what better place than to go to the place where gordan ramsey started it all off   a decade of 3 michelin stars is what it advertised on its website   truffle season was upon us and they offered a truffle inspired menu   our expectations were super high the food  1st course  assiette de legumes  braised en cocotte with perigord truffles   a pretty good start   essentially a variety of vegetables cooked and shaved truffles   the truffles had a mild flavor to them  very subtle 2nd  scottish langoustine steamed in truffle mousse  linguine and aged parmesan emulsion   one of my favorites of the night  flavorful and delicate 3rd  loin of wild highland venison with truffle braised celery  roasted williams pear and smoked pork belly  a pretty poor transition from the previous dish   from light and delicate to heavy and gamey   the flavors were there but slightly overpowering 4th  livarot wrapped in crispy potato with smoked duck  endive and caper salad  truffle sauce  probably should have been the 3rd course  it was enjoyable but the previous dish kind of took over 5th  caramelized blood orange panna cotta  the best panna cotta ive ever had  period 6th  white chocolate and hazelnut praline mille feuille   no wow factor but was decent the various amuse bouches were very tasty   the thing that stood out was the service  probably the best service ive ever had in a restaurant  the food was good  but not great   and for spending 500  dollars for 2 we were expecting more 
183	5.0	Until now, Gary Danko in SF has been my favorite overall spot...until I came to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in London. My girlfriend and I were the first ones in on a Monday night, so it was a bit quiet - but the restaurant (all of the 15 tables or so there) filled up pretty quickly. The service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in NY - you get attention from virtually every waiter, and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu. A note - I am not sure what goes for 'dressy' in the UK, but the website (at least when I visited it), strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear. And every other guy there was wearing one when we went...so better to be overdressed than underdressed, right?We both got the 7-course tasting menu (unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don't want to shell , do this), which was absolutely delicious. First was a roll with lobster, langoustine, and avocado - absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small, fresh pieces of tender seafood. Also served on the house were soft-boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside (they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store) and a cracker with salami inside (tasty!). The amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme, which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night (but was still very delicious).The main course - fantastic. You get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly. I've had foie gras pate before that I was not a fan of, but this was out of this world. The combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together...wow. Second course was seafood ravioli (lobster and langoustine). As with all of the dishes, they aren't large, but you savor each bite, and this tasted great, particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters (note: the waiters added some kind of sauce, for both food presentation and taste, for almost every dish). The turbot, a fish I don't think I've had before (at least by this name) was delicious - a meatier fish that had 'chicken juice' poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate. My only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon (hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets) instead of the lamb, which my girlfriend got. The pigeon was good - very smoky flavor - but the meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked. The lamb was outstanding from the bites I had, and I would recommend it if you're going to do the menu. The cheese selection (I don't know much about cheese, so I let the waiter pick a selection of 5) was delicious but a bit big if you're parsimonious on the cracker-to-cheese ratio: the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done. The creme brulee (my girlfriend's selection) was very light, but the highlight is the shot of apple juice (or smoothie, perhaps more appropriately) that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert. The mango/passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher, but is a little small to warrant being an entire course. The last dessert was delicious, but since I was too far in food heaven by this point, I forget right off what it was (aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it).Since it was my girlfriend's birthday, we also got 3 more desserts - a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache (so rich and so freakin' good...blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces), pieces of Turkish Delight (the weakest link of the extra desserts, but still very good), and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate (like a bite-sized ice cream bar, except way better) that was frozen with dry ice...freakin' awesome.This put a hurtin' on the wallet (the US conversion came out to $500), but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life. Now I know what 3 Michelin stars tastes like...it tastes delicious and is full of epic win.	until now  gary danko in sf has been my favorite overall spot   until i came to gordon ramsay s restaurant in london  my girlfriend and i were the first ones in on a monday night  so it was a bit quiet   but the restaurant  all of the 15 tables or so there  filled up pretty quickly  the service is much better than most of the upscale restaurants in ny   you get attention from virtually every waiter  and they all are quite knowledgeable about the items on the menu  a note   i am not sure what goes for  dressy  in the uk  but the website  at least when i visited it   strongly implied that a jacket was a good choice for men to wear  and every other guy there was wearing one when we went   so better to be overdressed than underdressed  right we both got the 7 course tasting menu  unless you feel strongly about ordering your own dishes or don t want to shell   do this   which was absolutely delicious  first was a roll with lobster  langoustine  and avocado   absolutely a perfect match of a slightly heavier veggie with small  fresh pieces of tender seafood  also served on the house were soft boiled quail eggs that were lightly fried on the outside  they have a richer flavor than the regular eggs from the grocery store  and a cracker with salami inside  tasty    the amuse bouche was langoustine in a tomato consumme  which was probably one of the more unremarkable dishes of the night  but was still very delicious  the main course   fantastic  you get started off with pressed foie gras topped with jelly  i ve had foie gras pate before that i was not a fan of  but this was out of this world  the combination with the peach had all the flavors working amazingly together   wow  second course was seafood ravioli  lobster and langoustine   as with all of the dishes  they aren t large  but you savor each bite  and this tasted great  particularly with the sauce that was added by the waiters  note  the waiters added some kind of sauce  for both food presentation and taste  for almost every dish   the turbot  a fish i don t think i ve had before  at least by this name  was delicious   a meatier fish that had  chicken juice  poured on top that really accentuated the texture of the plate  my only mistake of the meal was ordering the pigeon  hopefully not the ones frequenting the city streets  instead of the lamb  which my girlfriend got  the pigeon was good   very smoky flavor   but the meat was a bit tougher than i would have liked  the lamb was outstanding from the bites i had  and i would recommend it if you re going to do the menu  the cheese selection  i don t know much about cheese  so i let the waiter pick a selection of 5  was delicious but a bit big if you re parsimonious on the cracker to cheese ratio  the waiters came around and asked me a few times if i was done  the creme brulee  my girlfriend s selection  was very light  but the highlight is the shot of apple juice  or smoothie  perhaps more appropriately  that adds a blast of fruitiness to the dessert  the mango passion fruit with whip cream is a nice refresher  but is a little small to warrant being an entire course  the last dessert was delicious  but since i was too far in food heaven by this point  i forget right off what it was  aside from having delicious fruit sorbet in it  since it was my girlfriend s birthday  we also got 3 more desserts   a box with pieces of pure chocolate ganache  so rich and so freakin  good   blows away the chocolate shops that sell individual pieces   pieces of turkish delight  the weakest link of the extra desserts  but still very good   and pieces of strawberry ice cream covered with frozen chocolate  like a bite sized ice cream bar  except way better  that was frozen with dry ice   freakin  awesome this put a hurtin  on the wallet  the us conversion came out to  500   but you have to have a food experience like this at least once in your life  now i know what 3 michelin stars tastes like   it tastes delicious and is full of epic win 
184	4.0	We took the opportunity of being in London to try this highly rated restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. Having tried other 3 michelin star restaurants in New York such as Daniel and George, we had pretty high expectations for our visit. First the 5 star good: service was impeccable, staff were both knowledgable and organized with great attention to detail. Food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus. The four stars: we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment, i.e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date. Price wise we thought as well that it was a little high for the overall lunch experience vs a tasting menu even dinner at other three michelin star restaurants in New York.	we took the opportunity of being in london to try this highly rated restaurant of gordon ramsay  having tried other 3 michelin star restaurants in new york such as daniel and george  we had pretty high expectations for our visit  first the 5 star good  service was impeccable  staff were both knowledgable and organized with great attention to detail  food was amazing though we thought the quality had been better in other 3 michelin restaurants though those had been dinners and tasting menus  the four stars  we thought the ambience was a tad of a disappointment  i e we had expected some more privacy and exclusivity than being in a dining hall which was a little awkward when food takes time to prepare and you are trying to focus on having a good conversation with your date  price wise we thought as well that it was a little high for the overall lunch experience vs a tasting menu even dinner at other three michelin star restaurants in new york

We sat at a window table and had the ""surprise me"" wine pairing with dinner. My Wife chose the Prestige menu and I the Seasonal Inspiration. The food was amazing, the service was flawless, and the atmosphere romantic and comfortable. At the end of the evening, we asked for a list of the wines that were paired with our meals, and by the time we arrived back in the US an email with everyone had arrived. (Thank you Sharon!) I can say with confidence I would recommend this restaurant."	 this restaurant is an amazing experience  this was the first time that my wife or i had ever been in london or dined in a gordon ramsay restaurant  we sat at a window table and had the  surprise me  wine pairing with dinner  my wife chose the prestige menu and i the seasonal inspiration  the food was amazing  the service was flawless  and the atmosphere romantic and comfortable  at the end of the evening  we asked for a list of the wines that were paired with our meals  and by the time we arrived back in the us an email with everyone had arrived   thank you sharon   i can say with confidence i would recommend this restaurant 
187	4.0	On our trip we sampled the cuisines of Joel Robuchon, the Ledbury, Maze, Hélèn Darroze, Alain Ducasse, Lucas Carton, Pierre Gagnaire and Gordon Ramsey's Hospital Rd restaurant. The food at his restaurant was truly exceptional and, up until the end of the meal, the service excellent. However, at the end of the meal a young lady of Asian features with red painted nails brought the card reader for us to pay our bill. She stared into my guest's eyes for several moments, shrugged her eyebrows and broke into a seemingly contrived long laugh. This terribly rude behavior made my guest extremely uncomfortable and sadly became her most vivid recollection of our dinner at Gordon Ramsey's flagship restaurant! For that reason I have only given the restaurant four stars and that may be generous.	on our trip we sampled the cuisines of joel robuchon  the ledbury  maze  h l n darroze  alain ducasse  lucas carton  pierre gagnaire and gordon ramsey s hospital rd restaurant  the food at his restaurant was truly exceptional and  up until the end of the meal  the service excellent  however  at the end of the meal a young lady of asian features with red painted nails brought the card reader for us to pay our bill  she stared into my guest s eyes for several moments  shrugged her eyebrows and broke into a seemingly contrived long laugh  this terribly rude behavior made my guest extremely uncomfortable and sadly became her most vivid recollection of our dinner at gordon ramsey s flagship restaurant  for that reason i have only given the restaurant four stars and that may be generous

 Then some finger sweets like Turkish delights and chocolates at the end.  So if I'm not forgetting anything, it's basically seven ""courses"" ... the portions may seem small upon appearance, but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied.I'd recommend this to everyone, but the price tag is no joke.  90 quid each for the a la carte.  Yikes."	i have really wanted to go here for quite some time   i ll admit it  his celebrity fame brought my attention to the restaurant but let s be honest    that s how most of us found out about this guy i booked what i thought was plenty ahead of time  but realized there were very few choices left   it seems to me that they only book one per table a night  but you get to choose the time   my friend and i were in the first time slot at 6 30  but many guests were already seated when we arrived   the entire experience takes a good 2  hours so plan for that   there are about ten or twelve tables in a room that was much smaller than i thought   the decor is really nice   not overwhelming and inviting the staff is pretty ridiculous   i think we sifted through at least 12 different people while we were there   not a single dedicated waiter  and everyone took turns refilling water    you will be lucky if you get past a couple centimeters without a refill   but the staff is incredibly friendly and not annoying at all   they do leave you alone during your meal but are very attentive and can smell the slightest bit of concern and are willing to fulfill your needs   only one of the staff members bothered me   he seemed like a french pretentious high class hipster or something  but in a funny way   another staff member looked like the muscle straight out of russia in case anything went awry  he was cool   overall  very friendly and courteous staff the food    without a doubt the best i ve ever had   three stars isn t kidding around   i had a three course meal   scallops  lamb  and souffle   we were given two separate starters  some sort of hors d oeuvre finger foods that were amazing  followed by some sort of tomato based soup  but not like you think   the broth was clear and served with some baby vegetables and prawns i believe   very small  just a taste   the scallops were so good  i could eat that as my meal   best i ve ever had   the lamb was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing   i had a bite of my friend s beef  and i thought it was better than the lamb  but now i m being picky   both were delicious   before dessert we were given these mango coolies of some kind with glass straws   very refreshing   the souffle i had  the only one i ever had  was of the banana variety and incredible   i m not a dessert man at all  but it was freaking good   then some finger sweets like turkish delights and chocolates at the end   so if i m not forgetting anything  it s basically seven  courses      the portions may seem small upon appearance  but when you are finished with everything you leave perfectly satisfied i d recommend this to everyone  but the price tag is no joke   90 quid each for the a la carte   yikes 
189	5.0	We hadn't eaten here for years, and had forgotten just how good it really is.  There is amazing attention to detail from the staff, between the restaurant and the kitchen it;s virtually a one to one ratio between staff and diners.  It's recently been refurbished, and for thee Michelin stars it's far from stuffy.  We were eating from the three course lunch menu, but even so we were offered a fantastic pre-starter of pea and mint infused ricotta with edible flowers. It was so light and fluffy you would barely know it was cheese.  I then had the warm summer vegetable salad, and my husband the smoked mackerel salad.  We both opted for the roast cod, which was perfectly cooked, slightly translucent still in the middle.  I had the roast pineapple with coconut sorbet, which was superb.  My husband opted for the safety of the cheeseboard.  After the meal we were offered elderflower jellies, flash frozen white chocolate and strawberry, and peanut brittle dark chocolate.  We left very, very happy.  Why on earth had we left it so long?	we hadn t eaten here for years  and had forgotten just how good it really is   there is amazing attention to detail from the staff  between the restaurant and the kitchen it s virtually a one to one ratio between staff and diners   it s recently been refurbished  and for thee michelin stars it s far from stuffy   we were eating from the three course lunch menu  but even so we were offered a fantastic pre starter of pea and mint infused ricotta with edible flowers  it was so light and fluffy you would barely know it was cheese   i then had the warm summer vegetable salad  and my husband the smoked mackerel salad   we both opted for the roast cod  which was perfectly cooked  slightly translucent still in the middle   i had the roast pineapple with coconut sorbet  which was superb   my husband opted for the safety of the cheeseboard   after the meal we were offered elderflower jellies  flash frozen white chocolate and strawberry  and peanut brittle dark chocolate   we left very  very happy   why on earth had we left it so long

The ambience, atmosphere, service, wine, etc are all excellent, but the food, which is what matters, didn't knock me out. The food itself isn't that expensive, you do get stung with drinks (me and my grandad's brandys, especially!).

191	5.0	Came here for dinner. We had the traditional tasting menu. The staff were very welcoming and friendly upon arrival and throughout the meal. Service was flawless. The sommelier helped choose wine pairings in accordance to what the customer likes. Rather than at Alain Ducasse where the by the glass option consists of the sommelier telling you that he's chosen out a wine pairing that goes well with the meal, in which you do not know what the wines are, or how much it costs (a lot).Everything on the menu, including the little extra dishes they brought out, tasted amazing and the presentation was spectacular.I definitely plan to go back here	came here for dinner  we had the traditional tasting menu  the staff were very welcoming and friendly upon arrival and throughout the meal  service was flawless  the sommelier helped choose wine pairings in accordance to what the customer likes  rather than at alain ducasse where the by the glass option consists of the sommelier telling you that he s chosen out a wine pairing that goes well with the meal  in which you do not know what the wines are  or how much it costs  a lot  everything on the menu  including the little extra dishes they brought out  tasted amazing and the presentation was spectacular i definitely plan to go back here
192	5.0	Being a paragon of refinement and class, I nearly had to send back my wine glass due to water spots. I mean, where were we...Le Gavroche? (insert posh laugh here)Seriously though, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is amazing. The food was nearly perfect as my hot date (and generous patron) and I had the scallops, foie gras, sea bass and duck. All rated among the finest I've ever sampled - I doubt you could go wrong anywhere on the menu.This may sound weird, but the service was really the highlight for me. The pacing of the meal and the knowledge of the staff complemented the food, drink and slick atmosphere. There's nothing worse than going for a posh meal and having it ruined by an uninformed, oversolicitous or inattentive waiter. After a quick tour of the kitchen we did have a bit of awkward interaction with the front of the house in getting them to bring us the bill, but any slight annoyance was forgotten with a sculpture of chocolate truffles.Certainly you won't decide whether or not to go to RGR based on a Yelp review, but Jesus H. Christmas is this place worth it. Do yourself a favour and grab a table - best 2.5 hour lunch you'll ever have.	being a paragon of refinement and class  i nearly had to send back my wine glass due to water spots  i mean  where were we   le gavroche   insert posh laugh here seriously though  restaurant gordon ramsay is amazing  the food was nearly perfect as my hot date  and generous patron  and i had the scallops  foie gras  sea bass and duck  all rated among the finest i ve ever sampled   i doubt you could go wrong anywhere on the menu this may sound weird  but the service was really the highlight for me  the pacing of the meal and the knowledge of the staff complemented the food  drink and slick atmosphere  there s nothing worse than going for a posh meal and having it ruined by an uninformed  oversolicitous or inattentive waiter  after a quick tour of the kitchen we did have a bit of awkward interaction with the front of the house in getting them to bring us the bill  but any slight annoyance was forgotten with a sculpture of chocolate truffles certainly you won t decide whether or not to go to rgr based on a yelp review  but jesus h  christmas is this place worth it  do yourself a favour and grab a table   best 2 5 hour lunch you ll ever have

Anyway...When I was here, we got the tasting menu, which is basically around seven courses of small portions, chosen by the chef. I managed to annoy everyone by flaunting my vegetarianism, and thus meaning I had a little menu of my own. But hey, why even be vegetarian if it doesn't annoy someone?The food was AMAZING. Just perfect. The ingredients, the presentation, the taste, everything was just fantastic. The service was exceptional, but that may well be because we'd ordered the tasting menu, and were thus something of a priority. The wine list was fantastic, as was the pre-seating bar, and I must admit that I was GOOD and drunk by the time the later courses rolled around. The friendliness of the staff is also note worthy. We were allowed into the kitchen to watch the chefs at work, were given the time to have a quick chat with the head chef, and I was given a French cookbook I'd been reading in the bar simply because I asked where I could buy it from. The head chef also signed the inside of the book. A fantastic meal out. But REALLY expensive.

This is what you would call a true ""dining experience""...one that is unmatched in my opinion. Sure it's pricey, but you get to have an experience you won't soon forget. It would only be more awesome if you could hear Chef Ramsay cursing from the kitchen...but I digress.

198	5.0	"The splurge of a lifetime for a meal, to be sure...but nonetheless, Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations.It's a beautiful restaurant with only 14 tables, so very intimate. Everyone serves everyone. They not only serve, they chat. They constantly circle the room. It's almost dizzying if it weren't so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal.The first thing, a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box. It had a couple of truffles in it, and he showed it to us and let us smell them. This was their ""feature"" item of the night. Then another man came and chatted with us. He asked what made us choose to visit and I said it was the highlight of my trip; and that I booked it because I watch all the Ramsay shows and this was to treat myself. I got the 7-course tasting menu. There were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises. My daughter decided to have the 3-course menu, which meant she got full-sized servings, but also many of my surprises. Hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and I misunderstood: It wasn't 40 pounds for the entrée...it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entrée! Oh my! Good news is that she loved it. Bad news is, the whole dinner cost ~$500 US dollars. Still, it exceeded my expectations.One woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties: Wheat, white, olive, rosemary, etc. They asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft, perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table.I am not remembering it all, but I wrote down what I could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel. It was something like this:1. Surprise x3 for both of us: A plate with 3 mini appetizers on it.      a. Crab and avocado filling in a mini cone     b. Mini quail Scottish egg     c. Cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it2. Amouse bouche (spelling catastrophe): Duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup.3. Veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois (to die for!)4. Some white bean and Scottish mini mushrooms with Cornish turbot (white fish)5. Lobster, salmon and langoustine ravioli (this was my daughter's appetizer, so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses, so I got a slightly smaller version)6. My main dish: Cotswold lamb and veggies (I forget the details). My daughter's main dish: Pasta with truffle!7. My dessert: Some special Agen prune crème brûlée with Granny Smith apple juice. Yummy! My daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet. They came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice. It was impressive but the photo does it no justice.8. Extra: We both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers9. Surprise for both of us:     a. Strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice     b. Chocolate truffle bites     c. Lavender gelatin squares (this was the only thing that wasn't too tasty)So when all that was said and done, one of the waiters came over and asked me if I'd like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought I might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen! Totally cool. So he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated. It was spectacular. The whole evening exceeded all my expectations! One for the memory books for sure..."	the splurge of a lifetime for a meal  to be sure   but nonetheless  gordon ramsay exceeded my expectations it s a beautiful restaurant with only 14 tables  so very intimate  everyone serves everyone  they not only serve  they chat  they constantly circle the room  it s almost dizzying if it weren t so phenomenal and well orchestrated and personal the first thing  a man walked up with what looked like a lidded cigar box  it had a couple of truffles in it  and he showed it to us and let us smell them  this was their  feature  item of the night  then another man came and chatted with us  he asked what made us choose to visit and i said it was the highlight of my trip  and that i booked it because i watch all the ramsay shows and this was to treat myself  i got the 7 course tasting menu  there were more than 7 courses though because they served up all sorts of extra surprises  my daughter decided to have the 3 course menu  which meant she got full sized servings  but also many of my surprises  hers actually cost more than mine because she got the pasta special with shaved truffle on top and i misunderstood  it wasn t 40 pounds for the entr e   it was 40 pounds extra just for the truffle shavings on top of the pasta entr e  oh my  good news is that she loved it  bad news is  the whole dinner cost   500 us dollars  still  it exceeded my expectations one woman came back throughout the evening with a tray of fresh bread slices of about 5 varieties  wheat  white  olive  rosemary  etc  they asked if you wanted salted or unsalted butter and then proceeded to put a super soft  perfectly round ball of said butter on a slate slab on our table i am not remembering it all  but i wrote down what i could remember as soon as we got back to our hotel  it was something like this 1  surprise x3 for both of us  a plate with 3 mini appetizers on it       a  crab and avocado filling in a mini cone     b  mini quail scottish egg     c  cracker with prosciutto or some sort of nice salami in it2  amouse bouche  spelling catastrophe   duck and parmesan fried ball in chestnut soup 3  veal sweetbreads and sauteed foie grois  to die for  4  some white bean and scottish mini mushrooms with cornish turbot  white fish 5  lobster  salmon and langoustine ravioli  this was my daughter s appetizer  so she got an extra large version and it was one of my 7 courses  so i got a slightly smaller version 6  my main dish  cotswold lamb and veggies  i forget the details   my daughter s main dish  pasta with truffle 7  my dessert  some special agen prune cr me br l e with granny smith apple juice  yummy  my daughter got an assortment of ice creams and sorbet  they came as small scoops on top of a brick of ice  it was impressive but the photo does it no justice 8  extra  we both then got mango smoothies as palette cleansers9  surprise for both of us      a  strawberry ice cream bon bons with white chocolate coating on dry ice     b  chocolate truffle bites     c  lavender gelatin squares  this was the only thing that wasn t too tasty so when all that was said and done  one of the waiters came over and asked me if i d like to see the kitchen since they had filmed back there before and he thought i might enjoy seeing the inner workings of their kitchen  totally cool  so he escorted me and my daughter back to the kitchen where we met the executive chefs and they showed us all the stations and explained how they operated  it was spectacular  the whole evening exceeded all my expectations  one for the memory books for sure

We had a few courses, some dessert and we left full and happy.

The food and staff were exceptional and it definitely deserves a 5 star. But it is only for special occasions not for a everyday dinner because it is very expensive.	it is very hard to find a table in there so you have to book in advance for at least two weeks  we went there for a special occasion for my brother s birthday  the food and staff were exceptional and it definitely deserves a 5 star  but it is only for special occasions not for a everyday dinner because it is very expensive

203	5.0	A couple of years ago, I celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant Gordon Ramsay.The first experience was trying to get a booking: not easy. If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am. We couldn't get the exact day we wanted, and had to settle for a 10:15pm slot!Nevertheless, it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around.The restaurant is just one room, and not more than ten tables or so. It's white, surprisingly (to me) bright, and not that fancy. The focus is on the food.The menu was full of incredible choices. I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end.While very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined. Can't say enough about the staff: attentive, upscale, but chatty and helpful.The price was, obviously, immense. You know what you're getting into when you come here. If you're trying to treat someone, they have two menus, one with prices and one without.If you can get in, and you've saved your pennies to splurge for (for most of us) a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Gordon Ramsay's delivered for us.Did my girlfriend enjoy the experience? Well, she's now my wife.	a couple of years ago  i celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant gordon ramsay the first experience was trying to get a booking  not easy  if you re not a celebrity  you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you d like to go  you can only book 2 months  or 3  i forget  in advance  and it s so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am  we couldn t get the exact day we wanted  and had to settle for a 10 15pm slot nevertheless  it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around the restaurant is just one room  and not more than ten tables or so  it s white  surprisingly  to me  bright  and not that fancy  the focus is on the food the menu was full of incredible choices  i don t remember now what each course was  but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite  as with this type of food  portions aren t huge  but there were a few rounds of amouse bouches  and amusing they were  especially the bacon and eggs one  between courses that actually made us full at the end while very classy  the serving staff didn t make you feel stupid if you weren t an expert at which utensil to use next  the sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36 page     wine list  some special  recently obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box  but we declined  can t say enough about the staff  attentive  upscale  but chatty and helpful the price was  obviously  immense  you know what you re getting into when you come here  if you re trying to treat someone  they have two menus  one with prices and one without if you can get in  and you ve saved your pennies to splurge for  for most of us  a once in a lifetime meal  gordon ramsay s delivered for us did my girlfriend enjoy the experience  well  she s now my wife 
204	5.0	The partner & I love this place -- we go for his birthday, my birthday, our anniversary... and any other occasion we drum up for a treat to ourselves from time to time. On a slightly negative note, let me just say that none of the other GR restaurants in London compare. I find Claridges particularly disappointing. Everything I have to say about the RHRoad restaurant is highly complimentary. J-C is incredible -- he could sell me a worn shoe for a main course and I would devour it eagerly. The man is charm incarnate. There appears to be some turnover in other staff, but overall the service is irreproachable. The ambience is muted and unimposing. The seafood ravioli is to die for. For the mains, we tend to order the beef or ox cheeks whenever available. Note the restaurant is extremely accomodating on the tasting menu -- we were there a few weeks ago, made two substitutions and the waiter did not bat an eye. And how can anyone not love a restaurant that serves trees of chocolate balls and strawberry ice cream in dry ice???	the partner   i love this place    we go for his birthday  my birthday  our anniversary    and any other occasion we drum up for a treat to ourselves from time to time  on a slightly negative note  let me just say that none of the other gr restaurants in london compare  i find claridges particularly disappointing  everything i have to say about the rhroad restaurant is highly complimentary  j c is incredible    he could sell me a worn shoe for a main course and i would devour it eagerly  the man is charm incarnate  there appears to be some turnover in other staff  but overall the service is irreproachable  the ambience is muted and unimposing  the seafood ravioli is to die for  for the mains  we tend to order the beef or ox cheeks whenever available  note the restaurant is extremely accomodating on the tasting menu    we were there a few weeks ago  made two substitutions and the waiter did not bat an eye  and how can anyone not love a restaurant that serves trees of chocolate balls and strawberry ice cream in dry ice   
205	5.0	When I think of a perfect dinner the first place that comes to my mind is this restaurant. From the very moment we entered this place we were greeted and our coats taken. We were seated promptly, just taking the atmosphere was a treat as well. We both ordered our appetizers and were gobsmacked by the level of perfection. I had the quail and my date had the artichoke to start off  perfectly cooked and at a temperature that made me forget it was just cooked! The main course was decadent I having the pork and my date had the chicken I think (I don't remember hers exactly). I had a Portugese wine accompanying the main course which was superb as well. Finally the dessert came I had a cheese cart and my date had the Belgian chocolates. We were disappointed to even go it felt like a passing dream we wanted more of. The cost was high a whopping 183 pounds but well worth it, to this day I still keep the receipt in my wallet to remind me of how superb service should be! Next time I am in London I will definitely be coming back here for another round!	when i think of a perfect dinner the first place that comes to my mind is this restaurant  from the very moment we entered this place we were greeted and our coats taken  we were seated promptly  just taking the atmosphere was a treat as well  we both ordered our appetizers and were gobsmacked by the level of perfection  i had the quail and my date had the artichoke to start off  perfectly cooked and at a temperature that made me forget it was just cooked  the main course was decadent i having the pork and my date had the chicken i think  i don t remember hers exactly   i had a portugese wine accompanying the main course which was superb as well  finally the dessert came i had a cheese cart and my date had the belgian chocolates  we were disappointed to even go it felt like a passing dream we wanted more of  the cost was high a whopping 183 pounds but well worth it  to this day i still keep the receipt in my wallet to remind me of how superb service should be  next time i am in london i will definitely be coming back here for another round 
206	5.0	Phenomenal, outstanding, incredible. That could be all of my review, but I will expand :) This is the 3 Michelin star Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Therefore, I cannot stress enough how incredibly good the food is. A 3 Michelin star experience is something I would recommend to anyone for a special occassion. Most people go to this type of restaurant for an anniversary or a special birthday, etc. From beginning to end the experience was unique. The maitre was a French man that made us feel comfortable and was attentive to our every need, like all the waiters and waitresses. If anything, there was one French waiter that had a very strong accent and I could not really understand. That was the only 'negative' thing I could highlight of the night :) There are different menus to choose from and we chose the £90 for 3 course menu. To start with, they brought some small appetizers for us to try that were not part of the menu, and then we continued with the 3 courses, all of this accompanied with gorgeous different breads and some wine. Then we were taken to the kitchen and were introduced to the head chef and could see how all the chefs were preparing the dishes. That was very special indeed. Finally, we were taken to a small and romantic table outside the reception area where we were given some white chocolate truffles to finish the night in style. I can positively say that this is the best restaurant experience I have ever had and it was worth every penny. I will be back, hopefully!	phenomenal  outstanding  incredible  that could be all of my review  but i will expand    this is the 3 michelin star gordon ramsay restaurant  therefore  i cannot stress enough how incredibly good the food is  a 3 michelin star experience is something i would recommend to anyone for a special occassion  most people go to this type of restaurant for an anniversary or a special birthday  etc  from beginning to end the experience was unique  the maitre was a french man that made us feel comfortable and was attentive to our every need  like all the waiters and waitresses  if anything  there was one french waiter that had a very strong accent and i could not really understand  that was the only  negative  thing i could highlight of the night    there are different menus to choose from and we chose the  90 for 3 course menu  to start with  they brought some small appetizers for us to try that were not part of the menu  and then we continued with the 3 courses  all of this accompanied with gorgeous different breads and some wine  then we were taken to the kitchen and were introduced to the head chef and could see how all the chefs were preparing the dishes  that was very special indeed  finally  we were taken to a small and romantic table outside the reception area where we were given some white chocolate truffles to finish the night in style  i can positively say that this is the best restaurant experience i have ever had and it was worth every penny  i will be back  hopefully

WOWI took my girlfriend and had the Menu Prestige at £120 per head. Yes it is expensive but if you want to treat someone, or eat somewhere special, this place is amazing on every front.

208	5.0	"This place is stunning and a must do.Bring a credit card with a very healthy limit!  I used the online booking system...and typically, only 1700 or 2130 were available.  Service is impeccable starting from when they greet you at the door by name.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food, its preparation, and are more than willing to make recommendations that are spot on.You have a choice between three courses for 90 pounds, Menu Prestige 6-7 courses (depending how you look at it) for 120 pounds, or their Truffle Inspiration seasonal special of five courses for 175 pounds.  I chose the three courses and a special starter for that night...which was duck breast I think in puff pastry...but forget about that and go right for the fois gras--OMG...I know it's not politically correct to like fois gras these days, but this was probably the best slice that I've had.  It melted in your mouth.  The sommelier had recommended a glass of German pinot noir (Ziereisen) which was surprisingly exceptional...who knew?!?!  For the main, I chose the loin of wild Highland Venison with truffle braised celery, roasted Williams pear, and smoked pork belly.  Divine!  The third course is dessert...and yet, after dessert, they bring out all these little treats that others have mentioned.  You almost don't really need to order dessert.  All totaled, I spent 170 pounds.  C'est la vie!!!!  What sets this place apart is the attention to detail.  The sommelier wrote out each of the wines I had had and placed in an evelope for me to take with me.  Since the receipt only said, ""A La Carte"", I asked for someone to write out what I had had for each course so that I could remember it later.  They presented me with a very nice copy of their take away menu that they had the head chef sign.  Impressive and suitable for framing. A wonderful experience and I can't think of anything they could have done better."	this place is stunning and a must do bring a credit card with a very healthy limit   i used the online booking system   and typically  only 1700 or 2130 were available   service is impeccable starting from when they greet you at the door by name   the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food  its preparation  and are more than willing to make recommendations that are spot on you have a choice between three courses for 90 pounds  menu prestige 6 7 courses  depending how you look at it  for 120 pounds  or their truffle inspiration seasonal special of five courses for 175 pounds   i chose the three courses and a special starter for that night   which was duck breast i think in puff pastry   but forget about that and go right for the fois gras  omg   i know it s not politically correct to like fois gras these days  but this was probably the best slice that i ve had   it melted in your mouth   the sommelier had recommended a glass of german pinot noir  ziereisen  which was surprisingly exceptional   who knew      for the main  i chose the loin of wild highland venison with truffle braised celery  roasted williams pear  and smoked pork belly   divine   the third course is dessert   and yet  after dessert  they bring out all these little treats that others have mentioned   you almost don t really need to order dessert   all totaled  i spent 170 pounds   c est la vie      what sets this place apart is the attention to detail   the sommelier wrote out each of the wines i had had and placed in an evelope for me to take with me   since the receipt only said   a la carte   i asked for someone to write out what i had had for each course so that i could remember it later   they presented me with a very nice copy of their take away menu that they had the head chef sign   impressive and suitable for framing  a wonderful experience and i can t think of anything they could have done better

210	4.0	Interesting to see how many of the existing reviews are from Americans (myself being one of them).  I think it's definitely worth trying once - the service is definitely at a completely different level.  How many waiters do you need to serve a table of 4 (apparently 3!)?  The food was really good but at least in my mind, forgettable.  To get a full 5 stars, the food would need to leave an indelible mark in my memory.	interesting to see how many of the existing reviews are from americans  myself being one of them    i think it s definitely worth trying once   the service is definitely at a completely different level   how many waiters do you need to serve a table of 4  apparently 3     the food was really good but at least in my mind  forgettable   to get a full 5 stars  the food would need to leave an indelible mark in my memory 
211	5.0	BEST SERVICE EVER! Me and mum came here right after we got off the plane. As all the comments below have said, it was PERFECT. The food, the drinks, the dessert, the service, everything. You really have to be there to know what I mean. Honestly, after eating here, no service will ever be food enough. There are probably just as many waiters and waitresses as the number of people dining there. Though it may seem pricey, it really was worth it. Everything was served beautifully, and the waiters were very knowledgeable. They were able to give explanations and descriptions of each dish. Just when you thought you were done, the dessert just blows your mind. We got assiette de l'aubergine (every dessert  for two). AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL! I loved loved lovedddd the Soufflet. IT WAS SO GOOD! But I mean, everything was good. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Probably not a huge group (because the bill would scare you) but it was one amazing experience. Too bad I forgot to tour the kitchen.. I forgot to... but this is somewhere you must eat if you're in London.	best service ever  me and mum came here right after we got off the plane  as all the comments below have said  it was perfect  the food  the drinks  the dessert  the service  everything  you really have to be there to know what i mean  honestly  after eating here  no service will ever be food enough  there are probably just as many waiters and waitresses as the number of people dining there  though it may seem pricey  it really was worth it  everything was served beautifully  and the waiters were very knowledgeable  they were able to give explanations and descriptions of each dish  just when you thought you were done  the dessert just blows your mind  we got assiette de l aubergine  every dessert  for two   and it was beautiful  i loved loved lovedddd the soufflet  it was so good  but i mean  everything was good  i would recommend this to anyone and everyone  probably not a huge group  because the bill would scare you  but it was one amazing experience  too bad i forgot to tour the kitchen   i forgot to    but this is somewhere you must eat if you re in london 
212	5.0	my friend and i are doing 5 michelin star restaurants in one week because we are spoiled kids. this is restaurant #4/5.when i tasted the pork belly, i think i just made an incoherent sound like 'hukk!!' which translated means, this is the best pork i've ever had. it was brilliant. definitely five stars on yelp, definitely 10 years of 3 star michelin rating deserved.service was good of course- especially when i asked for madeleines on a course thing i didn't order (but was willing to pay extra for them) they just said they will bring them out, and they were baked fresh, and were the best madeleines ever. the dessert- banana parfait was not really my thing. of course delicious, but not as good as i expected. loved the surprises between and after courses ;) i'll leave that as a surprise.alain ducasse, i felt more pampered but the main course was better here. it also came out to be more expensive,since no wine, water, or tea included in teh menu so we were surprised to be charged all those things.	my friend and i are doing 5 michelin star restaurants in one week because we are spoiled kids  this is restaurant  4 5 when i tasted the pork belly  i think i just made an incoherent sound like  hukk    which translated means  this is the best pork i ve ever had  it was brilliant  definitely five stars on yelp  definitely 10 years of 3 star michelin rating deserved service was good of course  especially when i asked for madeleines on a course thing i didn t order  but was willing to pay extra for them  they just said they will bring them out  and they were baked fresh  and were the best madeleines ever  the dessert  banana parfait was not really my thing  of course delicious  but not as good as i expected  loved the surprises between and after courses    i ll leave that as a surprise alain ducasse  i felt more pampered but the main course was better here  it also came out to be more expensive since no wine  water  or tea included in teh menu so we were surprised to be charged all those things 
213	5.0	Like many others have commented, the meal my husband and I had here was without a doubt the BEST we have ever had.  Not only was the meal itself to die for, but the staff was exceptional and they oversaw our every culinary need.  My husband and I often suffer when it comes to service when we dine at finer establishments since we are on the younger side (i.e. mid-twenties); but, that was NOT the case here- the staff was so friendly and welcoming.  We can't wait to return for another meal.	like many others have commented  the meal my husband and i had here was without a doubt the best we have ever had   not only was the meal itself to die for  but the staff was exceptional and they oversaw our every culinary need   my husband and i often suffer when it comes to service when we dine at finer establishments since we are on the younger side  i e  mid twenties   but  that was not the case here  the staff was so friendly and welcoming   we can t wait to return for another meal

215	5.0	We went here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience. The service was truly amazing. The entire staff seems to look out for all the tables (rather than just having one server per table) and as a result you are constantly looked after but not interrupted. Because they do a staggered seating (no two tables are being seated at the same time), you are on a different cycle than the other guests dining which makes it feel like you're the most important guest when you arrive, order, and leave. The dining room is intimate and beautiful. I had the scallops to start, and it was my favorite course.  We also thought that for a 3 star Michelin, it was reasonably priced. We look forward to returning.	we went here on our honeymoon and had a wonderful experience  the service was truly amazing  the entire staff seems to look out for all the tables  rather than just having one server per table  and as a result you are constantly looked after but not interrupted  because they do a staggered seating  no two tables are being seated at the same time   you are on a different cycle than the other guests dining which makes it feel like you re the most important guest when you arrive  order  and leave  the dining room is intimate and beautiful  i had the scallops to start  and it was my favorite course   we also thought that for a 3 star michelin  it was reasonably priced  we look forward to returning 
216	5.0	My friend Mark is a Gordon Ramsay fanatic, and as he is a bachelor and his mortgage is only £320 a month (for a 2 bedroom house) he can afford to occasionally splash out on places like this. It was great.We were surrounded by a swarm of different waiters from the get-go, and it was a bit intimidating at first, since we'd booked for lunch (cheaper and available) and we were the first in. The maitre-d' took very good care of us. We were offered champagne, which we astutely declined, since it would have cost £12 a glass. My friend got the only menu with prices in, so we quickly skimmed to the back where the £45 lunch menu was. I chose the three Rs: Risotto, Rabbit and Rum-Baba. I selected an English white wine at £28 a bottle, but was told it was unavailable. That suited me, since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select, so we had that instead (£22 a bottle.) This was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices. The wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious. Difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better. An amuse bouche started, a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons, which annoyed me, so I didn't finish, which actually produced a comment from the m-d.The risotto was perfect. No other word for it. Every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right. It made us sorry to finish it. The rabbit was perfect as well, absolutely delicious. Rabbit pancakes were the first meal I ever ate in France, at Madame's in Le Touquet (5 course meals every night, real hot chocolate every morning) back in 1987, so it seemed appropriate. (Just realised the old girl is probably dead now.) I made my friends jealous with the rum baba, which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum. I was told I could ask for more rum (!) Because I had told the maitre-d' my friend had been to other Gordon Ramsays in Tokyo and New York (perfectly true, he likes spending his money) we were invited to have a look round the kitchens! Where we met the woman of his dreams, Clare Smyth, and had our photo taken with her. After that, while waiting for our coffees in the little front area, we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate. Lovely. The coffees were perfect. (so they should have been at a fiver each.)My only minor quibble was the decor, the panelling of the walls struck me as a bit strange- a bit like a hotel somehow. But it was a grand experience. i recommend it if you want to impress a potential mate or their parents.	my friend mark is a gordon ramsay fanatic  and as he is a bachelor and his mortgage is only  320 a month  for a 2 bedroom house  he can afford to occasionally splash out on places like this  it was great we were surrounded by a swarm of different waiters from the get go  and it was a bit intimidating at first  since we d booked for lunch  cheaper and available  and we were the first in  the maitre d  took very good care of us  we were offered champagne  which we astutely declined  since it would have cost  12 a glass  my friend got the only menu with prices in  so we quickly skimmed to the back where the  45 lunch menu was  i chose the three rs  risotto  rabbit and rum baba  i selected an english white wine at  28 a bottle  but was told it was unavailable  that suited me  since there was a cheaper wine we had been too snobby to select  so we had that instead   22 a bottle   this was cheaper than ordering by the glass and compares favourably to pub prices  the wine was stored in a chilled bucket and was absolutely delicious  difficult to see how a more expensive wine could have tasted better  an amuse bouche started  a little rosemary oil soup thing which we had to eat with little teaspoons  which annoyed me  so i didn t finish  which actually produced a comment from the m d the risotto was perfect  no other word for it  every little bit of seafood was cooked exactly right  it made us sorry to finish it  the rabbit was perfect as well  absolutely delicious  rabbit pancakes were the first meal i ever ate in france  at madame s in le touquet  5 course meals every night  real hot chocolate every morning  back in 1987  so it seemed appropriate   just realised the old girl is probably dead now   i made my friends jealous with the rum baba  which was big and light with a huge dish of cream and a jug of pure rum  i was told i could ask for more rum     because i had told the maitre d  my friend had been to other gordon ramsays in tokyo and new york  perfectly true  he likes spending his money  we were invited to have a look round the kitchens  where we met the woman of his dreams  clare smyth  and had our photo taken with her  after that  while waiting for our coffees in the little front area  we were given chocolate truffles and ice cream balls wrapped in white chocolate  lovely  the coffees were perfect   so they should have been at a fiver each  my only minor quibble was the decor  the panelling of the walls struck me as a bit strange  a bit like a hotel somehow  but it was a grand experience  i recommend it if you want to impress a potential mate or their parents 
217	5.0	For a 3 michelin star restaurant, I have very high expectations for Gordon Ramsay's flag ship restaurant.  This was quite possibly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in terms of the food.  I am usually not a big fan of foie gras but whatever they did to it, I loved it.  The gamey aftertaste was gone.  The highlight of the meal was the pork belly though, so tender and so flavorful.  I would fly back to London just to have that again.  Other highlights would be the fruit smoothie with pop rocks.  As with most of these types of restaurants, the service was exceptional.  They were very attentive and accommodating.  I highly recommend the 7 course tasting menu.  Yes, it's 120 pounds but when else are you going to go to Gordon Ramsay?	for a 3 michelin star restaurant  i have very high expectations for gordon ramsay s flag ship restaurant   this was quite possibly one of the best dining experiences i have ever had in terms of the food   i am usually not a big fan of foie gras but whatever they did to it  i loved it   the gamey aftertaste was gone   the highlight of the meal was the pork belly though  so tender and so flavorful   i would fly back to london just to have that again   other highlights would be the fruit smoothie with pop rocks   as with most of these types of restaurants  the service was exceptional   they were very attentive and accommodating   i highly recommend the 7 course tasting menu   yes  it s 120 pounds but when else are you going to go to gordon ramsay

219	4.0	Pics @ Chopstix2Steakniveschopstix2steaknives.blog… Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road. This is definitely one from the archives but which I still feel compelled to blog about. Most people either have a positive or negative impression of him. A lot of them commented on his swearing in Hell's Kitchen. I actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show.Lately, he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills.I came here a while back for the tasting menu.I especially liked the second canapés. Wafer thin and crispy, it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness.Pressed foie gras with Madeira jelly, smoked duck, peach and almond crumblePan fried sea scallops from the Isle of Skye with peas, crispy bacon, quail's eggs, baby gem lettuceRavioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney, vinaigretteFillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce, leeks and cep sauceCannon of Cornish lamb with confit shoulder, ratatouille and thyme jusRoasted pigeon from Bresse with grilled polenta, smoked pork belly and date sauceSelection of cheeses or pre dessertPineapple soup with toasted coconut and rumBitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant graniteI was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course. With all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around London, I think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered.I hope to see that from Gordon Ramsay.	pics   chopstix2steakniveschopstix2steaknives blog  gordon ramsay on royal hospital road  this is definitely one from the archives but which i still feel compelled to blog about  most people either have a positive or negative impression of him  a lot of them commented on his swearing in hell s kitchen  i actually like watching the show and a fiery kitchen is not uncommon and we do have to remember that it is played up for the show lately  he has been in the news more for his personal life than his culinary skills i came here a while back for the tasting menu i especially liked the second canap s  wafer thin and crispy  it was a flavour hit without the lingering greasiness pressed foie gras with madeira jelly  smoked duck  peach and almond crumblepan fried sea scallops from the isle of skye with peas  crispy bacon  quail s eggs  baby gem lettuceravioli of lobster  langoustine and salmon with tomato chutney  vinaigrettefillet of turbot with braised baby gem lettuce  leeks and cep saucecannon of cornish lamb with confit shoulder  ratatouille and thyme jusroasted pigeon from bresse with grilled polenta  smoked pork belly and date sauceselection of cheeses or pre dessertpineapple soup with toasted coconut and rumbitter chocolate and hazelnut cylinder with ginger mousse and blackcurrant granitei was impressed with the service and the food was good but unmemorable hence scarce descriptions accompanying each course  with all the new and exciting culinary places popping up around london  i think that chefs cannot afford to rest on their laurels and need to keep up with the ever increasing level and standard of food being offered i hope to see that from gordon ramsay

221	5.0	Despite what you may think about Gordon Ramsay the man, this restaurant remains #1 on my all time list.  Everywhere we go gets compared to Gordon (if going to a man's restaurant gives you permission to be on a first name basis).Of course everyone knows Gordon Ramsay. But it hadn't actually entered my mind to want to eat here until a friend went and just wouldn't stop going on and on about it.So when we got the chance to expense up to £200 on dinner it was the perfect opportunity.SERVICE......excellent.  As to be expected at a place like this, there were a lot of servers and other people to cater to your needs.  I liked how even with just 2 people they gave us a big table (same as a party of 4) to ourselves and seated us both on the same side facing the room (no one has to fight over who has to sit facing the wall).  I liked how when I got up and looked around they room they discreetly waved in the direction of the toilet.  I liked how when we ordered wine, and we're not that knowledgeable about wine, we just asked them to bring recommendations and they went off and did all the work figuring out what we ordered themselves without having to ask us.  I liked how they didn't bother us during to the meal to ask how it was, or if we were done, or if we needed anything.  I liked how they knew when to clear the plates - when we were both done (and yes, it helps greatly if you know proper table manners).  In short, they were knowledgeable, alert and very discreet.  The best service I've ever received and I probably rave about as much as I do the food.FOOD.... ah the food!  I could go on and on.  I won't even try to remember what hubby had but I ordered the foie gras and kobe steak.  However, what I remember most are the amuse bouche.  A spoonful of gelatin that was the essence of tomato.  And don't forget dessert.  Not sure if it's still on the menu but be sure to get the special dessert that's a sampler of the menu.  Tiny pots of chocolate, lavendar creme brulee, etc, etc.  We must have gotten at least 8 miniature desserts.  And especially don't forget the coffee.  It comes with 4 different kinds of chocolate including miniature ice cream cones (if you are too full at this point you can ask them to box up the chocolates to take home).  The reservation was for 6 and we were seated promptly.  We didn't leave until 10:30.  But at no time did we feel like food was coming out too slow.At the end of the evening we even got a tour of the kitchen and met the chef.Of course all of this comes at a PRICE... which was worth it.  The total meal came out to around £250ish with 2 prix fixe meals (extra for the kobe steak), 2 glasses of champagne, 2 glasses of white wine with starters, 1 bottle of red with meal and coffee/chocolates.  Service is included in the price so you don't need to worry about that.	despite what you may think about gordon ramsay the man  this restaurant remains  1 on my all time list   everywhere we go gets compared to gordon  if going to a man s restaurant gives you permission to be on a first name basis  of course everyone knows gordon ramsay  but it hadn t actually entered my mind to want to eat here until a friend went and just wouldn t stop going on and on about it so when we got the chance to expense up to  200 on dinner it was the perfect opportunity service      excellent   as to be expected at a place like this  there were a lot of servers and other people to cater to your needs   i liked how even with just 2 people they gave us a big table  same as a party of 4  to ourselves and seated us both on the same side facing the room  no one has to fight over who has to sit facing the wall    i liked how when i got up and looked around they room they discreetly waved in the direction of the toilet   i liked how when we ordered wine  and we re not that knowledgeable about wine  we just asked them to bring recommendations and they went off and did all the work figuring out what we ordered themselves without having to ask us   i liked how they didn t bother us during to the meal to ask how it was  or if we were done  or if we needed anything   i liked how they knew when to clear the plates   when we were both done  and yes  it helps greatly if you know proper table manners    in short  they were knowledgeable  alert and very discreet   the best service i ve ever received and i probably rave about as much as i do the food food     ah the food   i could go on and on   i won t even try to remember what hubby had but i ordered the foie gras and kobe steak   however  what i remember most are the amuse bouche   a spoonful of gelatin that was the essence of tomato   and don t forget dessert   not sure if it s still on the menu but be sure to get the special dessert that s a sampler of the menu   tiny pots of chocolate  lavendar creme brulee  etc  etc   we must have gotten at least 8 miniature desserts   and especially don t forget the coffee   it comes with 4 different kinds of chocolate including miniature ice cream cones  if you are too full at this point you can ask them to box up the chocolates to take home    the reservation was for 6 and we were seated promptly   we didn t leave until 10 30   but at no time did we feel like food was coming out too slow at the end of the evening we even got a tour of the kitchen and met the chef of course all of this comes at a price    which was worth it   the total meal came out to around  250ish with 2 prix fixe meals  extra for the kobe steak   2 glasses of champagne  2 glasses of white wine with starters  1 bottle of red with meal and coffee chocolates   service is included in the price so you don t need to worry about that 
222	5.0	Quite possibly the finest restaurant I have ever visited and one that all other like establishments will be compared to. The food was stunning, with a subtle depth of flavour to every dish. Service was attentive, and pleasant, and the atmosphere was relaxing. The staff were very accommodating, helpful and relaxed, happy to aid in every aspect of your dining experience. The only aspect with this restaurant that might cause an issue is its demand. If you wish to have dinner here then I recommend booking at least two months in advance, if you're having lunch then six weeks.	quite possibly the finest restaurant i have ever visited and one that all other like establishments will be compared to  the food was stunning  with a subtle depth of flavour to every dish  service was attentive  and pleasant  and the atmosphere was relaxing  the staff were very accommodating  helpful and relaxed  happy to aid in every aspect of your dining experience  the only aspect with this restaurant that might cause an issue is its demand  if you wish to have dinner here then i recommend booking at least two months in advance  if you re having lunch then six weeks

224	3.0	I am not really sure what to say about this place Shall I say about the food? the place? The price? or the celebrity-eccentric-business man? A bit of everything. The food: is a classic 2 michelin star restaurant anywhere else in the world. I really don't get why to be the only 3 star (which actually does not worth) in London, for such many years? (For me is obvious that connections work well..). Why French? You are in England, show us something F**g traditional English! You think you can challenge French 3-star? Don't think so.. The place: I know what minimal is but your place is bloody bad. A small room (that's fine) old decorated, probably modern when it was first launched.. The price: Overpriced, but someone needs to pay this guy's name! 3 people had 3 courses and glasses of wine for each course (not the dessert) and we payed £600+ ... The Celebrity under Gordon Ramsay's name: I was really disappointed overall. I expected something extraordinary from the only 3 star restaurant for so many years in London but that's not the case. I would like to see the chef, talk to people and be friendly like SO many great chef's who worth in throughout the world. He was probably busy opening another branch somewhere I guess.. Overall: Over rated, friendly staff, average food (for what it is comparing it to other 3 star restaurants). How can we compare this guy's restaurant with the amazing chef Arzak in San Sebastian in Spain?... And that is just an example!	i am not really sure what to say about this place shall i say about the food  the place  the price  or the celebrity eccentric business man  a bit of everything  the food  is a classic 2 michelin star restaurant anywhere else in the world  i really don t get why to be the only 3 star  which actually does not worth  in london  for such many years   for me is obvious that connections work well     why french  you are in england  show us something f  g traditional english  you think you can challenge french 3 star  don t think so   the place  i know what minimal is but your place is bloody bad  a small room  that s fine  old decorated  probably modern when it was first launched   the price  overpriced  but someone needs to pay this guy s name  3 people had 3 courses and glasses of wine for each course  not the dessert  and we payed  600      the celebrity under gordon ramsay s name  i was really disappointed overall  i expected something extraordinary from the only 3 star restaurant for so many years in london but that s not the case  i would like to see the chef  talk to people and be friendly like so many great chef s who worth in throughout the world  he was probably busy opening another branch somewhere i guess   overall  over rated  friendly staff  average food  for what it is comparing it to other 3 star restaurants   how can we compare this guy s restaurant with the amazing chef arzak in san sebastian in spain     and that is just an example 
225	5.0	A couple of years ago, I celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant Gordon Ramsay. The first experience was trying to get a booking: not easy. If you're not a celebrity, you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you'd like to go. You can only book 2 months (or 3, I forget) in advance, and it's so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am. We couldn't get the exact day we wanted, and had to settle for a 10:15pm slot! Nevertheless, it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around. The restaurant is just one room, and not more than ten tables or so. It's white, surprisingly (to me) bright, and not that fancy. The focus is on the food. The menu was full of incredible choices. I don't remember now what each course was, but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite. As with this type of food, portions aren't huge, but there were a few rounds of amouse-bouches (and amusing they were, especially the bacon-and-eggs one) between courses that actually made us full at the end. While very classy, the serving staff didn't make you feel stupid if you weren't an expert at which utensil to use next. The sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36-page (!) wine list. Some special, recently-obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box, but we declined. Can't say enough about the staff: attentive, upscale, but chatty and helpful. The price was, obviously, immense. You know what you're getting into when you come here. If you're trying to treat someone, they have two menus, one with prices and one without. If you can get in, and you've saved your pennies to splurge for (for most of us) a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Gordon Ramsay's delivered for us. Did my girlfriend enjoy the experience? Well, she's now my wife.	a couple of years ago  i celebrated 5 years with my girlfriend by taking her to restaurant gordon ramsay  the first experience was trying to get a booking  not easy  if you re not a celebrity  you have to watch your calendar and be flexible with when you d like to go  you can only book 2 months  or 3  i forget  in advance  and it s so popular that almost all the bookings for that future date go from the moment their phone line opens at 9am  we couldn t get the exact day we wanted  and had to settle for a 10 15pm slot  nevertheless  it was a pretty phenomenal experience all around  the restaurant is just one room  and not more than ten tables or so  it s white  surprisingly  to me  bright  and not that fancy  the focus is on the food  the menu was full of incredible choices  i don t remember now what each course was  but they were all tastes of such expert combination and expression that you groaned a bit with each bite  as with this type of food  portions aren t huge  but there were a few rounds of amouse bouches  and amusing they were  especially the bacon and eggs one  between courses that actually made us full at the end  while very classy  the serving staff didn t make you feel stupid if you weren t an expert at which utensil to use next  the sommelier was a great help at selecting from the 36 page     wine list  some special  recently obtained truffles were wafted past us in a wooden box  but we declined  can t say enough about the staff  attentive  upscale  but chatty and helpful  the price was  obviously  immense  you know what you re getting into when you come here  if you re trying to treat someone  they have two menus  one with prices and one without  if you can get in  and you ve saved your pennies to splurge for  for most of us  a once in a lifetime meal  gordon ramsay s delivered for us  did my girlfriend enjoy the experience  well  she s now my wife 
226	3.0	3 Michelin Stars (the food seems to be about equal from 2 stars to 3, only difference I can see is the ridic attention to detail (service wise))Slightly difficult to get into so book ahead of time.The foie gras dish here is so different and unique from any other variation I've had. It's serious. Most of the seafood courses were okay, but the sauces just made them so much better. I had pigeon for the first time. According to the waiter, they were the kind from the woods and not from Trafalgar Square. Also, just in case you were curious, pigeon meat is very tough and red. It was alright. The smoked pork belly that came on the side wow! Just wow! It's a bacon lovers dream!Okay now onto the cheese. Wow such a large selection of cheeses and the cranberry bread that came with them was amazing! Pre-desert (hah! love this, that the term pre-desert exists that is) was a creme brulee variation with a side of freshly pressed apple juice. It was like a non alcoholic wine pairing and it worked perfectly together. Next was a strawberry champagne smoothie and we finished off with a chocolate and hazelnut concoction. It had ginger mouse on top and was of course wonderful. Arriving with the check, was what looked like a pot of dry ice (it was underneath). It was white chocolate covered strawberry ice cream!

229	4.0	[Non-photo review] For full review, please see: wp.me/pwXBH-Ha  Restaurant Gordon Ramsay  The Royal Treatment Summary:Restaurant Gordon Ramsay  Royal Hospital Road provided us with a highly enjoyable and satisfying evening. The food was mostly classic in nature and nearly all of the numerous dishes we ordered were executed with a fine precision, with a few bits of fun thrown in for good measure. The service is simply extraordinary, and we were treated like regulars even though it was our first visit. The young Head Chef, Clare Smyth, is clearly talented, and it will be interesting to see how she develops over the coming years. It's easy to see why people like eating here: its formula is tried & tested, but it works. Driving to hospital So, first of all: a little apology. I've been busy recently: busy working, busy eating, busy drinking (wine mostly), but not busy writing blog posts about what I've been eating (or about the wine I've been drinking). In any case, my parents were in town a few months back, in the heart of what then seemed like London's everlasting darkness, and I wanted to plan a special meal while they were here. Given that, at the time, there was only one 3-starred Michelin restaurant in central London and that we hadn't made it there yet, I thought it was high time to pay Gordon Ramsay's flagship outfit a visit. (Since then, Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester has been elevated to 3 stars as well). While it has become easier to book lunch at Restaurant Gordon Rasmsay  Royal Hospital Road (RHR) in Chelsea, due to the fact that you can reserve a table directly on their website, it is far more difficult securing a dinner reservation, and thus I made mine approximately two months in advance. The difficulty likely stems from the fact that RHR is a very small venue, with only about 12-14 tables in total, and also due to the obvious factors of it holding 3 Michelin stars for years and being the pinnacle of Mr. Ramsay's little (well, shrinking) restaurant empire. A few other tidbits to note about the restaurant: it is one of the few remaining places requiring men to don jackets for dinner; it is only open Monday to Friday (so don't think on planning a special occasion on a Saturday or Sunday there); and, of course, Gordon is not usually there himself (though he does make appearances). Since 2007, the kitchen has been run by Head Chef Clare Smyth, a very pleasant young lady in her early 30's and one of the few women to run a 3-étoiles establishment. Entering Ramsay's world As readers of this blog will probably know, I have been to a lot of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, both in the UK and the US  when Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH) still ran them  and I have generally been impressed with the quality of the food and service levels. Sure, there have been the odd fumbles and occasional disappointments, and they are not generally given to the most creative and inventive style of modern high-end cooking (though a few try to do this; I'm looking at you Maze), but overall I haven't had all that much to complain about within GRH establishments. Poor old Gordon has gotten it quite bad from the British press over the last year, and he's certainly out to makeover his public image (having recently done the same for his face) and reinvent himself, both of which I suppose were inevitable given the nature of the British press and his own personality. I have to say that I do have a lot of respect and admiration for the man's drive, ambition and achievements. Whatever you want to say about his restaurants, their finances or his diction, he certainly created a lot out of very humble beginnings and has both directly and indirectly helped to regenerate and re-energize the movement towards better food in Britain over the last decade or so. But enough about the big man himself, as he wasn't in the kitchen during our meal. Mrs. LF and I drove my parents to the restaurant and were graciously greeted and shown through the little hallway to a small bar which serves as a holding area for the restaurant. The entrance is funny because there are slits in the wall to your left, behind which lies the dining room. Some of these slits are mirrored on the side and some are compeltely empty, so you're not actually sure if you're looking into the dining room or not (you are). Anyway, after a little kafuffle over the position of our table (my father is even more particular then moi when it comes to table choice)  which the staff handled effortlessly  we had arrived and were ready to get this show on the road, or on the table as it may be. Speaking of the table, I have to say it was a beautiful little arrangement. There were fresh flowers on each table (and in the bathrooms), as well stunning modern lanterns with blue flames and luxurious tablecloths and cutlery. It is really a tiny room, but it doesn't feel crowded and it isn't loud. And it is one of the few restaurants in London that doesn't have ANY background music, which is a	 non photo review  for full review  please see  wp me pwxbh ha  restaurant gordon ramsay  the royal

establishments  poor old gordon has gotten it quite bad from the british press over the last year  and he s certainly out to makeover his public image  having recently done the same for his face  and reinvent himself  both of which i suppose were inevitable given the nature of the british press and his own personality  i have to say that i do have a lot of respect and admiration for the man s drive  ambition and achievements  whatever you want to say about his restaurants  their finances or his diction  he certainly created a lot out of very humble beginnings and has both directly and indirectly helped to regenerate and re energize the movement towards better food in britain over the last decade or so  but enough about the big man himself  as he wasn t in the kitchen during our meal  mrs  lf and i drove my parents to the restaurant and were graciously greeted and shown through the little hallway to a small bar which serves as a holding area for the restaurant  the entrance is funny because there are slits in the wall to your left  behind which lies the dining room  some of these slits are mirrored on the side and some are compeltely empty  so you re not actually sure if you re looking into the dining room or not  you are   anyway  after a little kafuffle over the position of our table  my father is even more particular then moi when it comes to table choice   which the staff handled effortlessly  we had arrived and were ready to get this show on the road  or on the table as it may be  speaking of the table  i have to say it was a beautiful little arrangement  there were fresh flowers on each table  and in the bathrooms   as well stunning modern lanterns with blue flames and luxurious tablecloths and cutlery  it is really a tiny room  but it doesn t feel crowded and it isn t loud  and it is one of the few restaurants in london that doesn t have any background music  which is a

231	5.0	A couple of years ago, Restaurant Gordon Ramsey graced me with one of the most exquisite meals of my life. The signature Menu Prestige is a savory progression of flavors, textures, and explorations of gastronomical beauty. The sauteed foie gras was seared to a lovely mocha hue, while the lobster and langoustine ravioli was impossibly light, and gently infused with citrine ocean flavors. The cheese trolley held many local treasures, and the ginger mousse's piquant bite was diffused by its heady bitter chocolate cylinder. And I have never savored such a fruity, delicate pigeon dish. Highly recommended.	a couple of years ago  restaurant gordon ramsey graced me with one of the most exquisite meals of my life  the signature menu prestige is a savory progression of flavors  textures  and explorations of gastronomical beauty  the sauteed foie gras was seared to a lovely mocha hue  while the lobster and langoustine ravioli was impossibly light  and gently infused with citrine ocean flavors  the cheese trolley held many local treasures  and the ginger mousse s piquant bite was diffused by its heady bitter chocolate cylinder  and i have never savored such a fruity  delicate pigeon dish  highly recommended 
232	5.0	I'll start by saying, this is possibly the best meal of my life!  Service, food, ambiance was all wonderful.  I didn't have any wine, but my husband said his was good.  It was pricey (90 euro for 3 course lunch, 120 for the chef's menu) though, but worth every penny of it.  The best dish we had was the classic ravioli with lobster.  The texture and sauce was to die for.  Also, if you go and have 2+ people, they have the dessert where they give you a small sample of everything.  Everything here is aimed at perfection.  I'm a pretty tough judge and even I'm going to say they've hit the nail in the head for this one.  Now I'll need to really really think to see if I think Ritz SF, French Laundry or Restaurant Gordon Ramsay is my favorite place on earth!	i ll start by saying  this is possibly the best meal of my life   service  food  ambiance was all wonderful   i didn t have any wine  but my husband said his was good   it was pricey  90 euro for 3 course lunch  120 for the chef s menu  though  but worth every penny of it   the best dish we had was the classic ravioli with lobster   the texture and sauce was to die for   also  if you go and have 2  people  they have the dessert where they give you a small sample of everything   everything here is aimed at perfection   i m a pretty tough judge and even i m going to say they ve hit the nail in the head for this one   now i ll need to really really think to see if i think ritz sf  french laundry or restaurant gordon ramsay is my favorite place on earth 
233	4.0	Good, but certainly not as good as French Laundry or the Meadowood.  The whole experience was not treated as special an  experience.  The meal moved much faster than those restaurants.  Some of the food reminded me of FL, but it just wasn't quite as tasty.   For the price, and the price was on par with FL, I expect a little bit more of a production.	good  but certainly not as good as french laundry or the meadowood   the whole experience was not treated as special an  experience   the meal moved much faster than those restaurants   some of the food reminded me of fl  but it just wasn t quite as tasty    for the price  and the price was on par with fl  i expect a little bit more of a production 
234	5.0	"Ok, let's get the less than awesome things out of the way so I can start going on and on about how great this restaurant is. First off, if you do not live in the UK and do not have an international calling plan (I got one specifically to make my reservation here), it is a bitch to get a reservation. You have to physically call the restaurant - no emails, and call on London time, to get a table. You also have to call several months in advance (1 1/2 months in advance and I was lucky enough to get a table at 9:45 on a Wednesday). Second, when you finally do make your reservation you have to secure it with a credit card at (gulp) 150 pounds per person. Meaning, that if you don't show up, or cancel with 48 hours notice, you're billed 150 pounds for each guest. And lastly, this restaurant is very very expensive, but it was hands down the best meal of my life, so I'm gonna go ahead and say it was worth it. On to the good things! The design and ambiance of Gordon Ramsay is incredibly elegant (3 Michelin stars will do that to a place) - everything just blended together seamlessly. The service here was also impeccable, and not in a snotty ""I'm better than you"" way, rather in a gracious, helpful and attentive way. We were always checked on, engaged with and made to feel very at home. Now the food! I ordered the 3 course menu (there's also a lot of amuse bouches that occur throughout the meal) and everything was phenomenal.  My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, which was incredible, and I ordered the sweetbreads and foie gras (I usually oppose foie gras because I think it's mean, but I love it so I made an exception for GR and I'm very glad I did). Everything was wonderfully flavored and incredibly decadent and tender. I also had this with a Muscat (I believe) that tasted like passion fruit and was recommended to me by the Sommelier that paired up perfectly with the sweetbreads and foie gras. Next up, I ordered the highland venison loin which, when combined with the pumpkin and the chestnut puree tasted like the very essence of Fall, it was just wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the turbot with linguine and mushrooms, which was more turbot on a tiny bed on linguine and mushrooms, a little different from what I was expecting, but still very fresh, delicious and the wild mushrooms were the best tasting mushrooms I've ever had. Finally, for dessert we ordered the sampling of everything (duh.) which came out to about 8 pretty large ""mini"" desserts. They had to clear everything off of our table to fit it all on, but everything was amazing. If we weren't already beyond capacity, when the bill came they brought silver dusted truffles on a metal tree and frozen balls of strawberry ice cream covered in white chocolate over dry ice (nice touch, beautifully presented, but by this point I'm having to run to the bathroom to unzip my dress so I can breathe). All in all this comes to about 90 pounds per person (so why are you charging me 150 if I don't show up?) and yes, it is very expensive but I think well worth it. I will always remember this dinner and it was exactly what I wanted my first (hopefully not last) 3 star Michelin experience to be."	ok  let s get the less than awesome things out of the way so i can start going on and on about how great this restaurant is  first off  if you do not live in the uk and do not have an international calling plan  i got one specifically to make my reservation here   it is a bitch to get a reservation  you have to physically call the restaurant   no emails  and call on london time  to get a table  you also have to call several months in advance  1 1 2 months in advance and i was lucky enough to get a table at 9 45 on a wednesday   second  when you finally do make your reservation you have to secure it with a credit card at  gulp  150 pounds per person  meaning  that if you don t show up  or cancel with 48 hours notice  you re billed 150 pounds for each guest  and lastly  this restaurant is very very expensive  but it was hands down the best meal of my life  so i m gonna go ahead and say it was worth it  on to the good things  the design and ambiance of gordon ramsay is incredibly elegant  3 michelin stars will do that to a place    everything just blended together seamlessly  the service here was also impeccable  and not in a snotty  i m better than you  way  rather in a gracious  helpful and attentive way  we were always checked on  engaged with and made to feel very at home  now the food  i ordered the 3 course menu  there s also a lot of amuse bouches that occur throughout the meal  and everything was phenomenal   my boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli  which was incredible  and i ordered the sweetbreads and foie gras  i usually oppose foie gras because i think it s mean  but i love it so i made an exception for gr and i m very glad i did   everything was wonderfully flavored and incredibly decadent and tender  i also had this with a muscat  i believe  that tasted like passion fruit and was recommended to me by the sommelier that paired up perfectly with the sweetbreads and foie gras  next up  i ordered the highland venison loin which  when combined with the pumpkin and the chestnut puree tasted like the very essence of fall  it was just wonderful  my boyfriend ordered the turbot with linguine and mushrooms  which was more turbot on a tiny bed on linguine and mushrooms  a little different from what i was expecting  but still very fresh  delicious and the wild mushrooms were the best tasting mushrooms i ve ever had  finally  for dessert we ordered the sampling of everything  duh   which came out to about 8 pretty large  mini  desserts  they had to clear everything off of our table to fit it all on  but everything was amazing  if we weren t already beyond capacity  when the bill came they brought silver dusted truffles on a metal tree and frozen balls of strawberry ice cream covered in white chocolate over dry ice  nice touch  beautifully presented  but by this point i m having to run to the bathroom to unzip my dress so i can breathe   all in all this comes to about 90 pounds per person  so why are you charging me 150 if i don t show up   and yes  it is very expensive but i think well worth it  i will always remember this dinner and it was exactly what i wanted my first  hopefully not last  3 star michelin experience to be 
235	5.0	Of all the Ramsay restaurants this is still, I think, the best. The food is more innovative than the others and the service sublime. Its not cheap but then what do you expect from all those Stars. It is not, in my view, the best restaurant I have been to in the UK but it is certainly in my top five and I would heartly recommend it. The most memorable dish I have had there was the breakfast served in an eggshell. How can they get something so simple to taste so good !	of all the ramsay restaurants this is still  i think  the best  the food is more innovative than the others and the service sublime  its not cheap but then what do you expect from all those stars  it is not  in my view  the best restaurant i have been to in the uk but it is certainly in my top five and i would heartly recommend it  the most memorable dish i have had there was the breakfast served in an eggshell  how can they get something so simple to taste so good  
236	4.0	Absolutely superb but not very cheap at all! This was the very first time I ate at a restaurant with three Michelin stars. The service was discreet but not overbearing in my opinion. My wife on the other hand found the constant topping-up of our mineral water a little bit over the top though. The food was to die for. I do not eat much fish but the sea bass was mouth watering! The presentation of the food was even more incredible. I would definitely recommend Gordon Ramsay as a one off for a special occasion if you want to treat yourself.	absolutely superb but not very cheap at all  this was the very first time i ate at a restaurant with three michelin stars  the service was discreet but not overbearing in my opinion  my wife on the other hand found the constant topping up of our mineral water a little bit over the top though  the food was to die for  i do not eat much fish but the sea bass was mouth watering  the presentation of the food was even more incredible  i would definitely recommend gordon ramsay as a one off for a special occasion if you want to treat yourself

238	5.0	Incredible dining experience. Prepare to be wowed by the attentive service, innovative dishes, incredible flavors and overall fantastic dining experience. The ambiance is classy but not over the top, charming but not too sweet, modern but not perfectly symmetrical. I thought it strikes a balance between elegance and sophistication that really appealed to me. Onto the important bits:Wine recommendations are on point. Meat fruit plate is a gorgeous presentation of chicken liver; taste wise it was just fantastic. It's served with a thick piece of buttered & grilled toast. If you eat up your toast and still have pate left over, the attentive servers will already have started toasting up your next piece of bread to bring to you before you ask for it. The venison is presented beautifully and cooked to perfection, as was the ribeye. Both meats come with a small serving of sauces that are a perfect accompaniment to the meats. We finished up dinner with a tipsy toast -- a brioche bread that is cooked for an hour in a delicious concoction including brandy and a bunch of other delicious things. Absolutely delectable. I can't wait to return to this place on my next trip to London.	incredible dining experience  prepare to be wowed by the attentive service  innovative dishes  incredible flavors and overall fantastic dining experience  the ambiance is classy but not over the top  charming but not too sweet  modern but not perfectly symmetrical  i thought it strikes a balance between elegance and sophistication that really appealed to me  onto the important bits wine recommendations are on point  meat fruit plate is a gorgeous presentation of chicken liver  taste wise it was just fantastic  it s served with a thick piece of buttered   grilled toast  if you eat up your toast and still have pate left over  the attentive servers will already have started toasting up your next piece of bread to bring to you before you ask for it  the venison is presented beautifully and cooked to perfection  as was the ribeye  both meats come with a small serving of sauces that are a perfect accompaniment to the meats  we finished up dinner with a tipsy toast    a brioche bread that is cooked for an hour in a delicious concoction including brandy and a bunch of other delicious things  absolutely delectable  i can t wait to return to this place on my next trip to london 
239	1.0	I was super excited to try Dinner as I am a huge fan of Heston's larger than life, fun persona.I was very disappointed with the tasteless banal food placed in front of me as a vegetarian. There is a lot more to the world of vegetarian cuisine and Heston's Dinner was an apologetic nod at best. The three starters were very tasteless, with leeks seeming like the star veggie in every dish. The roasted cauliflower wasn't seasoned well. I have dined at some of the best restaurants in the world. Heston - hope you are listening !	i was super excited to try dinner as i am a huge fan of heston s larger than life  fun persona i was very disappointed with the tasteless banal food placed in front of me as a vegetarian  there is a lot more to the world of vegetarian cuisine and heston s dinner was an apologetic nod at best  the three starters were very tasteless  with leeks seeming like the star veggie in every dish  the roasted cauliflower wasn t seasoned well  i have dined at some of the best restaurants in the world  heston   hope you are listening  
240	5.0	Expect to be treated like royalty. Heston is a culinary genius and master of his craft. You'll change your view of foie gras when you take a bite of the meat fruit. From starters to dessert, it was a delight! Liquid nitrogen ice cream in London, I dare say, started here. Dined here in 2011 and liquid nitro ice cream was already on the menu. Then that trend all over London just boomed!	expect to be treated like royalty  heston is a culinary genius and master of his craft  you ll change your view of foie gras when you take a bite of the meat fruit  from starters to dessert  it was a delight  liquid nitrogen ice cream in london  i dare say  started here  dined here in 2011 and liquid nitro ice cream was already on the menu  then that trend all over london just boomed 
241	5.0	This restaurant comes near to a perfect restaurant experience. Service begins with somewhat hidden podium where the hostess greets confused guests as they try to figure out if going straight up the stairs is the right way. You are then escorted into a beautiful bar area and finally to a dining room that is spacious, beautifully designed and hosts a fancy but non-intrusive glass wall by the kitchen.I started this food journey with their famous whole-lotta-facebook-shared iconic meat fruit, which is this cute mandarin-looking chicken liver with crispy garlic bread. I can definitely eat 4 of these without much effort, and the presentation is naturally outstanding.My main - the pork chop, was simply good and perfectly cooked. Granted, it does not come with any amazing or surprising bells and whistles, but it serves its purpose and is quite filling.Lastly, after the experience that far, I had to sample some desserts. There were two that stood out, one for its meat fruit-like exquisite presentation (the chocolate egg), and another for its traditional British tribute (the tipsy cake). The egg was absolutely gorgeous, with every fine detail you would expect. I was not a huge fan of the citrusy yolk, but I also recognize that this is just a taste preference, rather than a quality issue. And then, there was the tipsy cake that, without a doubt, stole the prize in the latter portion of the meal. It was sweet, fluffy and flaky, not too eggy, delicious, not soggy at all. It was a perfect blend of all great bread pudding ideas, and implemented equally well.	this restaurant comes near to a perfect restaurant experience  service begins with somewhat hidden podium where the hostess greets confused guests as they try to figure out if going straight up the stairs is the right way  you are then escorted into a beautiful bar area and finally to a dining room that is spacious  beautifully designed and hosts a fancy but non intrusive glass wall by the kitchen i started this food journey with their famous whole lotta facebook shared iconic meat fruit  which is this cute mandarin looking chicken liver with crispy garlic bread  i can definitely eat 4 of these without much effort  and the presentation is naturally outstanding my main   the pork chop  was simply good and perfectly cooked  granted  it does not come with any amazing or surprising bells and whistles  but it serves its purpose and is quite filling lastly  after the experience that far  i had to sample some desserts  there were two that stood out  one for its meat fruit like exquisite presentation  the chocolate egg   and another for its traditional british tribute  the tipsy cake   the egg was absolutely gorgeous  with every fine detail you would expect  i was not a huge fan of the citrusy yolk  but i also recognize that this is just a taste preference  rather than a quality issue  and then  there was the tipsy cake that  without a doubt  stole the prize in the latter portion of the meal  it was sweet  fluffy and flaky  not too eggy  delicious  not soggy at all  it was a perfect blend of all great bread pudding ideas  and implemented equally well 
242	5.0	Ironically I decided to have lunch at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, mostly because I found it to be a much better value compared to dinner for essentially the same thing. They do a 3 course lunch tasting menu for about £50 that they are very flexible on. They will let you swap out or upgrade almost any item you want. The staff here is extremely profession, the epitome of fine dining, minus any bit of being pretentious. The menu is designed from historical recipes and it shows the year or time period the recipe was first created in. It's like time traveling through culinary history. The ambiance here is excellent, perfect for a romantic dinner or a business lunch with colleagues you are trying to impress. The cocktail program is pretty good but I was more impressed with the food. The wait staff was super professional without being pretentious. As for the food...Meat Fruit - This Foie Gras dish is one of their best known items and it is not only delicious but it is like a work of art. It is slightly sweet and very savory. I would recommend this to any fan of Foie.Iberico Pork - Perfectly cooked and plated. Very high quality meat. Not much else to say other than I really enjoyed it.Tipsy Cake - Another item they are famous for. They slow roast the pineapples for 5 hours, the cake is perfectly moist, and the vanilla sauce at the bottom is to die for. Not as visually stunning as their other items but it might be the best tasting.	ironically i decided to have lunch at dinner by heston blumenthal  mostly because i found it to be a much better value compared to dinner for essentially the same thing  they do a 3 course lunch tasting menu for about  50 that they are very flexible on  they will let you swap out or upgrade almost any item you want  the staff here is extremely profession  the epitome of fine dining  minus any bit of being pretentious  the menu is designed from historical recipes and it shows the year or time period the recipe was first created in  it s like time traveling through culinary history  the ambiance here is excellent  perfect for a romantic dinner or a business lunch with colleagues you are trying to impress  the cocktail program is pretty good but i was more impressed with the food  the wait staff was super professional without being pretentious  as for the food   meat fruit   this foie gras dish is one of their best known items and it is not only delicious but it is like a work of art  it is slightly sweet and very savory  i would recommend this to any fan of foie iberico pork   perfectly cooked and plated  very high quality meat  not much else to say other than i really enjoyed it tipsy cake   another item they are famous for  they slow roast the pineapples for 5 hours  the cake is perfectly moist  and the vanilla sauce at the bottom is to die for  not as visually stunning as their other items but it might be the best tasting 
243	5.0	My daughter recommended this used-to-be Michelin two star restaurant during our London stay. Meat Fruit looked beautiful and tasted nice and smooth, I can't believe it is from ancient receipts back to 13-15 centuries. Dressed Snails was not hard to chew. Roasted Quail was tender and tasty. Everything was perfect. Sometimes with little imagination, taste of history can really be realized, feeling like going through time tunnel, imagine how oneself is enjoying the same dish. it's unique experience. Food presentation was good and quality was excellent.	my daughter recommended this used to be michelin two star restaurant during our london stay  meat fruit looked beautiful and tasted nice and smooth  i can t believe it is from ancient receipts back to 13 15 centuries  dressed snails was not hard to chew  roasted quail was tender and tasty  everything was perfect  sometimes with little imagination  taste of history can really be realized  feeling like going through time tunnel  imagine how oneself is enjoying the same dish  it s unique experience  food presentation was good and quality was excellent

245	5.0	Stunning. Dinner by Heston delivers the total package: splendid environs, outstanding cuisine and attentive service. It is my favorite resto in London (thus far). Quite a unique concept whereby each dish is born out of a classic recipe (references provided!) dating from as far back as the Late Middle Ages. Don't fret - they are most assuredly updated for present day. The food was simply excellent all around. Wine list is voluminous and has some great finds, and excellent tea menu to conclude. Service was on point and extremely attentive. High recommend visiting if you are in the area; no question it deserves the two Michelin stars.Atmosphere- Expansive, airy dining room with beautiful design, as is found throughout the M.O. London.- Clearly upscale, but in a modern sense without being stifling. Not too formal.- Patrons wore a variety of attire, but generally 'smart casual'.- Decent spacing between tables.FoodLoved the concept of queuing off classic British recipes but updating them for the modern era. By the looks of it, without being told, this concept is not obvious. I like that - it means the food is not the least intimidating, but does have a cool lineage. This is almost beside the point, as the food was just plain delicious in and of itself. Execution was generally tight and precise. We enjoyed the:- Meat Fruit (Mandarin, Chicken Liver Parfait, Grilled Bread - £21.00): Mandarin orange gelee made the dish; stunning presentation; only nit the bread was a tad oily. Highly recommend.- Earl Grey Tea Cured Salmon (Lemon Salad, Gentleman's Relish, Exmoor Caviar - £19.50): Delicate and balanced flavors, the earl gray treatment rather unique.- Powdered Duck Breast (Braised & Grilled Red Cabbage, Spiced Umbles, Pickled Cherries - £44.00): Must order! Our favorite entree, such a lovely combination of flavors and perfect cook on the duck.- Roast Iberico Pork Chop (Pea's Pudding, Blood Pudding, Pickled Onion & Mint Oil - £44.50): Sadly, the pork was overcooked and a tad dry, but the flavors were still nice. Blood pudding in limited use, as a garnish mostly.- Buttered Purple Sprouting Broccoli (£5.50): A side, which was nice though mundane.- Tipsy Cake (Spit Roast Pineapple - £16.00): Favorite dessert! The sauce on top of the cake plus roasted pineapple are divine. Decadent in just the right way.- Brown Bread Ice Cream (Salted Butter Caramel, Pear & Malted Yeast Syrup - £15.00): Another solid dessert, though perhaps a tad less memorable than the former.BeverageWe began with a glass of the 2009 Moët & Chandon Grand Vintage Brut (£16), which was nice, and the Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum Gin, St Germain, Peach Syrup, Moët et Chandon 2009 - £21) which was alright, if overpriced.The wine list is expansive and contained an interesting array of options across price points. It would be nice if the list could be posted online for perusal in advance. With dinner, we truly loved the 2012 Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape 'La Crau' (£139), an excellent and decently priced option from the Rhône. To conclude, there is an excellent tea menu featuring Jing loose teas. Staff were happy to re-infuse the tea multiple times. We fancied the Silver Needle White Tea (£6.50).Service- Absolute professionals; warm and friendly - happily obliged our requests and answered questions.- When there was an issue with overcharging my credit card, the assistant manager promptly apologized and remedied the situation on the spot.- 13.5% service charge automatically included.	stunning  dinner by heston delivers the total package  splendid environs  outstanding cuisine and attentive service  it is my favorite resto in london  thus far   quite a unique concept whereby each dish is born out of a classic recipe  references provided   dating from as far back as the late middle ages  don t fret   they are most assuredly updated for present day  the food was simply excellent all around  wine list is voluminous and has some great finds  and excellent tea menu to conclude  service was on point and extremely attentive  high recommend visiting if you are in the area  no question it deserves the two michelin stars atmosphere  expansive  airy dining room with beautiful design  as is found throughout the m o  london   clearly upscale  but in a modern sense without being stifling  not too formal   patrons wore a variety of attire  but generally  smart casual    decent spacing between tables foodloved the concept of queuing off classic british recipes but updating them for the modern era  by the looks of it  without being told  this concept is not obvious  i like that   it means the food is not the least intimidating  but does have a cool lineage  this is almost beside the point  as the food was just plain delicious in and of itself  execution was generally tight and precise  we enjoyed the   meat fruit  mandarin  chicken liver parfait  grilled bread    21 00   mandarin orange gelee made the dish  stunning presentation  only nit the bread was a tad oily  highly recommend   earl grey tea cured salmon  lemon salad  gentleman s relish  exmoor caviar    19 50   delicate and balanced flavors  the earl gray treatment rather unique   powdered duck breast  braised   grilled red cabbage  spiced umbles  pickled cherries    44 00   must order  our favorite entree  such a lovely combination of flavors and perfect cook on the duck   roast iberico pork chop  pea s pudding  blood pudding  pickled onion   mint oil    44 50   sadly  the pork was overcooked and a tad dry  but the flavors were still nice  blood pudding in limited use  as a garnish mostly   buttered purple sprouting broccoli   5 50   a side  which was nice though mundane   tipsy cake  spit roast pineapple    16 00   favorite dessert  the sauce on top of the cake plus roasted pineapple are divine  decadent in just the right way   brown bread ice cream  salted butter caramel  pear   malted yeast syrup    15 00   another solid dessert  though perhaps a tad less memorable than the former beveragewe began with a glass of the 2009 mo t   chandon grand vintage brut   16   which was nice  and the chrysanthemum  chrysanthemum gin  st germain  peach syrup  mo t et chandon 2009    21  which was alright  if overpriced the wine list is expansive and contained an interesting array of options across price points  it would be nice if the list could be posted online for perusal in advance  with dinner  we truly loved the 2012 domaine du vieux telegraphe chateauneuf du pape  la crau    139   an excellent and decently priced option from the rh ne  to conclude  there is an excellent tea menu featuring jing loose teas  staff were happy to re infuse the tea multiple times  we fancied the silver needle white tea   6 50  service  absolute professionals  warm and friendly   happily obliged our requests and answered questions   when there was an issue with overcharging my credit card  the assistant manager promptly apologized and remedied the situation on the spot   13 5  service charge automatically included 
246	5.0	We were so excited to finally get to eat at a Heston Blumenthal restaurant! The dining room was so beautiful, the lighting fixtures on the wall were pudding tins! So much attention to detail in almost every little aspect of our experience. The service was excellent. I sneezed twice in the middle of eating (allergies) and by my second sneeze, a waiter had appeared at my side with tissues! All the food was excellent. The one negative was the Hereford filet my partner ordered. It was really dry and tough to cut and chew. Which was really surprising considering the quality and attention to detail in every other part of our meal. I would love to go back and try more items on the menu!	we were so excited to finally get to eat at a heston blumenthal restaurant  the dining room was so beautiful  the lighting fixtures on the wall were pudding tins  so much attention to detail in almost every little aspect of our experience  the service was excellent  i sneezed twice in the middle of eating  allergies  and by my second sneeze  a waiter had appeared at my side with tissues  all the food was excellent  the one negative was the hereford filet my partner ordered  it was really dry and tough to cut and chew  which was really surprising considering the quality and attention to detail in every other part of our meal  i would love to go back and try more items on the menu

The Bone in Rib of Hereford Prime for 2 (c.1830) was immense aswell as the Meat Fruit (chicken liver pate that looks like a clementine!) to start and the desserts.. well whatever you order you won't go wrong but the Tipsy Cake is amazing, but you need to order it at the start as it takes time to make	go here  and make sure you book in advance fantastic setting and it s lots of fun  whilst eating check out the ice cream trolly with home made ice cream being churned in a kitchen aid and liquid nitrogen puffing out as you dine go hungry and get all 3 courses   and wine  the bone in rib of hereford prime for 2  c 1830  was immense aswell as the meat fruit  chicken liver pate that looks like a clementine   to start and the desserts   well whatever you order you won t go wrong but the tipsy cake is amazing  but you need to order it at the start as it takes time to make
248	5.0	"At Dinner, Heston Blumenthal heavily draws his inspiration from historic British dishes. Next to each item on the menu, you can find the approximate decade that the dish originated from. The back page, meanwhile, lists exactly which cookbooks the recipes are based off of. There is even a separate sheet that details the origins of the first afternoon tea. Interesting stuff!The service and ambiance at Dinner are nothing short of stellar. The restaurant is, after all, located in the Mandarin Oriental. With its delicious food and gorgeous presentations, this 2-Michelin starred restaurant is easily one of my favorites in London. In fact, my dining experience here convinced me that I now have to visit The Fat Duck (but perhaps after several more paychecks). It also got me to check out the renowned chef's cookery program called ""Heston's Feasts"". You should have a look too; it's quite the series.// Meat Fruit (c.1500) (£18.50) - 5 starsThis appetizer is so aesthetically pleasing that you will not want to cut it open. It is a chicken liver and foie gras parfait enclosed in a thin layer of mandarin-infused jelly. The ingredients complement each other well, as the paste is neither too heavy nor too light. // Spiced Pigeon (c.1780) (£40.00) - 4 starsThe pigeon was perfectly seasoned with a crisp skin and juicy meat. I devoured this fowl to the bone since it was so succulent and tender. Everything about the dish was brilliant. I just wish the price tag weren't so steep.// Tipsy Cake (c.1810) (£14.50) - 5 starsNuggets of pillowy-soft brioche balls drenched in brandy cream, served with a slice of spit roasted pineapple.

249	3.0	Dinner has been recommended by a couple fellow foodies so I thought I'd treat a couple of my staff to celebrate a job well done for this London visit.Dinner is located inside the 5 star Mandarin Oriental and the service from the moment we stepped out of our ride until we left demonstrated why this hotel and the restaurant is worthy of the high praises and prices.To reach the dining room we walked through some narrow corridors and up a flight of stairs that sort of took us back to a bygone century.  The dining room itself is fairly modern.  The food served at Dinner is sort of a celebration of English food heritage mixed with some modern day creativity.The signature Meat Fruit was indeed worthy of it popularity.  The chicken liver parfait was encapsulated in a perfectly deceiving Mandarin orange peel made with marzipan.  The liver pate was smooth and full of flavor without any unpleasant bitterness.The Salamangundy was a dish dated back circa 1720 consisted of several of the precious chicken oysters (those 2 small oval shaped tenders at the top of the chicken thighs where they connect with the backbone), crunchy salsify and marrow atop a delicious horseradish cream was probably my favorite dish.The bone-in Hereford prime rib had that nice dry-aged flavor that is slightly smoky and livery.   The mushroom catchup went well with the trice fried chips.  I would have to say though that I'd expect a 2 star restaurant would have served a better marbled piece of beef.  The fat on this particular piece was not evenly distributed therefore it was not as tender I had expected even if they did sous vide it.While the signature dessert, Tipsy cake, was good it didn't blow me away.  The brioche was great; but the pineapple was not sweet.  I also thought the spit roasting was a bit of overkill.  The open flame grilled pineapple served at some churrascarias would have served the same purpose without the elaborate roaster and the length of time it took to prepare it here.  The open flame would have also helped better caramelize a coat of sugar on it, too.The salted butter caramel on the brown bread ice cream was also a little too salty that it overpowered the sweetness of the ice cream, the pear and the cake underneath.The prices at Dinner was fairly reasonable by London's standard.  Expect to fork over about 100 quids per person sans drinks. Overall, besides the Meat Fruit and Salamangundy, the rest of the meal while good didn't really blow me away.	dinner has been recommended by a couple fellow foodies so i thought i d treat a couple of my staff to celebrate a job well done for this london visit dinner is located inside the 5 star mandarin oriental and the service from the moment we stepped out of our ride until we left demonstrated why this hotel and the restaurant is worthy of the high praises and prices to reach the dining room we walked through some narrow corridors and up a flight of stairs that sort of took us back to a bygone century   the dining room itself is fairly modern   the food served at dinner is sort of a celebration of english food heritage mixed with some modern day creativity the signature meat fruit was indeed worthy of it popularity   the chicken liver parfait was encapsulated in a perfectly deceiving mandarin orange peel made with marzipan   the liver pate was smooth and full of flavor without any unpleasant bitterness the salamangundy was a dish dated back circa 1720 consisted of several of the precious chicken oysters  those 2 small oval shaped tenders at the top of the chicken thighs where they connect with the backbone   crunchy salsify and marrow atop a delicious horseradish cream was probably my favorite dish the bone in hereford prime rib had that nice dry aged flavor that is slightly smoky and livery    the mushroom catchup went well with the trice fried chips   i would have to say though that i d expect a 2 star restaurant would have served a better marbled piece of beef   the fat on this particular piece was not evenly distributed therefore it was not as tender i had expected even if they did sous vide it while the signature dessert  tipsy cake  was good it didn t blow me away   the brioche was great  but the pineapple was not sweet   i also thought the spit roasting was a bit of overkill   the open flame grilled pineapple served at some churrascarias would have served the same purpose without the elaborate roaster and the length of time it took to prepare it here   the open flame would have also helped better caramelize a coat of sugar on it  too the salted butter caramel on the brown bread ice cream was also a little too salty that it overpowered the sweetness of the ice cream  the pear and the cake underneath the prices at dinner was fairly reasonable by london s standard   expect to fork over about 100 quids per person sans drinks  overall  besides the meat fruit and salamangundy  the rest of the meal while good didn t really blow me away

251	5.0	Stellar fine dining experience that doesn't leave you feeling you're hungry or penniless after. The decor is modern and the space is quite large and cavernous. On a Thursday night, it was lively though not completely full and it wasn't too loud. Service is stellar with so many people working your table around the clock you start to lose track of who does what cause they all want to make sure you are enjoying your meal.Meat Fruit (4.5/5) - The signature dish doesn't disappoint. It's visually stunning and it tastes fantastic. I'm not sure if I'd repeat it again if I came back mostly cause the novelty wears off quickly but I applaud the artistic mastery at play here and the fact it doesn't sacrifice taste. It does taste relatively light compared to getting foie gras or bone marrow.Iberico Pork Chop (4/5) - Perfectly cooked so it's very tender and moist. The accompanying side had a weird texture (I think the splet wheat was covered in some sort of fat) that just felt a little unusual. Brussel Sprout Side (3/5) - Nothing extraordinary here. Just your usual veggies.Powdered Duck Breast (4/5) - Also expertly cooked. The long thick cut was nice and a welcome reprieve from the usual small medallion like cuts for Western style duck. I found it very moist though personally I prefer a crispier skin but as I'm not sure the cooking technique here used, may not be appropriate. Tipsy Cake (5/5) - hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had. It looks super simple but it has incredible flavors which is what ultimately counts. The spit roasted pineapple is delicious and tastes so decadent you can't believe it was a regular old pineapple a hour before (you have to pre-order when you sit down). The brioche buns are just heavenly.Overall, I thought this place didn't disappoint and the starter and dessert nailed it. I thought the pricing was very reasonable given the level of quality here, and because they let you order a la carte (rather than force you into some really long set menu) I came away feeling it was a relatively great value all things considered as long as you were ordering a normal amount of food (3 courses).-Victor	stellar fine dining experience that doesn t leave you feeling you re hungry or penniless after  the decor is modern and the space is quite large and cavernous  on a thursday night  it was lively though not completely full and it wasn t too loud  service is stellar with so many people working your table around the clock you start to lose track of who does what cause they all want to make sure you are enjoying your meal meat fruit  4 5 5    the signature dish doesn t disappoint  it s visually stunning and it tastes fantastic  i m not sure if i d repeat it again if i came back mostly cause the novelty wears off quickly but i applaud the artistic mastery at play here and the fact it doesn t sacrifice taste  it does taste relatively light compared to getting foie gras or bone marrow iberico pork chop  4 5    perfectly cooked so it s very tender and moist  the accompanying side had a weird texture  i think the splet wheat was covered in some sort of fat  that just felt a little unusual  brussel sprout side  3 5    nothing extraordinary here  just your usual veggies powdered duck breast  4 5    also expertly cooked  the long thick cut was nice and a welcome reprieve from the usual small medallion like cuts for western style duck  i found it very moist though personally i prefer a crispier skin but as i m not sure the cooking technique here used  may not be appropriate  tipsy cake  5 5    hands down one of the best desserts i ve ever had  it looks super simple but it has incredible flavors which is what ultimately counts  the spit roasted pineapple is delicious and tastes so decadent you can t believe it was a regular old pineapple a hour before  you have to pre order when you sit down   the brioche buns are just heavenly overall  i thought this place didn t disappoint and the starter and dessert nailed it  i thought the pricing was very reasonable given the level of quality here  and because they let you order a la carte  rather than force you into some really long set menu  i came away feeling it was a relatively great value all things considered as long as you were ordering a normal amount of food  3 courses   victor
252	5.0	Omg one of the best meals we've had! The meat fruit was definitely a must and was so good. The service here is on par. We both ordered fish for our entrees. Quantity and quality was 10/10. Both came with a delicious sauce. For dessert, we ordered the tipsy cake. My husband was a huge fan. You can also order ice cream which they will make at table side. There are pictures on yelp. Worth your time and money! Located in the Mandarin Hotel. Transit would be the way to go.FYI, on the back of each menu holder is a fun historical food tidbit!	omg one of the best meals we ve had  the meat fruit was definitely a must and was so good  the service here is on par  we both ordered fish for our entrees  quantity and quality was 10 10  both came with a delicious sauce  for dessert  we ordered the tipsy cake  my husband was a huge fan  you can also order ice cream which they will make at table side  there are pictures on yelp  worth your time and money  located in the mandarin hotel  transit would be the way to go fyi  on the back of each menu holder is a fun historical food tidbit

This starts from the person who greets you at the door, to every other person you'll interact with, even while walking to the restroom!. Everyone was incredibly polite and personable. Also, I would say this is one of the best meals I've ever had.  I've been to other Michelin star restaurants and wasn't that impressed   In fact, I usually trust Yelp much more than Michelin but this was my first 2 star Michelin restaurant and it didn't disappoint. The food was outstanding and the service was also perfect. Apparently Heston Blumenthal has 3 other restaurants in London, and one of the others is a 3 star Michelin restaurant (Fat Duck). I can only imagine what that tastes like. We'll definitely try and get a reservation there the next time we visit London. I can't recommend this restaurant enough, but be warned that you'll need to make reservations well in advance.	wow  wow  wow  the food here is just amazing and the service is also exceptional  this starts from the person who greets you at the door  to every other person you ll interact with  even while walking to the restroom   everyone was incredibly polite and personable  also  i would say this is one of the best meals i ve ever had   i ve been to other michelin star restaurants and wasn t that impressed   in fact  i usually trust yelp much more than michelin but this was my first 2 star michelin restaurant and it didn t disappoint  the food was outstanding and the service was also perfect  apparently heston blumenthal has 3 other restaurants in london  and one of the others is a 3 star michelin restaurant  fat duck   i can only imagine what that tastes like  we ll definitely try and get a reservation there the next time we visit london  i can t recommend this restaurant enough  but be warned that you ll need to make reservations well in advance

The food was excellent, the cocktails were great, and I was really happy when we were congratulated on our anniversary and also had a ""Happy 5th Anniversary"" written on the dessert plates.  Standout dishes were the meat fruit, the pork chop, and the tipsy cake. All very, very good.While the staff was nice, they did seem a bit sales-like when it came to ordering food.

256	3.0	So I came in forewarned by a lot of people that Dinner was a bit of an overhyped, possibly overrated dining experience - but as I didn't have a lot of time to change spots for Christmas Day dinner, I decided to stick with it, as I thought the concept was certainly worth enjoying. The entrance itself is to the left of the lobby once you walk inside the opulent Mandari Oriental's entrance, which is decked out quite nicely for Christmas (although it did remind me a bit of Melania Trump's somewhat eerie sensibilities when it came to Christmas decoration). For some reason, we were told to wait at the bar, and just as we were order our drinks, we were then shown in...to a dining room that was quite empty. I also wasn't a huge fan of how the seating was distributed; while there is a main dining area that has pretty similar views and decor for everyone, there is a small sliver near the exit from the kitchen that also houses seats. A minor nit at most, but it also meant that I felt I had a very lackadaisical view (since I was not facing the dining room). We also had a side view of the kitchen, which meant we had a less straightforward view of what was going on. Despite this, the servers were quite friendly and amiable, explaining each dish and giving us a bit more information on what was done (particularly the Tipsy cake). The wine selection by the glass was interesting; I went a bit bold and went with a Chinese red wine - I quite liked it, as it was big, full of tannins and a bit on the spicier side.The food selection is a la carte - no tasting menus, unlike most restaurants of this caliber - and the year of each menu item's original recipe (along with the title of the source) is included. It's quite novel, but on balance, I think the concept is more fun than how the food for a 2-star Michelin restaurant should turn out. I started with the sherried scallops, which I actually liked - very refreshing, with the sherry giving a nice acidic offset to the earthy (but light) mushroom broth. The scallops were pretty fresh as well, making the dish appropriate for winter but with less gravity than I would have expected. My wife's octopus was pretty decent as well - cooked quite well, although not really as remarkable flavors as I have had at other spots (it's hard to compare to Spanish preparation). We went with the bone-in ribeye to share, and this is where I think the chefs could have done better. The meat itself was delicious, and I really liked how it was cooked. I didn't care for the mushroom ketchup, and the triple-cooked fries that were served alongside were excellent. That said, there was so much fat on the ribeye that both of us had a decent amount of inedible meat stacked up on our plates once we were done. To be blunt, that kind of meat would be something I expect at a lower/mid-range restaurant that doesn't specialize in meats; here, it made me wonder how closely the cuts are actually inspected before being purchased. Dessert was excellent; I really did enjoy the Tipsy Cake and its light yet intensely sweet flavors. The spit-roasted pineapples are overrated, though; there was barely any caramelization or extra sweetness despite how prominently they are displayed in the kitchen (and the website).The food here? Certainly not bad and definitely above average. Is it worth the price? Certainly not, and that is what gives me pause about saying I would bother coming back. Like the concept, didn't love the ambiance, and the food was inconsistent at best. It's a curiosity that, if you really have the itch to burn money, you can visit - but given the diversity of options available in London, it should be further down on the list of choices.	so i came in forewarned by a lot of people that dinner was a bit of an overhyped  possibly overrated dining experience   but as i didn t have a lot of time to change spots for christmas day dinner  i decided to stick with it  as i thought the concept was certainly worth enjoying  the entrance itself is to the left of the lobby once you walk inside the opulent mandari oriental s entrance  which is decked out quite nicely for christmas  although it did remind me a bit of melania trump s somewhat eerie sensibilities when it came to christmas decoration   for some reason  we were told to wait at the bar  and just as we were order our drinks  we were then shown in   to a dining room that was quite empty  i also wasn t a huge fan of how the seating was distributed  while there is a main dining area that has pretty similar views and decor for everyone  there is a small sliver near the exit from the kitchen that also houses seats  a minor nit at most  but it also meant that i felt i had a very lackadaisical view  since i was not facing the dining room   we also had a side view of the kitchen  which meant we had a less straightforward view of what was going on  despite this  the servers were quite friendly and amiable  explaining each dish and giving us a bit more information on what was done  particularly the tipsy cake   the wine selection by the glass was interesting  i went a bit bold and went with a chinese red wine   i quite liked it  as it was big  full of tannins and a bit on the spicier side the food selection is a la carte   no tasting menus  unlike most restaurants of this caliber   and the year of each menu item s original recipe  along with the title of the source  is included  it s quite novel  but on balance  i think the concept is more fun than how the food for a 2 star michelin restaurant should turn out  i started with the sherried scallops  which i actually liked   very refreshing  with the sherry giving a nice acidic offset to the earthy  but light  mushroom broth  the scallops were pretty fresh as well  making the dish appropriate for winter but with less gravity than i would have expected  my wife s octopus was pretty decent as well   cooked quite well  although not really as remarkable flavors as i have had at other spots  it s hard to compare to spanish preparation   we went with the bone in ribeye to share  and this is where i think the chefs could have done better  the meat itself was delicious  and i really liked how it was cooked  i didn t care for the mushroom ketchup  and the triple cooked fries that were served alongside were excellent  that said  there was so much fat on the ribeye that both of us had a decent amount of inedible meat stacked up on our plates once we were done  to be blunt  that kind of meat would be something i expect at a lower mid range restaurant that doesn t specialize in meats  here  it made me wonder how closely the cuts are actually inspected before being purchased  dessert was excellent  i really did enjoy the tipsy cake and its light yet intensely sweet flavors  the spit roasted pineapples are overrated  though  there was barely any caramelization or extra sweetness despite how prominently they are displayed in the kitchen  and the website  the food here  certainly not bad and definitely above average  is it worth the price  certainly not  and that is what gives me pause about saying i would bother coming back  like the concept  didn t love the ambiance  and the food was inconsistent at best  it s a curiosity that  if you really have the itch to burn money  you can visit   but given the diversity of options available in london  it should be further down on the list of choices 
257	3.0	"Oh no. Really? 3? How we looked forward to this meal - getting a reservation here was one of the main reasons we chose to visit London for a very special weekend. Alas, disappointing main courses, iffy sommelier recommendations and not so special service really were a letdown.First, the meat fruit and the rice and flesh really are exquisite. Do get them both. They will blow you away.Main courses were a hard choice for us: with 3 versions of the same dish (the steak with mushroom gravy), we felt compelled to try it, but given the description of our server of the iberico pork chop (succulent, juicy, well-marbled) and duck breast (unique, pickled components, brightness), we felt we were making a solid decision on the mains. Unfortunately, both were overcooked (they were advertised as being served pink - the duck was brown through and through and the pork chop solid white) and neither really had anything particularly interesting to offer. The duck was fine, the pork chop was dry and totally devoid of any flavor. The description of gloriously piquant flavors for the one and deep smoky porkiness on the other were clearly goals rather than actual delivery.  They just didn't live up to our expectations at all.One final indignity on the mains: we ordered a side of the thrice cooked chips, and they were served in the same tiny cup as when you order the steak and they are meant to serve as a component. For 6.50, I expected that they would be a larger portion. There were a sum total of about 12 chips in there - they were very good, but not a reasonable portion for an additional side.The tipsy cake was indeed very good. Do order it. The cocktail menu was mind boggling but also extremely expensive - the priciest we've seen in London. They were, however, very good drinks. Sommelier recommendations on the wine did not live up to their descriptions - I wish we had gone with our own direction. We also had to ask repeatedly for service throughout the meal - we waited endlessly while the sommelier chatted up a nearby table, finally asked to see the wine list elsewhere, and apparently they only have one list to share in the entire section! Very odd.We were never checked on by our server, and actually had to flag her down to share our disappointment with the cooking on the main dish. Also, a minor point, but we asked for tap water and after our first few glasses, we were asked if we wanted to open ""another bottle"". We said that we had asked for tap, which was fine with us. When we reviewed the bill, they had charged us for a bottle of water despite our initial request (and despite the fact that the ""bottled"" water was served from the same jug as the tap we later received).Finally, I get the theme of the old cookery, but that doesn't mean that the menu should stay stagnant from here to eternity. I think it needs a little sprucing up...perhaps Heston needs to make a return visit from Oz to retool the menu, as it seems like recent reviews have been less favorable.Oh well. If you want a special meal in London, go to the Ledbury or the Clove Club. If you do wish to come here, order 2 first courses each and the dessert. Skip the mains. You'll be happy you did. And lower your expectations about service - whomever is running the front of the house clearly has other ideas."	oh no  really  3  how we looked forward to this meal   getting a reservation here was one of the main reasons we chose to visit london for a very special weekend  alas  disappointing main courses  iffy sommelier recommendations and not so special service really were a letdown first  the meat fruit and the rice and flesh really are exquisite  do get them both  they will blow you away main courses were a hard choice for us  with 3 versions of the same dish  the steak with mushroom gravy   we felt compelled to try it  but given the description of our server of the iberico pork chop  succulent  juicy  well marbled  and duck breast  unique  pickled components  brightness   we felt we were making a solid decision on the mains  unfortunately  both were overcooked  they were advertised as being served pink   the duck was brown through and through and the pork chop solid white  and neither really had anything particularly interesting to offer  the duck was fine  the pork chop was dry and totally devoid of any flavor  the description of gloriously piquant flavors for the one and deep smoky porkiness on the other were clearly goals rather than actual delivery   they just didn t live up to our expectations at all one final indignity on the mains  we ordered a side of the thrice cooked chips  and they were served in the same tiny cup as when you order the steak and they are meant to serve as a component  for 6 50  i expected that they would be a larger portion  there were a sum total of about 12 chips in there   they were very good  but not a reasonable portion for an additional side the tipsy cake was indeed very good  do order it  the cocktail menu was mind boggling but also extremely expensive   the priciest we ve seen in london  they were  however  very good drinks  sommelier recommendations on the wine did not live up to their descriptions   i wish we had gone with our own direction  we also had to ask repeatedly for service throughout the meal   we waited endlessly while the sommelier chatted up a nearby table  finally asked to see the wine list elsewhere  and apparently they only have one list to share in the entire section  very odd we were never checked on by our server  and actually had to flag her down to share our disappointment with the cooking on the main dish  also  a minor point  but we asked for tap water and after our first few glasses  we were asked if we wanted to open  another bottle   we said that we had asked for tap  which was fine with us  when we reviewed the bill  they had charged us for a bottle of water despite our initial request  and despite the fact that the  bottled  water was served from the same jug as the tap we later received  finally  i get the theme of the old cookery  but that doesn t mean that the menu should stay stagnant from here to eternity  i think it needs a little sprucing up   perhaps heston needs to make a return visit from oz to retool the menu  as it seems like recent reviews have been less favorable oh well  if you want a special meal in london  go to the ledbury or the clove club  if you do wish to come here  order 2 first courses each and the dessert  skip the mains  you ll be happy you did  and lower your expectations about service   whomever is running the front of the house clearly has other ideas

Its the perfect setting for a 2 star Michelin restaurant and the ambiance is classy without beeing overbearing.  The service staff (and yes there are many) makes you feel right at home.   I hade the very famous ""Meat fruit"" as a starter wich for the few that doesnt know is a chicken liver parfait dressed up to look like a mandarine. Served with a bit of toasted bread it was amazing with a creamy and smooth texture like no other parfait i have had before.  The great balancing act with the fatty parfait against the acidity of the ""mandarine shell"" was perfectly excecuted. The filé of Aberdeen Angus with mushroom ketchup and triple fried chips (yes fries for the americans) was cooked to perfection that for me is medium rare. The beef was so tender i could almost slice it with the fork and the flavor was so rich it ended way too fast. The condiments was simple but refined with the subtle mushroom flavor in the in house ketchup along with fries perfected by many many previous failures in the test kitchen.  Of course i had to go for the famous ""Tipsy Cake"" wich is a warm gooey piece of brioche soaked in liquore and cognac if i remember correct. Served with spit roasted pineapple this was the perfect ending on a great dinner experience even if im not a big dessert person.  Tasted my wifes ""Flesh & Rice"" , ""Powdered Duck Breast"" and ""Brown bread ice Cream"" and ther where all very very tasty.  Our bill without tip with a bottle of red came to 230 £ wich i find quite cheap for two Three course dinners with wine of this quality on a two star restaurant owned by one of the Worlds most famous chefs. The food is no joke either was so would recommend anyone who calls themselfs a foodie to eat at this food mecka."	we went here for our wedding anniversary and where not dissapointed   the restaurant is located inside the gorgeous and luxurious mandarin oriental hotel hyde park  its the perfect setting for a 2 star michelin restaurant and the ambiance is classy without beeing overbearing   the service staff  and yes there are many  makes you feel right at home    i hade the very famous  meat fruit  as a starter wich for the few that doesnt know is a chicken liver parfait dressed up to look like a mandarine  served with a bit of toasted bread it was amazing with a creamy and smooth texture like no other parfait i have had before   the great balancing act with the fatty parfait against the acidity of the  mandarine shell  was perfectly excecuted  the fil  of aberdeen angus with mushroom ketchup and triple fried chips  yes fries for the americans  was cooked to perfection that for me is medium rare  the beef was so tender i could almost slice it with the fork and the flavor was so rich it ended way too fast  the condiments was simple but refined with the subtle mushroom flavor in the in house ketchup along with fries perfected by many many previous failures in the test kitchen   of course i had to go for the famous  tipsy cake  wich is a warm gooey piece of brioche soaked in liquore and cognac if i remember correct  served with spit roasted pineapple this was the perfect ending on a great dinner experience even if im not a big dessert person   tasted my wifes  flesh   rice     powdered duck breast  and  brown bread ice cream  and ther where all very very tasty   our bill without tip with a bottle of red came to 230   wich i find quite cheap for two three course dinners with wine of this quality on a two star restaurant owned by one of the worlds most famous chefs  the food is no joke either was so would recommend anyone who calls themselfs a foodie to eat at this food mecka 
260	4.0	Dry ice ice cream!We had a wonderful dinner and enjoyed the reinvention of old British classic meals. I included the photos of all the dishes. The exciting part of the night was the dry ice ice cream machine that created a lot of smoke plumes and a show. It was excellent service and really stood out.	dry ice ice cream we had a wonderful dinner and enjoyed the reinvention of old british classic meals  i included the photos of all the dishes  the exciting part of the night was the dry ice ice cream machine that created a lot of smoke plumes and a show  it was excellent service and really stood out 
261	2.0	Unfortunately a very disappointing dining experience. Despite being listed as a 2* Michelin restaurant and among the best in the world, the service was dire and the chefs lacked creativity.We dined in the private room and selected the 4 course menu. The food did not live up to our expectations:1) Rice & Flesh: undercooked rice2) Salmon or Meat Fruit: the salmon was ok but out of season. I couldn't fault the meat fruit but I could have purchased this at my local Waitrose..3) Steak: lacked seasoning. 4) Chocolate bar: chocolate and passionfruit do not work well together. A member of our party has a number of allergies and the chefs were informed of these at least a month in advance. We were very disappointed to learn that the 1st and 2nd course consisted of a plate of salad leaves! Not the level of creativity you'd expect in a Michelin star establishment. Aside from the disastrous food, we had to wait over an hour for our first course, and endured a lengthy wait between the other courses! Perhaps the idea was to get us drunk enough that we wouldn't remember our unfortunate dining experience!	unfortunately a very disappointing dining experience  despite being listed as a 2  michelin restaurant and among the best in the world  the service was dire and the chefs lacked creativity we dined in the private room and selected the 4 course menu  the food did not live up to our expectations 1  rice   flesh  undercooked rice2  salmon or meat fruit  the salmon was ok but out of season  i couldn t fault the meat fruit but i could have purchased this at my local waitrose  3  steak  lacked seasoning  4  chocolate bar  chocolate and passionfruit do not work well together  a member of our party has a number of allergies and the chefs were informed of these at least a month in advance  we were very disappointed to learn that the 1st and 2nd course consisted of a plate of salad leaves  not the level of creativity you d expect in a michelin star establishment  aside from the disastrous food  we had to wait over an hour for our first course  and endured a lengthy wait between the other courses  perhaps the idea was to get us drunk enough that we wouldn t remember our unfortunate dining experience 
262	5.0	Dinner by Heston Blumenthal was an unforgettable meal while visiting London. This Michelin starred restaurant is located inside the beautiful Mandarin Oriental hotel. With British recipes hailing from the 13th-18th centuries, the menu itself is a marvel to read as it lets you know which year and cookbook the dish is inspired from.We started with the much buzzed about meat fruit which is chicken liver wrapped in a mandarin gelée and served with grilled bread. I didn't think it could be as good as everyone was making it out to be but with one bite, I was in awe. This is definitely a must order as long as you enjoy foie gras. We also got the roast marrowbone which had snails, parsley, anchovy, mace and pickled vegetables. It was pretty good but the meat fruit definitely stole the show. For our mains, we ordered the powdered duck breast and Hereford ribeye with mushroom ketchup and triple cooked chips. The duck was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth unlike any other duck I've ever tried. The ribeye was also phenomenal. While it felt funny to be eating chips in such a fancy restaurant, these were the best cooked chips (french fries for Yankees) I've ever had. Seriously. At the beginning of the meal, our waiter suggested to preorder the tipsy cake for dessert and I'm so happy he did. It's like a boozy bread pudding with pineapple. Definitely a must order. We drank one of the finest red wines I've ever had during the meal, and finished with a Sauternes with our dessert. It was amazing how attentive the service was without being intrusive from beginning to end.As mentioned, the restaurant itself is beautiful. We were seated near one of the windows that lets you peer into the kitchen to see all the busy chefs at work. It was awesome!Definitely make your reservation at least a week before heading to London as it fills up fast. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate recommending Dinner by Heston Blumenthal to anyone looking for a nice meal out in London. I know I'll be dreaming of going back!	dinner by heston blumenthal was an unforgettable meal while visiting london  this michelin starred restaurant is located inside the beautiful mandarin oriental hotel  with british recipes hailing from the 13th 18th centuries  the menu itself is a marvel to read as it lets you know which year and cookbook the dish is inspired from we started with the much buzzed about meat fruit which is chicken liver wrapped in a mandarin gel e and served with grilled bread  i didn t think it could be as good as everyone was making it out to be but with one bite  i was in awe  this is definitely a must order as long as you enjoy foie gras  we also got the roast marrowbone which had snails  parsley  anchovy  mace and pickled vegetables  it was pretty good but the meat fruit definitely stole the show  for our mains  we ordered the powdered duck breast and hereford ribeye with mushroom ketchup and triple cooked chips  the duck was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth unlike any other duck i ve ever tried  the ribeye was also phenomenal  while it felt funny to be eating chips in such a fancy restaurant  these were the best cooked chips  french fries for yankees  i ve ever had  seriously  at the beginning of the meal  our waiter suggested to preorder the tipsy cake for dessert and i m so happy he did  it s like a boozy bread pudding with pineapple  definitely a must order  we drank one of the finest red wines i ve ever had during the meal  and finished with a sauternes with our dessert  it was amazing how attentive the service was without being intrusive from beginning to end as mentioned  the restaurant itself is beautiful  we were seated near one of the windows that lets you peer into the kitchen to see all the busy chefs at work  it was awesome definitely make your reservation at least a week before heading to london as it fills up fast  all in all  i wouldn t hesitate recommending dinner by heston blumenthal to anyone looking for a nice meal out in london  i know i ll be dreaming of going back 
263	3.0	I fear that this restaurant has seen better days (at least that's what I hope, as I found this place to be a bit meh and couldn't figure out why it is so highly rated).  Perhaps it is resting on its laurels?So the food is fine - it was well presented and interesting.  I think the focus on historical British antecedents is an interesting idea.  And while all of the food we had was very good, none was transcendent (which is perhaps not what they are going for).  The service was similar - very good with an appropriate level of focus and a nice semi-familiar approach.  We got as much discussion and explanation as we desired and the staff was knowledgeable.So why the undertone of dissatisfaction?  I felt about this place a bit like I feel after eating at a big name Chef's place in Las Vegas.  It looks nice, and has all the food stuff you'd expect, but seems somehow a bit dumbed down. For example, Nobu in Vegas is a pale comparison to the real Nobu.  I felt like that about Dinner by HB.  I think maybe Dinner by HB has jumped the shark and is now overrun by the touristy crowd and the popular kids.  I found the whole experience of being in the room loud, obnoxious, and kind of disappointing.  Plenty of top restaurants are fun (check out The Clove Club) without losing their soul.  I can't say the same for this place.So my dilemma with a review like this is do I grade on a curve or not?  If so, in comparison to its Michelin starred peer group this place is a 3.  But if I graded on an absolute scale it would get a 4.  I'll go with 3 for my official rating, and definitely suggest you think about what you want for your fine dining dollars and whether you will get that here.	i fear that this restaurant has seen better days  at least that s what i hope  as i found this place to be a bit meh and couldn t figure out why it is so highly rated    perhaps it is resting on its laurels so the food is fine   it was well presented and interesting   i think the focus on historical british antecedents is an interesting idea   and while all of the food we had was very good  none was transcendent  which is perhaps not what they are going for    the service was similar   very good with an appropriate level of focus and a nice semi familiar approach   we got as much discussion and explanation as we desired and the staff was knowledgeable so why the undertone of dissatisfaction   i felt about this place a bit like i feel after eating at a big name chef s place in las vegas   it looks nice  and has all the food stuff you d expect  but seems somehow a bit dumbed down  for example  nobu in vegas is a pale comparison to the real nobu   i felt like that about dinner by hb   i think maybe dinner by hb has jumped the shark and is now overrun by the touristy crowd and the popular kids   i found the whole experience of being in the room loud  obnoxious  and kind of disappointing   plenty of top restaurants are fun  check out the clove club  without losing their soul   i can t say the same for this place so my dilemma with a review like this is do i grade on a curve or not   if so  in comparison to its michelin starred peer group this place is a 3   but if i graded on an absolute scale it would get a 4   i ll go with 3 for my official rating  and definitely suggest you think about what you want for your fine dining dollars and whether you will get that here 
264	5.0	Best meal in London by a mile. We are still talking about this phenomenal meal we had during our holiday trip.  This is located in the Mandarin Oriental hotel.  The staff was very professional, but warm, very welcoming.  We were made to feel that they were very happy to see us.  Sets the tone for an amazing meal.  We had the fruit for appetizer, hubby had the scallops.  It is awesome to realize the concept of the menu, based upon age old British recipes. You cannot go wrong with any of the superb offerings.  And for dessert---oh, the tipsy cake!  This has to be ordered in advance as it takes an hour to freshly bake.  We had a table beside the kitchen, and it was very nice to see all the activity in the kitchen.  We had a great meal.  Thank you for a great experience!	best meal in london by a mile  we are still talking about this phenomenal meal we had during our holiday trip   this is located in the mandarin oriental hotel   the staff was very professional  but warm  very welcoming   we were made to feel that they were very happy to see us   sets the tone for an amazing meal   we had the fruit for appetizer  hubby had the scallops   it is awesome to realize the concept of the menu  based upon age old british recipes  you cannot go wrong with any of the superb offerings   and for dessert   oh  the tipsy cake   this has to be ordered in advance as it takes an hour to freshly bake   we had a table beside the kitchen  and it was very nice to see all the activity in the kitchen   we had a great meal   thank you for a great experience 
265	5.0	This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my entire life. The dining experience is just one of a kind. The balance that this restaurant strikes between excellent service and a comfortable eating environment is superb. What I mean is that this is a Michelin star restaurant with stellar food, but you don't feel that the atmosphere is so prim and proper that you can't actually enjoy the food the way YOU want to.We were never waiting for anything or anyone; the service was so spot on that they were attentive enough to notice/anticipate our needs, but they didn't suffocate us and hover in the corner of our eyes either. What to get:The meat fruit (liver shaped as a tangerine)Order the tipsy cake at the beginning of dinner! I don't even have a sweet tooth, but this dessert is to die for.Vanilla ice cream because they make it table-side with liquid nitrogen and it tastes perfectly tart as an ending to your meal	this is one of the best restaurants i ve ever been to in my entire life  the dining experience is just one of a kind  the balance that this restaurant strikes between excellent service and a comfortable eating environment is superb  what i mean is that this is a michelin star restaurant with stellar food  but you don t feel that the atmosphere is so prim and proper that you can t actually enjoy the food the way you want to we were never waiting for anything or anyone  the service was so spot on that they were attentive enough to notice anticipate our needs  but they didn t suffocate us and hover in the corner of our eyes either  what to get the meat fruit  liver shaped as a tangerine order the tipsy cake at the beginning of dinner  i don t even have a sweet tooth  but this dessert is to die for vanilla ice cream because they make it table side with liquid nitrogen and it tastes perfectly tart as an ending to your meal

267	5.0	One of the most interesting fine dining experience I've had. I came here with a buddy of mine and started off the night with some fancy cocktails at the bar. We got:-Meat Fruit (5/5): Yea yea, you can get chicken liver pate wherever you go, but hey, it will never look like a clementine. Cutting into the facade, the meat fruit has an incredibly silky soft texture. The artisanal bread it came with is warm and chewy. A special experience!-Duck (5/5): grilled with skin and the moisture of the meat is nicely preserved. Nothing to complaint.-Goats milk cheese cake (5/5)-Ice Cream (5/5): They offer to make nitrogen infused ice cream right in front of you. A super cool experience. The toppings include popping candy---a reminiscent of childhood---on top of the freshly made ice cream.Service is impeccable. Romantic ambience. A perfect treat if you ever found yourself in London.	one of the most interesting fine dining experience i ve had  i came here with a buddy of mine and started off the night with some fancy cocktails at the bar  we got  meat fruit  5 5   yea yea  you can get chicken liver pate wherever you go  but hey  it will never look like a clementine  cutting into the facade  the meat fruit has an incredibly silky soft texture  the artisanal bread it came with is warm and chewy  a special experience  duck  5 5   grilled with skin and the moisture of the meat is nicely preserved  nothing to complaint  goats milk cheese cake  5 5  ice cream  5 5   they offer to make nitrogen infused ice cream right in front of you  a super cool experience  the toppings include popping candy   a reminiscent of childhood   on top of the freshly made ice cream service is impeccable  romantic ambience  a perfect treat if you ever found yourself in london 
268	5.0	Simply one of the best meals of my life!  My friends and I made reservations here as we wanted to hit a Michelin-starred restaurant during our vacation.  Dinner is located within the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a five-star hotel, and it reflects its surrounding.  Definitely a fine dining location.  Started with the Meat Fruit, a liver pate made to look like a mandarin orange, which was incredibly savory and full of flavor.  Normally I do not like liver, but this pate, especially when spread on the grilled bread, was phenomenal.  I followed this with the Lobster and Cucumber Soup.  Positively light and refreshing and a good contrast to the richness of the Meat Fruit.  For my main course I had the Roast Iberico Pork Chop.  Delicious and cooked to perfection.  The first dessert was the Spring Tart.  It was quite good, but the better dessert was clearly the Tipsy Cake, truly a stand out piece.  It explodes with flavor when you put the grilled pineapple with a piece of the cake itself.  Incredible.  The meal ended with the Nitrogen Ice Cream.  It was a lovely spectacle to watch as the waiter instantly made ice cream and topped it off with delicious toppings.  The service was very impressive.  The attentive waiters were incredibly knowledgeable about the food and gave fantastic recommendations to us all.  The staff truly know their craft.  Truly a must go.	simply one of the best meals of my life   my friends and i made reservations here as we wanted to hit a michelin starred restaurant during our vacation   dinner is located within the mandarin oriental hotel  a five star hotel  and it reflects its surrounding   definitely a fine dining location   started with the meat fruit  a liver pate made to look like a mandarin orange  which was incredibly savory and full of flavor   normally i do not like liver  but this pate  especially when spread on the grilled bread  was phenomenal   i followed this with the lobster and cucumber soup   positively light and refreshing and a good contrast to the richness of the meat fruit   for my main course i had the roast iberico pork chop   delicious and cooked to perfection   the first dessert was the spring tart   it was quite good  but the better dessert was clearly the tipsy cake  truly a stand out piece   it explodes with flavor when you put the grilled pineapple with a piece of the cake itself   incredible   the meal ended with the nitrogen ice cream   it was a lovely spectacle to watch as the waiter instantly made ice cream and topped it off with delicious toppings   the service was very impressive   the attentive waiters were incredibly knowledgeable about the food and gave fantastic recommendations to us all   the staff truly know their craft   truly a must go 
269	4.0	This is an overdue review! I had quite a decent amount of recommendations upon visiting the UK and Dinner was absurdly regarded in the highest honor among London visitors, so I decided to take a peek and see what will stimulate my gustatory senses and satiate my ravenousness hunger. We had a variety of meats with some more distinguishable than others (I'm looking at you meat fruit) yet were reasonably satisfying and finished off with brown bread ice cream which was creamy, simple, and palatable. Nothing to write home about, but do stop by if you are bored and want to experience luxury dining during your stay.	this is an overdue review  i had quite a decent amount of recommendations upon visiting the uk and dinner was absurdly regarded in the highest honor among london visitors  so i decided to take a peek and see what will stimulate my gustatory senses and satiate my ravenousness hunger  we had a variety of meats with some more distinguishable than others  i m looking at you meat fruit  yet were reasonably satisfying and finished off with brown bread ice cream which was creamy  simple  and palatable  nothing to write home about  but do stop by if you are bored and want to experience luxury dining during your stay 
270	5.0	"Set inside the Edwardian-styled Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal immerses you into the sleek and sophisticated world of power dining. This is not an intimate two Michelin star affair, where you can luxuriate in a romantic candlelit dinner. This is a stylish corporate affair in a high-ceilinged room bathed in sunlight where you go to see and be seen. Ironically, I think Dinner might be a better place for lunch because the huge windows affords such attractive views of Hyde Park. The question then remains whether you can actually afford Dinner. Scanning the room, the restaurant seemed filled with well-heeled financiers, special-occasion diners, and suave older men spoiling their much-younger significant others.The cuisine at Dinner is decidedly modern British. Blumenthal pays homage to historic British gastronomy, dating all the way back to the 13th century, and reinvents them using modern techniques and preparations.The signature starter is the Meat Fruit (£18.50), and it's as playful as it is delicious. It looks exactly like an orange, but once you pierce its gelatinous ""peel"" you find that it's filled with a creamy chicken liver parfait. You will no doubt wonder how it was fabricated, and you will probably examine it the whole time you are eating it. But it's a wonderful dish, one that stimulates the mind as much as it does the palate.The beautifully-composed Lobster & Cucumber Soup (£25) is another delightful starter -- chilled lobster salad and smoked onion sitting on a cold rock samphire & sorrel soup. The flavors were clean and delicate, and the lobster was sweet and very fresh.For our main course, we ordered the Roast Iberico Pork Chop (£40) -- with pointy cabbage, onions & Robert sauce -- and the Powdered Duck Breast (£36) -- with smoked confit fennel, smoked beetroot, and umbles. The pork chop was the most rustic dish of our meal; it was thick, meaty, and smoky, and finished off with a drizzle of rich pork au jus. The duck was probably the most perfectly-cooked piece of duck I have ever had. It was incredibly moist and tender with a flawlessly crispy skin. And the fennel and beet accentuated the earthiness of the dish.The signature dessert here is the Tipsy Cake (£14.50), and it's a nice way to end the meal. It's a brioche baked in a sweet liqueur, then served with spit-roasted pineapple. The pineapple was more tart than sweet, but it provided a nice counterbalance to the cake. The only thing that would have made it better is a scoop of ice cream.If I had to fault my dining experience, it would be for this: nothing at Dinner was spontaneous. Everything, from the food to the service, seemed completely rehearsed. From the beginning to the end, everything was polished and flawlessly executed ... almost to a fault. It would have been nice, for example, had our server not been so formal with us. But even though I didn't find Dinner by Heston Blumenthal the warmest and most hospitable place, my dinner by Heston Blumenthal was nonetheless very impressive.4 1/2 stars"	set inside the edwardian styled mandarin oriental hotel  dinner by heston blumenthal immerses you into the sleek and sophisticated world of power dining  this is not an intimate two michelin star affair  where you can luxuriate in a romantic candlelit dinner  this is a stylish corporate affair in a high ceilinged room bathed in sunlight where you go to see and be seen  ironically  i think dinner might be a better place for lunch because the huge windows affords such attractive views of hyde park  the question then remains whether you can actually afford dinner  scanning the room  the restaurant seemed filled with well heeled financiers  special occasion diners  and suave older men spoiling their much younger significant others the cuisine at dinner is decidedly modern british  blumenthal pays homage to historic british gastronomy  dating all the way back to the 13th century  and reinvents them using modern techniques and preparations the signature starter is the meat fruit   18 50   and it s as playful as it is delicious  it looks exactly like an orange  but once you pierce its gelatinous  peel  you find that it s filled with a creamy chicken liver parfait  you will no doubt wonder how it was fabricated  and you will probably examine it the whole time you are eating it  but it s a wonderful dish  one that stimulates the mind as much as it does the palate the beautifully composed lobster   cucumber soup   25  is another delightful starter    chilled lobster salad and smoked onion sitting on a cold rock samphire   sorrel soup  the flavors were clean and delicate  and the lobster was sweet and very fresh for our main course  we ordered the roast iberico pork chop   40     with pointy cabbage  onions   robert sauce    and the powdered duck breast   36     with smoked confit fennel  smoked beetroot  and umbles  the pork chop was the most rustic dish of our meal  it was thick  meaty  and smoky  and finished off with a drizzle of rich pork au jus  the duck was probably the most perfectly cooked piece of duck i have ever had  it was incredibly moist and tender with a flawlessly crispy skin  and the fennel and beet accentuated the earthiness of the dish the signature dessert here is the tipsy cake   14 50   and it s a nice way to end the meal  it s a brioche baked in a sweet liqueur  then served with spit roasted pineapple  the pineapple was more tart than sweet  but it provided a nice counterbalance to the cake  the only thing that would have made it better is a scoop of ice cream if i had to fault my dining experience  it would be for this  nothing at dinner was spontaneous  everything  from the food to the service  seemed completely rehearsed  from the beginning to the end  everything was polished and flawlessly executed     almost to a fault  it would have been nice  for example  had our server not been so formal with us  but even though i didn t find dinner by heston blumenthal the warmest and most hospitable place  my dinner by heston blumenthal was nonetheless very impressive 4 1 2 stars
271	5.0	We were visiting at a time when there would be no Fat Duck...so we looked around and decided to get a seat at this restaurant. Located in the Mandarin Oriental (and thanks to that we saw a Porsche 918 spyder!! Were!!!), the food are all recreations of historic British recipes -- with the year of publishing printed next to each dish. While the dishes might sound commonplace, the presentation and taste certainly wasn't.The biggest takeaway from this meal is that it was surprisingly light. This is meant as a compliment - by the end of the meal, while everyone felt fulfilled, no one thought they were going to die of a food coma, and our palates weren't slammed to the extreme. It was just clean, crisp and fresh, a very interesting way of presenting contemporary British food.I started with the salamagundy (chicken oysters!), had the roast pork chops as my meal, and rounded the meal out with the sambocade (goat cheese cake with fruits and nuts). The chicken oysters were delicately layered amongst different greens, while my favourite part of the pork chops dish was the roasted cabbage. Who would have thought such a humble vegetable would be the star of the dish? The sambocade, while exotic sounding, turned out to be a refreshing dessert made of goat cheese, resembling more of a cheese plate rather than a heavy sugary dessert. All in all, the flavours of the dishes weren't groundbreaking, but the care put into cooking the side dishes and the assembly of the plates were exemplary. It is one of the finest examples of culinary excellence.	we were visiting at a time when there would be no fat duck   so we looked around and decided to get a seat at this restaurant  located in the mandarin oriental  and thanks to that we saw a porsche 918 spyder   were      the food are all recreations of historic british recipes    with the year of publishing printed next to each dish  while the dishes might sound commonplace  the presentation and taste certainly wasn t the biggest takeaway from this meal is that it was surprisingly light  this is meant as a compliment   by the end of the meal  while everyone felt fulfilled  no one thought they were going to die of a food coma  and our palates weren t slammed to the extreme  it was just clean  crisp and fresh  a very interesting way of presenting contemporary british food i started with the salamagundy  chicken oysters    had the roast pork chops as my meal  and rounded the meal out with the sambocade  goat cheese cake with fruits and nuts   the chicken oysters were delicately layered amongst different greens  while my favourite part of the pork chops dish was the roasted cabbage  who would have thought such a humble vegetable would be the star of the dish  the sambocade  while exotic sounding  turned out to be a refreshing dessert made of goat cheese  resembling more of a cheese plate rather than a heavy sugary dessert  all in all  the flavours of the dishes weren t groundbreaking  but the care put into cooking the side dishes and the assembly of the plates were exemplary  it is one of the finest examples of culinary excellence

But I think this comps very well to Michelin star completion.We started with the meatfruit and a seared scallop tartare.The meatfruit was quite special.  It's thick cut toast served in essence with chicken liver mousse (they call it parfait), but the presentation  is special.  It's wrapped in the thin skin of a mandarin orange.   I don't know how they do it... but hence meat fruit.  Super hearty food and really hit the spot.In contrast the scallops were delicate.  Roasted cauliflower and two scallops - thin seared and some raw tartare.  Very clean and refreshing.I got the heritage pork chop.  Prepared excellent in of itself, and also served with something that was vaguely reminiscent of dim sum (a rice paper covering some legumes and possibly meat).  Just done excellently.The duck also excellent.  I was left wondering if they sous vide.We also nabbed the twisty cake (if I remember correctly) which is a brioche in a cream/alcohol suave with a roasted caramelized pineapple.Wow what a meal	wow what an experience    excellent fare and service  and certainly didn t feel like we broke the bank  maybe the weak pound and my american dollars are a contributor   but i think this comps very well to michelin star completion we started with the meatfruit and a seared scallop tartare the meatfruit was quite special   it s thick cut toast served in essence with chicken liver mousse  they call it parfait   but the presentation  is special   it s wrapped in the thin skin of a mandarin orange    i don t know how they do it    but hence meat fruit   super hearty food and really hit the spot in contrast the scallops were delicate   roasted cauliflower and two scallops   thin seared and some raw tartare   very clean and refreshing i got the heritage pork chop   prepared excellent in of itself  and also served with something that was vaguely reminiscent of dim sum  a rice paper covering some legumes and possibly meat    just done excellently the duck also excellent   i was left wondering if they sous vide we also nabbed the twisty cake  if i remember correctly  which is a brioche in a cream alcohol suave with a roasted caramelized pineapple wow what a meal
273	5.0	A delicious meal with exceptional service. I can't praise their staff enough! Even though my boyfriend and I were greatly underdressed we still were treated kindly and when we called to tell them we were running late, they were understanding. The seating was beautiful, whether looking out or looking into the kitchen staff. Now the important part. The food was divine. Though my boyfriend has his hmph and meh about certain dishes (his duck and octopus dish), he was enamored with mine (Cod and risotto). Never have I enjoyed Cod as much as I had! And the desserts were perfect to top the meal with! I must also add, the decaffeinated espresso... Smooth, bold, rich, and tastes just as good as regular espresso.Was a perfect meal to end our trip in London.	a delicious meal with exceptional service  i can t praise their staff enough  even though my boyfriend and i were greatly underdressed we still were treated kindly and when we called to tell them we were running late  they were understanding  the seating was beautiful  whether looking out or looking into the kitchen staff  now the important part  the food was divine  though my boyfriend has his hmph and meh about certain dishes  his duck and octopus dish   he was enamored with mine  cod and risotto   never have i enjoyed cod as much as i had  and the desserts were perfect to top the meal with  i must also add  the decaffeinated espresso    smooth  bold  rich  and tastes just as good as regular espresso was a perfect meal to end our trip in london 
274	4.0	Came here for dinner and had the octopus for starters  and special beef rib for main dish. Unfortunately both dishes were served more on the colder side which did not make the meal appetizing. It took 45 mins to serve  the main dish after finishing my starter. I would of enjoyed a small cleansing palate in between meals.  By the time the main dish had arrived I was over the dinner.	came here for dinner and had the octopus for starters  and special beef rib for main dish  unfortunately both dishes were served more on the colder side which did not make the meal appetizing  it took 45 mins to serve  the main dish after finishing my starter  i would of enjoyed a small cleansing palate in between meals   by the time the main dish had arrived i was over the dinner

The menu was short but very much a storey that took many months to create focusing on inspiration gained from recipes as far back as those used by the Royal Courts of King Henry VIII, UK produce. What was interesting is finding Hereford on the menu coming from Asia and Australia where the craze is wagyu plu9 marble score in competition to Kobe beef.The lobster starter was so good followed with a large steak for two which was very tasty but tough	having previously been to fat duck heston s stake house is very different much more casual with a bar at the entrance  the menu was short but very much a storey that took many months to create focusing on inspiration gained from recipes as far back as those used by the royal courts of king henry viii  uk produce  what was interesting is finding hereford on the menu coming from asia and australia where the craze is wagyu plu9 marble score in competition to kobe beef the lobster starter was so good followed with a large steak for two which was very tasty but tough
276	5.0	Husband took me here for my birthday - complete surprise. I just knew that it would be somewhere special, just not sure where. Wow is all I can say. We were really taken care by our server, she was amazing. The cocktails were more than lovely, so lovely that the husband had 3.I loved the fact that our server (I won't say waitress, she was more than just a waitress) knew the menu, asked us if we have any food restrictions (I'm lactose-intolerant) and she made some suggestions based on that.Had the Salamagundy for starters (chicken oysters, salsify, bone marrow and some salad leaves), iberico pork chop for mains .. and dessert! We shared 3 between us - tipsy cake, brown bread ice cream and raspberry tart. OMFG that Tipsy Cake was to die for! So light, scrumptious, and so full of booze :-) The Brown Bread Ice Cream was interesting, not to my taste, but it was an interesting experience. I loved the Raspberry Tart, but after the Tipsy Cake it sadly had to come second.The wait staff were quite lovely, I got a little chocolate mousse cup with a birthday message on the plate. So lovely.Highly recommend. We were never rushed, the service was reserved and quiet, but still very pleasant and we felt like we were being taken care of.	husband took me here for my birthday   complete surprise  i just knew that it would be somewhere special  just not sure where  wow is all i can say  we were really taken care by our server  she was amazing  the cocktails were more than lovely  so lovely that the husband had 3 i loved the fact that our server  i won t say waitress  she was more than just a waitress  knew the menu  asked us if we have any food restrictions  i m lactose intolerant  and she made some suggestions based on that had the salamagundy for starters  chicken oysters  salsify  bone marrow and some salad leaves   iberico pork chop for mains    and dessert  we shared 3 between us   tipsy cake  brown bread ice cream and raspberry tart  omfg that tipsy cake was to die for  so light  scrumptious  and so full of booze     the brown bread ice cream was interesting  not to my taste  but it was an interesting experience  i loved the raspberry tart  but after the tipsy cake it sadly had to come second the wait staff were quite lovely  i got a little chocolate mousse cup with a birthday message on the plate  so lovely highly recommend  we were never rushed  the service was reserved and quiet  but still very pleasant and we felt like we were being taken care of 
277	5.0	I've been here twice now and it is definitely one of my favourite London restaurants and definitely deserves the two michelin stars.All the dishes are based on British historical dishes and original recipes from the 1300s through 1800s but of course with a modern twist.Atmosphere is pleasant (though it is within a hotel so does have that slightly hotel/corporate feel) and mostly couples or a few groups.Service is wonderful and attentive. They overheard me asking my fiance where the bathroom was so they escorted me there directly. What I love about it though is that the service is very relaxed and unfussy. Not snooty at all as it can be a bit in some michelin-starred places.And the food is wonderful. We only had a main and dessert as we knew how full we'd be otherwise. I had the roast halibut with roe and mussel/seaweed ketchup. So yummy and a well-cooked piece of fish. Also ordered a side of mashed potato which was ridiculously buttery and decadent. For dessert I had the 'chocolate bar' which is hard to describe but essentially a very dense dark chocolate mousse thing with a passion fruit layer served with lovely ginger ice cream. My fiance had the Tipsy cake which i highly recommend too - the lightest brioche ever with delicious grilled pineapple. Outstandning.	i ve been here twice now and it is definitely one of my favourite london restaurants and definitely deserves the two michelin stars all the dishes are based on british historical dishes and original recipes from the 1300s through 1800s but of course with a modern twist atmosphere is pleasant  though it is within a hotel so does have that slightly hotel corporate feel  and mostly couples or a few groups service is wonderful and attentive  they overheard me asking my fiance where the bathroom was so they escorted me there directly  what i love about it though is that the service is very relaxed and unfussy  not snooty at all as it can be a bit in some michelin starred places and the food is wonderful  we only had a main and dessert as we knew how full we d be otherwise  i had the roast halibut with roe and mussel seaweed ketchup  so yummy and a well cooked piece of fish  also ordered a side of mashed potato which was ridiculously buttery and decadent  for dessert i had the  chocolate bar  which is hard to describe but essentially a very dense dark chocolate mousse thing with a passion fruit layer served with lovely ginger ice cream  my fiance had the tipsy cake which i highly recommend too   the lightest brioche ever with delicious grilled pineapple  outstandning

279	5.0	"Dinner here ranks among my top three meals of all time, but sadly it's ""across the pond"" for me. I was disappointed that when we came to London, Fat Duck was closed for renovation. But Dinner made up for it, if not better. From the minute we walked in, everything was top notch. We were seated by the window with a view of Hyde Park, our servers were friendly, and knew us by names (probably because we were staying at the hotel). Menu was very interesting, the number after each item represents the year of the original recipe that chef got his inspiration from. Because they only offer tasting menu for Chef's table, which I believe is for 4 people only, we had to choose among all the yummy options on the menu. We had the meat fruit, seafood porridge, duck breast, and beef royale, which was actually part of the tasting menu, hence not part of the normal menu and they only offer limited quantities to the dinning room. Meat fruit lived up to the hype, and just when I was wondering how I was supposed to finish it with my one last bite of bread, they brought another piece of freshly toasted bread to the table. Talking about service! My duck breast was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly complimented by the jus and duck heart. My husband's beef royale, per him, is the best piece of beef he's ever had. Based on the look, the meat looked tough, but it melted in your mouth and exploded with flavors. Ashley Palmer-Watts is a genius.For dessert, of course we both got the tipsy cake. The tipsy cake itself was already good enough and balanced by the pineapple. But our lovely server recommended this dessert wine that brought out the sweetness of the cake even more. PLEASE ask for dessert wine recommendation to go with the tipsy cake, because I don't remember what we had. I promise you won't regret it.I really need to make an annual plan to return here, my wallet may hate me, but my stomach will thank me."	dinner here ranks among my top three meals of all time  but sadly it s  across the pond  for me  i was disappointed that when we came to london  fat duck was closed for renovation  but dinner made up for it  if not better  from the minute we walked in  everything was top notch  we were seated by the window with a view of hyde park  our servers were friendly  and knew us by names  probably because we were staying at the hotel   menu was very interesting  the number after each item represents the year of the original recipe that chef got his inspiration from  because they only offer tasting menu for chef s table  which i believe is for 4 people only  we had to choose among all the yummy options on the menu  we had the meat fruit  seafood porridge  duck breast  and beef royale  which was actually part of the tasting menu  hence not part of the normal menu and they only offer limited quantities to the dinning room  meat fruit lived up to the hype  and just when i was wondering how i was supposed to finish it with my one last bite of bread  they brought another piece of freshly toasted bread to the table  talking about service  my duck breast was perfectly cooked  perfectly seasoned  and perfectly complimented by the jus and duck heart  my husband s beef royale  per him  is the best piece of beef he s ever had  based on the look  the meat looked tough  but it melted in your mouth and exploded with flavors  ashley palmer watts is a genius for dessert  of course we both got the tipsy cake  the tipsy cake itself was already good enough and balanced by the pineapple  but our lovely server recommended this dessert wine that brought out the sweetness of the cake even more  please ask for dessert wine recommendation to go with the tipsy cake  because i don t remember what we had  i promise you won t regret it i really need to make an annual plan to return here  my wallet may hate me  but my stomach will thank me 
280	3.0	Dinner by Heston is a spacious, comfortable restaurant with an great outlook over Hyde Park. The menu is British in style and consists of carefully researched starters, mains and desserts referenced by their source of origin and approximate year of inspiration. Try, for example, Meat Fruit circa 1500, spiced pigeon circa 1780 and chase it down with Tipsy Cake circa 1810.Being my first experience at Dinner, I opted for the Express Lunch menu.  A decent 3.5 stars my book.  Very good, but not great for a restaurant touted to be no 5 in the world. The Ragoo of Pigs Ears on Toast was absolutely delicious.  Melt in your mouth, rich in flavour.The slow roast pork belly was disappointing.  The layer of fat beneath the skin wasn't at all silky smooth and was quite gristly and difficult to digest. I was expecting melt in your mouth brilliance.The Shrewsbury Goose Tansy Tart was fine.  Something that you could expect to pick up from your high street bakery.That said, the table service was exceptional and was very apologetic to the wait time being entree and main course being served.A great experience overall, but nothing magical.	dinner by heston is a spacious  comfortable restaurant with an great outlook over hyde park  the menu is british in style and consists of carefully researched starters  mains and desserts referenced by their source of origin and approximate year of inspiration  try  for example  meat fruit circa 1500  spiced pigeon circa 1780 and chase it down with tipsy cake circa 1810 being my first experience at dinner  i opted for the express lunch menu   a decent 3 5 stars my book   very good  but not great for a restaurant touted to be no 5 in the world  the ragoo of pigs ears on toast was absolutely delicious   melt in your mouth  rich in flavour the slow roast pork belly was disappointing   the layer of fat beneath the skin wasn t at all silky smooth and was quite gristly and difficult to digest  i was expecting melt in your mouth brilliance the shrewsbury goose tansy tart was fine   something that you could expect to pick up from your high street bakery that said  the table service was exceptional and was very apologetic to the wait time being entree and main course being served a great experience overall  but nothing magical 
281	3.0	Dinner by Heston is really somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.The restaurant has a nice location right by Hyde Park in the Mandarin Oriental hotel with classic modern upscale restaurant decorations (though I must point out that their lamps on the sides of the walls look like bundt cake pans). I went with my family and we ordered a la carte. All of the starters were absolutely fantastic and far better than the mains. We had the earl grey tea cured salmon, grilled octopus, and savoury porridge. The salmon was amazing (the best part of the whole dinner!), and the octopus was grilled to perfection.The mains, however, were fairly average. We had the spiced pigeon, cod in cider, and roasted halibut with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans and shallots. The halibut was probably the best of the bunch. It came with a really refreshing parsley and eucalyptus sauce. The cod was a bit cloying and though we ordered the pigeon well done, it came out more red than we would have liked. I was a little disappointed by the few options for sides.We had the rhubarb and hibiscus and taffety tart for dessert. Both were good, but neither was extremely memorable.I loved the glass of Gruner Veltliner that I had and am extremely sad that I didn't get a picture of the label. I also love that they had my favorite moscato (La Spinetta) because I don't see it as often as I'd like to.Overall Dinner by Heston is definitely worth checking out once. I like the historical concept, but think that might have limited the mains and sides - the starters were a little more inventive and were just so much better.	dinner by heston is really somewhere between 3 and 4 stars the restaurant has a nice location right by hyde park in the mandarin oriental hotel with classic modern upscale restaurant decorations  though i must point out that their lamps on the sides of the walls look like bundt cake pans   i went with my family and we ordered a la carte  all of the starters were absolutely fantastic and far better than the mains  we had the earl grey tea cured salmon  grilled octopus  and savoury porridge  the salmon was amazing  the best part of the whole dinner    and the octopus was grilled to perfection the mains  however  were fairly average  we had the spiced pigeon  cod in cider  and roasted halibut with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans and shallots  the halibut was probably the best of the bunch  it came with a really refreshing parsley and eucalyptus sauce  the cod was a bit cloying and though we ordered the pigeon well done  it came out more red than we would have liked  i was a little disappointed by the few options for sides we had the rhubarb and hibiscus and taffety tart for dessert  both were good  but neither was extremely memorable i loved the glass of gruner veltliner that i had and am extremely sad that i didn t get a picture of the label  i also love that they had my favorite moscato  la spinetta  because i don t see it as often as i d like to overall dinner by heston is definitely worth checking out once  i like the historical concept  but think that might have limited the mains and sides   the starters were a little more inventive and were just so much better 
282	5.0	Absolutely tops!  We did the tasting table with a very foodie friend in town from NYC and beginning to end everything was delicious, beautiful, delicate and so very English!  The elevation of historical British food made the experience different compared to a lot of the other microgastronomy I've had which has largely been rooted in French, Californian or Japanese flavors.The tasting table itself, set back in front of the cold larder with a view of the hot larder was comfortable and visually stimulating.  Dinner was well paced (we took the full four hours but never a dull moment) and it was wonderful to have various chefs come out and explain each part of the meal, and the sommelier did a wonderful job of selecting wines. The salmon, octopus, meat fruit and tipsycake were standouts but honestly I loved everything.  If I had the ££££££ I'd bring everyone here!	absolutely tops   we did the tasting table with a very foodie friend in town from nyc and beginning to end everything was delicious  beautiful  delicate and so very english   the elevation of historical british food made the experience different compared to a lot of the other microgastronomy i ve had which has largely been rooted in french  californian or japanese flavors the tasting table itself  set back in front of the cold larder with a view of the hot larder was comfortable and visually stimulating   dinner was well paced  we took the full four hours but never a dull moment  and it was wonderful to have various chefs come out and explain each part of the meal  and the sommelier did a wonderful job of selecting wines  the salmon  octopus  meat fruit and tipsycake were standouts but honestly i loved everything   if i had the        i d bring everyone here

Also the pineapple dessert that takes over 5 hours is very special. Service amazing! I'm have reservations to return here again I like it so much! Nice ambiance, I like sitting close to the kitchen, it's interesting to see how things are prepare.	my absolute favorite restaurant in london  it s busy  food is great and well thought out  the meat fruit sounds awful but it s a must  also the pineapple dessert that takes over 5 hours is very special  service amazing  i m have reservations to return here again i like it so much  nice ambiance  i like sitting close to the kitchen  it s interesting to see how things are prepare

And I'll even tell you what to order ;) meat fruit and the Salmagundy for appetizers, the rib eye for dinner and the tipsy cake for dessert. They were amazing!!! The meat fruit is a soft and non-pungent pate of duck liver covered by this magical orange shell that disintegrates in your mouth. The Salmagundy is chicken oysters prepared in a brilliant way. Service was impeccable. I had to crack a few jokes with the waiters and they responded ;)Make a reservation way ahead. It's worth it.

286	5.0	This was an outstanding meal-- one of the best experiences I've had. I wanted to try everything but eventually narrowed it down to 4 things (3 things would have easily left me full, 4 left me stuffed):- Meat fruit-- this is basically a must-get.  Others have described its merits. I agree.- Salamagundy- delicious, interesting, inventive, unique, beautifully presented. There was panko crusted bone marrow, which was novel, interesting, and delicious, in addition to carmelized and perfectly cooked chicken oysters (my favorite part of the bird!)- Cod in cider- delicious, perfectly cooked, tender, flaky, rich, and buttery. The roasted artichokes and onions were particularly tasty.- Tipsy cake- another must-get. Delicious, soaked in a buttery sauce with just the perfect spike of alcohol.The prices of the cocktails were a bit high for my American dollars (£17-18 each), especially since that's the same price as the meat fruit and other starters.  I stuck with wine which started around £12-13/glass, and beers were in the £7-8 if you were interested in starting the night with something less expensive.The food AND service here are well-deserving of its accolades as one of the best restaurants in the world, and the prices are well worth the food and experience. I was in town for business, so I dined on my own, and the service was spectacular.  The people taking care of me struck the perfect balance of chatting with me and socializing, and leaving me to enjoy my food.  Unequivocally recommended.	this was an outstanding meal   one of the best experiences i ve had  i wanted to try everything but eventually narrowed it down to 4 things  3 things would have easily left me full  4 left me stuffed    meat fruit   this is basically a must get   others have described its merits  i agree   salamagundy  delicious  interesting  inventive  unique  beautifully presented  there was panko crusted bone marrow  which was novel  interesting  and delicious  in addition to carmelized and perfectly cooked chicken oysters  my favorite part of the bird    cod in cider  delicious  perfectly cooked  tender  flaky  rich  and buttery  the roasted artichokes and onions were particularly tasty   tipsy cake  another must get  delicious  soaked in a buttery sauce with just the perfect spike of alcohol the prices of the cocktails were a bit high for my american dollars   17 18 each   especially since that s the same price as the meat fruit and other starters   i stuck with wine which started around  12 13 glass  and beers were in the  7 8 if you were interested in starting the night with something less expensive the food and service here are well deserving of its accolades as one of the best restaurants in the world  and the prices are well worth the food and experience  i was in town for business  so i dined on my own  and the service was spectacular   the people taking care of me struck the perfect balance of chatting with me and socializing  and leaving me to enjoy my food   unequivocally recommended

288	5.0	In the case of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, 5 stars is not enough. My family and I came here for my birthday dinner and it was by far one of the best meals that I have ever had.The atmosphere of the restaurant is ever so slightly corporate, but also inviting and modern. As many other reviewers have mentioned, and as you may have noticed from a perusal of the menu, Heston's is far from normal. The restaurant takes dishes that were once very popular (think 14th-19th c.) and repurposes them into plates for the modern palate. The names of the menu items are simple and give a hint to what the dish will be like. For dinner we got:Appetizers: Meat Fruit, Rice and Flesh, Roast MarrowEntrées: Roast Iberico Pork Chop, Powdered Duck Breast, Hereford Ribeye, Chicken cooked with LettucesDessert: Tipsy Cake, Sambocade, Taffety TartPost: Earl Grey Chocolate Mousse (mine had 'Happy Birthday' written on it, nice touch)All of the dishes were amazing and each person thought that his/her own dish was the best. Following that logic, my favorites were the Rice and Flesh (probably my favorite of the night), the Pork Chop, and the Tipsy Cake. The Meat Fruit was also very good. A little confusing at first, but the flavors and textures played well together. Also, the Tipsy Cake deserves its own special mention for being delectable.Bottom-line: You will most certainly not be disappointed when you dine at Heston's. The food is unforgettable and innovative in the best way possible and the service is top notch. You will regret not making a trip here.	in the case of dinner by heston blumenthal  5 stars is not enough  my family and i came here for my birthday dinner and it was by far one of the best meals that i have ever had the atmosphere of the restaurant is ever so slightly corporate  but also inviting and modern  as many other reviewers have mentioned  and as you may have noticed from a perusal of the menu  heston s is far from normal  the restaurant takes dishes that were once very popular  think 14th 19th c   and repurposes them into plates for the modern palate  the names of the menu items are simple and give a hint to what the dish will be like  for dinner we got appetizers  meat fruit  rice and flesh  roast marrowentr es  roast iberico pork chop  powdered duck breast  hereford ribeye  chicken cooked with lettucesdessert  tipsy cake  sambocade  taffety tartpost  earl grey chocolate mousse  mine had  happy birthday  written on it  nice touch all of the dishes were amazing and each person thought that his her own dish was the best  following that logic  my favorites were the rice and flesh  probably my favorite of the night   the pork chop  and the tipsy cake  the meat fruit was also very good  a little confusing at first  but the flavors and textures played well together  also  the tipsy cake deserves its own special mention for being delectable bottom line  you will most certainly not be disappointed when you dine at heston s  the food is unforgettable and innovative in the best way possible and the service is top notch  you will regret not making a trip here 
289	3.0	Ladies and gents, this place.... ! This place had been on my bucket list for the better part of twelve minutes and... what, we know I'm spoiled and I get what I want when I want it, which is NOW, ok? Anyway, so. With my family in town we decided to get reservations for the lot of us and go sample Heston's genius at the Mandarin, and wanted - and I mean CRAVED- being impressed from the get go. To put my review into context, here's a nugget: to date, I've been to close to 40 Michelin starred restaurants globally, and some incredible ones in London. When you go to a 2-star, you expect lottery winning in your mouth. You expect to see sounds, to speak tongues, to feel your insides deliciously twist in that high-school-prom-night-crush way... And this wasn't it. It was good food, mind you. We were 7, so we tried EVERYTHING. The meat fruit was literally just pate in the shape of a tangerine. The frumenty was slightly underwhelming... however, the Savoury Porridge was OUT OF THIS WORLD delish. The duck was cooked to perfection, and it was tender and moist and crisp... but just a duck. The Ribeye was great, but again... just a steak. The pigeon was really delish. As for desserts... all above average ( we had EVERY single one except for the ice cream in the cart) but the Tipsy Cake was INSANE, like unreal. Literally the best thing to ever fall in my mouth ever like EVER. So all in all... I wouldnt go back honestly, it's really expensive and kind of underwhelming for what it is. I much preferred Gordon's Maze for a 2 star...	ladies and gents  this place       this place had been on my bucket list for the better part of twelve minutes and    what  we know i m spoiled and i get what i want when i want it  which is now  ok  anyway  so  with my family in town we decided to get reservations for the lot of us and go sample heston s genius at the mandarin  and wanted   and i mean craved  being impressed from the get go  to put my review into context  here s a nugget  to date  i ve been to close to 40 michelin starred restaurants globally  and some incredible ones in london  when you go to a 2 star  you expect lottery winning in your mouth  you expect to see sounds  to speak tongues  to feel your insides deliciously twist in that high school prom night crush way    and this wasn t it  it was good food  mind you  we were 7  so we tried everything  the meat fruit was literally just pate in the shape of a tangerine  the frumenty was slightly underwhelming    however  the savoury porridge was out of this world delish  the duck was cooked to perfection  and it was tender and moist and crisp    but just a duck  the ribeye was great  but again    just a steak  the pigeon was really delish  as for desserts    all above average   we had every single one except for the ice cream in the cart  but the tipsy cake was insane  like unreal  literally the best thing to ever fall in my mouth ever like ever  so all in all    i wouldnt go back honestly  it s really expensive and kind of underwhelming for what it is  i much preferred gordon s maze for a 2 star   
290	5.0	I came here when I was visiting London over spring break.  When I entered the restaurant, I was really impressed with the modern interior and the ambiance.  At my table, you could see into the kitchen, which was a fun part of the meal.  The theme of the restaurant is really cool-- all the dishes are based on recipes from the 14th-19th centuries.  As is typical of Michelin star restaurants, the service is impeccable.  Our wine glasses were never empty, and at some point in the meal, I sneezed -- within 10 seconds, a waiter appeared with a box of tissues.Listen to all the other reviewers and get the meat fruit.  Besides having a cute and whimsical presentation, the meat fruit is probably the best thing I've ever eaten.  The combination of flavors (mandarin, pate) blend extremely well together.  For my entree, I got the the Hereford ribeye, which was a really nicely cooked steak.  For dessert, definitely go with the tipsy cake (spit roast pineapple and brioche).  Order it at the beginning of your meal (it takes 40 minutes to cook).  The brioche is super light, and literally melt-in-your-mouth good.  My friend got the rhubarb and hibiscus dessert, which is refreshing and good to get if you are too stuffed for the more filling tipsy cake.I would definitely fly back to London just to eat at this restaurant!	i came here when i was visiting london over spring break   when i entered the restaurant  i was really impressed with the modern interior and the ambiance   at my table  you could see into the kitchen  which was a fun part of the meal   the theme of the restaurant is really cool   all the dishes are based on recipes from the 14th 19th centuries   as is typical of michelin star restaurants  the service is impeccable   our wine glasses were never empty  and at some point in the meal  i sneezed    within 10 seconds  a waiter appeared with a box of tissues listen to all the other reviewers and get the meat fruit   besides having a cute and whimsical presentation  the meat fruit is probably the best thing i ve ever eaten   the combination of flavors  mandarin  pate  blend extremely well together   for my entree  i got the the hereford ribeye  which was a really nicely cooked steak   for dessert  definitely go with the tipsy cake  spit roast pineapple and brioche    order it at the beginning of your meal  it takes 40 minutes to cook    the brioche is super light  and literally melt in your mouth good   my friend got the rhubarb and hibiscus dessert  which is refreshing and good to get if you are too stuffed for the more filling tipsy cake i would definitely fly back to london just to eat at this restaurant 
291	5.0	This is my 4th Michelin Star restaurant, and this is by far the nicest presentable establishment.  The big open space, decor and lighting, and big window sills facing the park makes this a truly fine dining experience.  Service was of course excellent and food was fantastic.~A P P E T I Z E R S~LOBSTER & CUCUMBER SOUP - 4 stars - Lobster salad, smoked onion, rock samphire & sorrel.  Lobster was fresh with a great and delicious, and the cucumber sauce gave it a nice kick.  Great appetizer, recommend!MEAT FRUIT - 4.5 stars - this was great.  Foie Gras spread on the toasted bread was fantastic.  The spread alone was too rich, but on the bread was just perfect, and our servers brought more when we asked. Definitely a must order when coming to Dinner. The meat fruit is shaped liked a mandarin orange to give thanks to the Mandarin Hotel, which is where this restaurant is located.  Clever, eh? ~M A I N S ~ SLOW COOKED PORK BELLY - 4 stars - Yum!  Peas pudding, bacon, and mint oil from Tuscany Italy.  The slow cooked pork belly was extremely tender, and combining with the peas pudding, mint oil, and chicaron was a great taste combination.  I don't even like peas!  But it complemented well with this delicate dish. ~D E S S E R T S~CHOCOLATE BAR - 4 stars - Passion fruit jam and ginger ice cream.  It was a pretty simple dessert, but nevertheless good. TIPSY CAKE - 5 stars - MUST order!! My boyfriend thought it was too sweet, but I don't even have a sweet tooth and I loved this!! Warm, creamy brioche that was epic in rich flavor and had the sweetness of the pineapple that has been roasting for at least 4 hours.  Mmm, the best for last.

292	2.0	"Dinner by Heston Blumenthal:Knowing of the infamous Heston Blumenthal and his edible wizardry, I desired to sample his cuisine while traveling to London. Originally, I desired to dine at The Fat Duck, but sadly, I learned that it was not due to return to Bray until the end of September 2015; we visited the UK a few weeks too soon! In any event, we decided that dining at Dinner by Heston should satisfy out gastronomic cravings. We dined in September 2015. Our experience was tepid overall.  We enjoyed the food, yet we felt that aside from the iconic classics- Meat Fruit and Tipsy Cake- the food was not extraordinary.  The service was also patchy and unexpected. We were abandoned throughout our meal and felt like an afterthought. While we dined at 9:45pm, the time of night should be irrelevant; the staff should be as attentive at 10:00pm as they are at six in the evening.  Our water glasses were filled once initially and then never again, remaining empty throughout the meal. Upon ordering dessert, the waiter informed us that they had run out of certain options-- absolutely unacceptable for a Two Michelin Star establishment. I had such high hopes for Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, but I'm left with a sense of disappointment. See below for a more complete review. Reservations:We had a full day of activities planned in London, so I imagined 9:45 in the evening would work well with our schedule. Upon arrival, we were kept waiting and were not seated until 10:00pm. The restaurant appeared rather empty, and the wait staff seemed exhausted. Décor:The restaurant itself is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The dining room was large and open with high ceilings. The kitchen was adjacent and with near floor-to-ceiling, you could peer into the kitchen, although it was rather quiet at that time of night. Libations:We ordered a glass of unremarkable red wine to sip throughout our dinner. Bread:The rustic sourdough bread with English farmhouse butter was average. I wish they had a bread trolley or a more extensive selection. Appetizers:The 16th Century Meat Fruit was the most exquisite dish of the evening. It is Blumenthal's signature dish here, and it exceeded expectations. The foie gras was velvety and unlike any I've ever had. The staff did replace the accompanying bread- one of their only attentive acts of the evening. The late 14th Century Frumenty octopus had a nice flavor and was enjoyed. We also tried the 18th Century Salamagundy chicken oysters, and we found them to be excessively fried and salty. Entrées: The late 17th Century Powdered Duck Breast was cooked to perfection- still quite rare and tender. The accompanying fennel and spiced beetroot were also a nice touch. The duck was draped in a rather thick, chewy layer of fat, which was a bit much for me. Furthermore, dare I say that the portion was too large; this should have been an appetizer, as halfway through, I was longing for some new favors. The early 19 Century Roast Iberico Pork Chop was too well-done and very dry. Neither entrée was stunning, but the duck was the better of the two. Dessert:My disappointment culminated when attempting to order dessert. Our server informed us that they simply ""ran out"" of their new, popular dessert, Beekeeper's Chocolate. An esteemed two Michelin star establishment should never ""run out"" of something, let alone a popular dish. The disappointment was further compounded when I was told that there is a minimum order or two when requesting the infamous nitro ice cream; unacceptable once again in my eyes. The server should have made an exception, especially as he was unable to provide my first selection of the Beekeeper's! My dining companions only wanted to share my dessert selection, so we all nibbled on the famed Tipsy Cake. This dessert was truly exceptional. The hype is true, and this dessert must be ordered.  Service:As a well-versed gourmand, the service we received was not even of a one Michelin star establishment. Our water glasses remained empty throughout our entire meal, never once being checked on. We felt abandoned and a bother to the staff, whom appeared more than eager to retire to their flats for the evening. Summary:Heston Blumenthal's iconic dishes certainly deserved high accolades. The Meat Fruit and Tipsy Cake were extraordinary. The device left a lot to be desired, and I am left puzzled, since this establishment has been ranked among the top ten for several years, according to San Pellegrino World's Best. My Recommendation:Go. Heston Blumenthal's iconic dishes alone would draw me back in.  I hope that my rather cold experience with the staff was uncharacteristic and a fluke, which should never happen for an establishment to this caliber. If I have the opportunity again in the future, I will return. 2 starsMichelin Stars: Two (2016)San Pellegrino World's Best: #7 (2015)"	dinner by heston blumenthal knowing of the infamous heston blumenthal and his edible wizardry  i desired to sample his cuisine while traveling to london  originally  i desired to dine at the fat duck  but sadly  i learned that it was not due to return to bray until the end of september 2015  we visited the uk a few weeks too soon  in any event  we decided that dining at dinner by heston should satisfy out gastronomic cravings  we dined in september 2015  our experience was tepid overall   we enjoyed the food  yet we felt that aside from the iconic classics  meat fruit and tipsy cake  the food was not extraordinary   the service was also patchy and unexpected  we were abandoned throughout our meal and felt like an afterthought  while we dined at 9 45pm  the time of night should be irrelevant  the staff should be as attentive at 10 00pm as they are at six in the evening   our water glasses were filled once initially and then never again  remaining empty throughout the meal  upon ordering dessert  the waiter informed us that they had run out of certain options   absolutely unacceptable for a two michelin star establishment  i had such high hopes for dinner by heston blumenthal  but i m left with a sense of disappointment  see below for a more complete review  reservations we had a full day of activities planned in london  so i imagined 9 45 in the evening would work well with our schedule  upon arrival  we were kept waiting and were not seated until 10 00pm  the restaurant appeared rather empty  and the wait staff seemed exhausted  d cor the restaurant itself is inside the mandarin oriental hotel  the dining room was large and open with high ceilings  the kitchen was adjacent and with near floor to ceiling  you could peer into the kitchen  although it was rather quiet at that time of night  libations we ordered a glass of unremarkable red wine to sip throughout our dinner  bread the rustic sourdough bread with english farmhouse butter was average  i wish they had a bread trolley or a more extensive selection  appetizers the 16th century meat fruit was the most exquisite dish of the evening  it is blumenthal s signature dish here  and it exceeded expectations  the foie gras was velvety and unlike any i ve ever had  the staff did replace the accompanying bread  one of their only attentive acts of the evening  the late 14th century frumenty octopus had a nice flavor and was enjoyed  we also tried the 18th century salamagundy chicken oysters  and we found them to be excessively fried and salty  entr es  the late 17th century powdered duck breast was cooked to perfection  still quite rare and tender  the accompanying fennel and spiced beetroot were also a nice touch  the duck was draped in a rather thick  chewy layer of fat  which was a bit much for me  furthermore  dare i say that the portion was too large  this should have been an appetizer  as halfway through  i was longing for some new favors  the early 19 century roast iberico pork chop was too well done and very dry  neither entr e was stunning  but the duck was the better of the two  dessert my disappointment culminated when attempting to order dessert  our server informed us that they simply  ran out  of their new  popular dessert  beekeeper s chocolate  an esteemed two michelin star establishment should never  run out  of something  let alone a popular dish  the disappointment was further compounded when i was told that there is a minimum order or two when requesting the infamous nitro ice cream  unacceptable once again in my eyes  the server should have made an exception  especially as he was unable to provide my first selection of the beekeeper s  my dining companions only wanted to share my dessert selection  so we all nibbled on the famed tipsy cake  this dessert was truly exceptional  the hype is true  and this dessert must be ordered   service as a well versed gourmand  the service we received was not even of a one michelin star establishment  our water glasses remained empty throughout our entire meal  never once being checked on  we felt abandoned and a bother to the staff  whom appeared more than eager to retire to their flats for the evening  summary heston blumenthal s iconic dishes certainly deserved high accolades  the meat fruit and tipsy cake were extraordinary  the device left a lot to be desired  and i am left puzzled  since this establishment has been ranked among the top ten for several years  according to san pellegrino world s best  my recommendation go  heston blumenthal s iconic dishes alone would draw me back in   i hope that my rather cold experience with the staff was uncharacteristic and a fluke  which should never happen for an establishment to this caliber  if i have the opportunity again in the future  i will return  2 starsmichelin stars  two  2016 san pellegrino world s best   7  2015 
293	2.0	Had dinner at Dinner. Great location in the heart of Knightsbridge inside the Mandarin Oriental with a Michelin star by Heston Blumenthal so there are some expectations it had to live up to.Unfortunately it was overhyped. The inside is very modern and service is indeed spectacular. However, all of the dishes we ordered (we ordered a variety on the menu) was good but not special. I was really disappointed as the flavour didn't really have a 'pop'.  We could have been eating at our local gastropub.  The only dish which had a unique taste was the pineapple dessert.  Even the ice cream which was made in front of you with dry ice was all show and no go - nothing unique about it.Their cocktails were good as well - but again, nothing too spectacular given the other options at the cocktail bars around London. Unfortunately I won't be coming here again.	had dinner at dinner  great location in the heart of knightsbridge inside the mandarin oriental with a michelin star by heston blumenthal so there are some expectations it had to live up to unfortunately it was overhyped  the inside is very modern and service is indeed spectacular  however  all of the dishes we ordered  we ordered a variety on the menu  was good but not special  i was really disappointed as the flavour didn t really have a  pop    we could have been eating at our local gastropub   the only dish which had a unique taste was the pineapple dessert   even the ice cream which was made in front of you with dry ice was all show and no go   nothing unique about it their cocktails were good as well   but again  nothing too spectacular given the other options at the cocktail bars around london  unfortunately i won t be coming here again 
294	5.0	Wow.FoodThis may be the best food iveever eaten. I literally had to stop my friend from talking because the flavour was so rich I needed to concentrate on tasting it. I had the meat fruit, which was like intensely flavoursome pate. The duck was perfectly cooked. Don't both with the sides as it was all very heavy in butter and fat that there was no space. I have to say the carrots were a little too sweet and potato was so smooth it bared to resemblance to potato. The tipsy cake was like sweet fluffy broiche with a treacleesque yummness.Atmosphere It was formal but not pretentious. Open but intimate if you liked. Nothing of note. A clean nice restaurant Service.Amazing.beginning to end, explanations, politeness, friendly, incredibly apologetic when they took a while with my white tea. I came in trainers and noone cared AdditionalThey gave me and my friend an extra Earl Grey desert because it was my birthday See photos	wow foodthis may be the best food iveever eaten  i literally had to stop my friend from talking because the flavour was so rich i needed to concentrate on tasting it  i had the meat fruit  which was like intensely flavoursome pate  the duck was perfectly cooked  don t both with the sides as it was all very heavy in butter and fat that there was no space  i have to say the carrots were a little too sweet and potato was so smooth it bared to resemblance to potato  the tipsy cake was like sweet fluffy broiche with a treacleesque yummness atmosphere it was formal but not pretentious  open but intimate if you liked  nothing of note  a clean nice restaurant service amazing beginning to end  explanations  politeness  friendly  incredibly apologetic when they took a while with my white tea  i came in trainers and noone cared additionalthey gave me and my friend an extra earl grey desert because it was my birthday see photos
295	5.0	A dinner out in London on our multi-part trip around the UK, we were very excited to eat at Heston Blumenthal's flagship restaurant in the Mandarin hotel in London. We were particularly excited due to the historical creative roots that he derived the menu from. The restaurant guests were primarily a mix of romantic couples, business associates, and a smattering of vastly under-dressed tourist families. The staff were at first worryingly young for such a highly praised eatery, but we found them to be delightfully professional, knowledgeable, and charismatic throughout the meal. The food was fantastic, the oxtail and rice was delightful, the cocktails from Mandarin's bar also great. A great standout dish was the mashed potatoes, so buttery and creamy they have ruined our expectations of mashed potatoes forever. Our only complaint was the kitchen's 'extra' treat of some pudding and biscotti that was too eerily similar to a Jell-O Pudding Cup.In hindsight this was the only restaurant on our UK trip that were trending with top places in the US, whereas fine-dining in the other parts of the UK were still smearing pastes on your plate or serving sorbets, Blumenthal was embracing the quality and energy that make it stand out in a sea of obsolesce. And although it doesn't have the pomp of a 13 course meal at Eleven Madison Park or the inventiveness of the now-defunct WD50's molecular gastronomic concoctions , it does deliver on dishes that shine fantastically on their own.Overall, the highlight of our London trip, amazing food, great staff, and fantastic value. Eat well, drink the Mandarin cocktails (forgo the wine), and enjoy possibly the best restaurant in the British Empire.	a dinner out in london on our multi part trip around the uk  we were very excited to eat at heston blumenthal s flagship restaurant in the mandarin hotel in london  we were particularly excited due to the historical creative roots that he derived the menu from  the restaurant guests were primarily a mix of romantic couples  business associates  and a smattering of vastly under dressed tourist families  the staff were at first worryingly young for such a highly praised eatery  but we found them to be delightfully professional  knowledgeable  and charismatic throughout the meal  the food was fantastic  the oxtail and rice was delightful  the cocktails from mandarin s bar also great  a great standout dish was the mashed potatoes  so buttery and creamy they have ruined our expectations of mashed potatoes forever  our only complaint was the kitchen s  extra  treat of some pudding and biscotti that was too eerily similar to a jell o pudding cup in hindsight this was the only restaurant on our uk trip that were trending with top places in the us  whereas fine dining in the other parts of the uk were still smearing pastes on your plate or serving sorbets  blumenthal was embracing the quality and energy that make it stand out in a sea of obsolesce  and although it doesn t have the pomp of a 13 course meal at eleven madison park or the inventiveness of the now defunct wd50 s molecular gastronomic concoctions   it does deliver on dishes that shine fantastically on their own overall  the highlight of our london trip  amazing food  great staff  and fantastic value  eat well  drink the mandarin cocktails  forgo the wine   and enjoy possibly the best restaurant in the british empire

297	5.0	"Dinner definitely deserves its 2 Michelin stars. Located in the Mandarin Oriental, the ambiance is sophisticated, yet relaxed and not stuffy. Glass encases the plethora of wine bottles on both sides as you enter, as well as the kitchen for you to peek into as they do their magic. The menu is a modern take on original British dishes. I'm going to sound like a broken record, but yes indeed, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not getting the meat fruit! I've had quite a bit of pâté in my life--this sits in the #1 spot! Covered in a mandarin jelly, this smooth chicken liver melts in your mouth and leaves a lasting impression. The lobster & cucumber soup is delectable as well, with a light consistency and flavors that blend well together. The cod in cider is one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The cod falls apart and has a beautiful buttery flavor. It pairs well with the chard and smoked artichokes. The Hereford ribeye is a solid choice. I found it to be somewhat chewy, but the beef is of the utmost quality. Their triple cooked chips are essentially very crispy fries. The mushroom ""ketchup"" is interesting! If you're up for dessert, don't think about it, just get the tipsy cake--make sure to order it at the beginning of your meal. This unassuming dessert is really something that blew me away. It is one of the best little desserts I've ever had. Their liquid nitrogen ice cream station is interesting to observe, but it melts quickly! Just a few toppings to choose from, but there is a strawberry preserve treat at the bottom of the cone that's a nice touch and excellent last bite to an excellent meal. Service is outstanding of course. Portions aren't huge, but neither are the prices--for the 7th best-ranked restaurant in the world, that is."	dinner definitely deserves its 2 michelin stars  located in the mandarin oriental  the ambiance is sophisticated  yet relaxed and not stuffy  glass encases the plethora of wine bottles on both sides as you enter  as well as the kitchen for you to peek into as they do their magic  the menu is a modern take on original british dishes  i m going to sound like a broken record  but yes indeed  you d be doing yourself a disservice by not getting the meat fruit  i ve had quite a bit of p t  in my life  this sits in the  1 spot  covered in a mandarin jelly  this smooth chicken liver melts in your mouth and leaves a lasting impression  the lobster   cucumber soup is delectable as well  with a light consistency and flavors that blend well together  the cod in cider is one of the best fish dishes i ve ever had  the cod falls apart and has a beautiful buttery flavor  it pairs well with the chard and smoked artichokes  the hereford ribeye is a solid choice  i found it to be somewhat chewy  but the beef is of the utmost quality  their triple cooked chips are essentially very crispy fries  the mushroom  ketchup  is interesting  if you re up for dessert  don t think about it  just get the tipsy cake  make sure to order it at the beginning of your meal  this unassuming dessert is really something that blew me away  it is one of the best little desserts i ve ever had  their liquid nitrogen ice cream station is interesting to observe  but it melts quickly  just a few toppings to choose from  but there is a strawberry preserve treat at the bottom of the cone that s a nice touch and excellent last bite to an excellent meal  service is outstanding of course  portions aren t huge  but neither are the prices  for the 7th best ranked restaurant in the world  that is 
298	5.0	"We had dinner here. The ambience and service were excellent. The waiter explained the menu in detail extensively and answered all questions we had. Starters: The meat fruit, Frumenty and Earl Grey tea cured salmon.The meat fruit was definitely the star of this course. It was perfectly presented. The foies gras was smooth and luscious. The grilled octopus, the ""Frumenty"" was fresh and tender but the general taste of the dish was nothing you would not be able to find in a good seafood tavern in a Mediterranean country. That said, I've found it difficult to find well-cooked octopus in this country so they still deserve their five stars. The salmon was very fresh and mouthwatering.Main: Powdered duck breast and chicken cooked with lettuces. I wasn't a fan of the chicken. However, the duck was divine. It was cooked to perfection, well-seasoned and scrumptious. Just perfect. Desserts and tea: Tipsy cake, Brown bread ice cream, Chocolate bar and Sambocade. There was a great selection of teas, I'd recommend the rose tea. The tipsy cake was absolutely gorgeous. You'd have to pre-order it as it takes 40 minutes to prepare. However it is one of the best desserts I have ever had. For an ice cream addict like myself, the brown bread ice cream was average. The chocolate bar and ginger ice cream were good but the bar was a bit too overpowering. The Sambocade was different and worth trying but a dessert I would only order once, not my favourite. They also serve ice cream made with liquid Nitrogen which they prepare by the table which adds a great twist and is entertaining to watch. I would definitely return to Dinner and I'd definitely recommend: the meat fruit, powdered duck and tipsy cake."	we had dinner here  the ambience and service were excellent  the waiter explained the menu in detail extensively and answered all questions we had  starters  the meat fruit  frumenty and earl grey tea cured salmon the meat fruit was definitely the star of this course  it was perfectly presented  the foies gras was smooth and luscious  the grilled octopus  the  frumenty  was fresh and tender but the general taste of the dish was nothing you would not be able to find in a good seafood tavern in a mediterranean country  that said  i ve found it difficult to find well cooked octopus in this country so they still deserve their five stars  the salmon was very fresh and mouthwatering main  powdered duck breast and chicken cooked with lettuces  i wasn t a fan of the chicken  however  the duck was divine  it was cooked to perfection  well seasoned and scrumptious  just perfect  desserts and tea  tipsy cake  brown bread ice cream  chocolate bar and sambocade  there was a great selection of teas  i d recommend the rose tea  the tipsy cake was absolutely gorgeous  you d have to pre order it as it takes 40 minutes to prepare  however it is one of the best desserts i have ever had  for an ice cream addict like myself  the brown bread ice cream was average  the chocolate bar and ginger ice cream were good but the bar was a bit too overpowering  the sambocade was different and worth trying but a dessert i would only order once  not my favourite  they also serve ice cream made with liquid nitrogen which they prepare by the table which adds a great twist and is entertaining to watch  i would definitely return to dinner and i d definitely recommend  the meat fruit  powdered duck and tipsy cake 
299	4.0	Maybe expectations make the experience. We went there for lunch and as such we didn't do the full monty. Might be one of the reasons for the slightly let down feeling I ended up with. Let it be said: the Meat fruit is fantastic. I order you to order this! But don't for a minute think that this tv-infused Heston-ish feel will go through the meal. Its not all disguised food and fun weird dishes, its not molecular gastronomy. It's reinvented british dishes - and well prepared no doubt about that. But I missed the WOW effect after the meat fruit. It's actually hard not to expect bells and whistles with all the Heston we've seen on tv, and with the meat fruit on the table. Yes the food is Michelin class, and the surroundings are worthy of a king. But the service is a bit stiff and I'm not sure they approve of kids (and mine are well behaved in restaurants!). So if I should go again it would be a 'no kids-all night' kind of thing!	maybe expectations make the experience  we went there for lunch and as such we didn t do the full monty  might be one of the reasons for the slightly let down feeling i ended up with  let it be said  the meat fruit is fantastic  i order you to order this  but don t for a minute think that this tv infused heston ish feel will go through the meal  its not all disguised food and fun weird dishes  its not molecular gastronomy  it s reinvented british dishes   and well prepared no doubt about that  but i missed the wow effect after the meat fruit  it s actually hard not to expect bells and whistles with all the heston we ve seen on tv  and with the meat fruit on the table  yes the food is michelin class  and the surroundings are worthy of a king  but the service is a bit stiff and i m not sure they approve of kids  and mine are well behaved in restaurants    so if i should go again it would be a  no kids all night  kind of thing

The experience began even before the food arrived - well presented menus and a very knowledgeable waiter who described the history of how the recipes were acquired, and modernised. We only knew of the meat fruit so ordered that - we were lucky to get a plum meat fruit instead of the usual mandarin orange.The main dishes were excellent, well presented and served timely. The tipsy cake was gorgeous, they will ask if you want it before your main arrives due to the time taken to cook it, make sure you say yes!!	we had lunch at dinner by heston  the experience began even before the food arrived   well presented menus and a very knowledgeable waiter who described the history of how the recipes were acquired  and modernised  we only knew of the meat fruit so ordered that   we were lucky to get a plum meat fruit instead of the usual mandarin orange the main dishes were excellent  well presented and served timely  the tipsy cake was gorgeous  they will ask if you want it before your main arrives due to the time taken to cook it  make sure you say yes

While we would have preferred to dine during dinnertime, we knew we couldn't miss it during our very brief 18 hours in London!This is for sure in my top 5 meals of all time.

303	4.0	"I was looking very much forward to my dining experience at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Many have touted several mainstay menu items as ""unique, must-haves"" so I had to check it out for myself.I would say the food and the overall experience were solid, but not mind-blowing. All the dishes were plated and constructed perfectly, but perhaps my tastebuds are tired of ""textbook"" meals and yearn for the x-factor. I'm not saying that I want all of my dishes to look haute cuisine or something straight out of a science-fiction movie. I just like the flavor profile of what I eat, especially when I'm doling out big bucks, to be a bit imaginative. This is where I would take corporate clients or a sexy date to. Especially if you're trying to impress with the brand. On the other hand, this is not the place I would take my most well-travelled, self-proclaimed foodie comrades. Some tips:Try: the meat-fruit - it looks pretty and the ""orange skin"" introduces a nice citrus taste to a smooth pate Try: the tipsy-cake dessert (must be ordered at the start of the meal)Try: the pork tenderloin if you're a meat-lover and are looking for a substantial dishResos: book well in advanceDress: business casual at the least"	i was looking very much forward to my dining experience at dinner by heston blumenthal  many have touted several mainstay menu items as  unique  must haves  so i had to check it out for myself i would say the food and the overall experience were solid  but not mind blowing  all the dishes were plated and constructed perfectly  but perhaps my tastebuds are tired of  textbook  meals and yearn for the x factor  i m not saying that i want all of my dishes to look haute cuisine or something straight out of a science fiction movie  i just like the flavor profile of what i eat  especially when i m doling out big bucks  to be a bit imaginative  this is where i would take corporate clients or a sexy date to  especially if you re trying to impress with the brand  on the other hand  this is not the place i would take my most well travelled  self proclaimed foodie comrades  some tips try  the meat fruit   it looks pretty and the  orange skin  introduces a nice citrus taste to a smooth pate try  the tipsy cake dessert  must be ordered at the start of the meal try  the pork tenderloin if you re a meat lover and are looking for a substantial dishresos  book well in advancedress  business casual at the least
304	5.0	"We came here for lunch with a party of 5 and basically were able to share most things on the menu.  They discouraged doing multiple appetizers (instead of the standard appetizer, main, dessert format), but in the end, we made it work out.They have a 3 course lunch menu for £40, but I don't think you get the proper experience with this, so we went a la carte.  On the menu, you can see the origins of each of the dishes (year, source), and it's crazy to me that a recipe from the 13th century can be so relevant to modern tastes. I like food history, so exploring the menu here was a lot of fun for me.Starters: 1. Meat fruit: chicken liver parfait in an orange exterior to make it look like a perfectly shaped tangerine. It's served on a beautiful dark wood board with grilled bread. The liver itself was rich and savory, and the grilling of the bread helped with texture2. Rice and flesh: saffron rice that's very yellow, nicely al dente, with calf tails, which had a good braised beef flavor3. Salagamundy: chicken oysters, salsify (love this), bone marrow, and a horseradish cream. This dish had a lot going on and was very unique 4. Savoury porridge: the frog legs are fried, and the porridge itself was the highlight for me - it's bright green, garlicky, slightly acidic, and very satisfying 5. Roast scallops: there were actually lots of greens on this dish, which I appreciated (roasted cucumber, broccolini), and the sauce was a cucumber ketchup Mains: 1. Roast Iberico pork chop: perfectly cooked (""to its natural color."" It was super tender but rich in flavor, and it came wth a ham hock and then chicharrones, which made it a very rounded out pork dish. The jus was so flavorful. 2. Chicken cooked with lettuces: it's probably one of the best chicken breasts I've had. It's been brined and then slow cooked so that it's ridiculously tender.  The skin is crisped outside and almost like it was de-fatted. The lettuces were ok, but the charred onion emulsion and chicken juices were very rich in flavor, and I soaked up every last bit of the sauceSides: 1. Fries: more like American fries2. Triple cooked chips: rectangles of fried goodness. These were so well seasoned and so crisp and battery outside but not dry at all inside. These are some of the best fries I've hadNote: the potatoes come with a house mushroom ketchup, which is pretty amazing (even though the chips were great on their own)Desserts:1. Tipsy cake: order this ahead. Think of a boozy brioche sort of bread pudding in a cast iron pot with spit roast pineapple on the side. It's enough for 2 people to share, but I wouldn't split it with more than that. If only all bread pudding tasted like this..2. Brown bread ice cream: the ice cream itself wasn't as strong as I expected, and the salted butter caramel kind of dominated. I thought this was just ok 3. Liquid nitrogen ice cream: we saw the cart go by and added this on. It's definitely a showy dish where they wheel the cart over and hand churn liquid nitrogen vanilla ice cream for you. The cone is super thin and light, and the ice cream is rolled in your choice of toppings (I had apple pop rocks, freeze dried raspberries, and chocolate bits).They finished us up with chocolate pudding and caraway biscuits. The biscuits are like shortbread, and the pudding is so smooth. The two go very well together.We were initially a bit put off by their discouragement of how we were trying to order, but all of the food was spot on in terms of execution and highlighting traditional / historic British food.  We had a very a nice, longer leisurely lunch overlooking Hyde Park on a nice fall day.  Reservations were made on Open Table.  Even though it's a good value, I'm so glad we did not get the 3 course set lunch."	we came here for lunch with a party of 5 and basically were able to share most things on the menu   they discouraged doing multiple appetizers  instead of the standard appetizer  main  dessert format   but in the end  we made it work out they have a 3 course lunch menu for  40  but i don t think you get the proper experience with this  so we went a la carte   on the menu  you can see the origins of each of the dishes  year  source   and it s crazy to me that a recipe from the 13th century can be so relevant to modern tastes  i like food history  so exploring the menu here was a lot of fun for me starters  1  meat fruit  chicken liver parfait in an orange exterior to make it look like a perfectly shaped tangerine  it s served on a beautiful dark wood board with grilled bread  the liver itself was rich and savory  and the grilling of the bread helped with texture2  rice and flesh  saffron rice that s very yellow  nicely al dente  with calf tails  which had a good braised beef flavor3  salagamundy  chicken oysters  salsify  love this   bone marrow  and a horseradish cream  this dish had a lot going on and was very unique 4  savoury porridge  the frog legs are fried  and the porridge itself was the highlight for me   it s bright green  garlicky  slightly acidic  and very satisfying 5  roast scallops  there were actually lots of greens on this dish  which i appreciated  roasted cucumber  broccolini   and the sauce was a cucumber ketchup mains  1  roast iberico pork chop  perfectly cooked   to its natural color   it was super tender but rich in flavor  and it came wth a ham hock and then chicharrones  which made it a very rounded out pork dish  the jus was so flavorful  2  chicken cooked with lettuces  it s probably one of the best chicken breasts i ve had  it s been brined and then slow cooked so that it s ridiculously tender   the skin is crisped outside and almost like it was de fatted  the lettuces were ok  but the charred onion emulsion and chicken juices were very rich in flavor  and i soaked up every last bit of the saucesides  1  fries  more like american fries2  triple cooked chips  rectangles of fried goodness  these were so well seasoned and so crisp and battery outside but not dry at all inside  these are some of the best fries i ve hadnote  the potatoes come with a house mushroom ketchup  which is pretty amazing  even though the chips were great on their own desserts 1  tipsy cake  order this ahead  think of a boozy brioche sort of bread pudding in a cast iron pot with spit roast pineapple on the side  it s enough for 2 people to share  but i wouldn t split it with more than that  if only all bread pudding tasted like this  2  brown bread ice cream  the ice cream itself wasn t as strong as i expected  and the salted butter caramel kind of dominated  i thought this was just ok 3  liquid nitrogen ice cream  we saw the cart go by and added this on  it s definitely a showy dish where they wheel the cart over and hand churn liquid nitrogen vanilla ice cream for you  the cone is super thin and light  and the ice cream is rolled in your choice of toppings  i had apple pop rocks  freeze dried raspberries  and chocolate bits  they finished us up with chocolate pudding and caraway biscuits  the biscuits are like shortbread  and the pudding is so smooth  the two go very well together we were initially a bit put off by their discouragement of how we were trying to order  but all of the food was spot on in terms of execution and highlighting traditional   historic british food   we had a very a nice  longer leisurely lunch overlooking hyde park on a nice fall day   reservations were made on open table   even though it s a good value  i m so glad we did not get the 3 course set lunch

They kept my fiance completely in the dark, seated us in the corner and brought over a congratulatory dessert after I popped the question.

306	4.0	Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the park. Although it was cloudy and rainy out, the large windows overlooking the park added just the right touch to the cozy ambiance. Service was warm and friendly.....and impeccable until  ice was poured all over me and the table. They were very apologetic and even offered us complimentary ice cream cones from the cart.Meat fruit = Amazing! This is a must try and ideally should be shared as it is quite rich and creamy. No question that it looks exactly like a mandarin orange. If only they made the leaves edible as well!The bone in rib was cooked just right. I was a bit concerned when they recommended medium but the meat was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.Tipsy Cake- I did not know what to expect with this dessert and I am not a huge fan of alcohol cakes. I was pleasantly surprised by the light flavors and pull-apart pillows of goodness. The pineapple was quite scrumptious as well.If you haven't had enough sweets, go for the ice cream cart which is off menu. We enjoy a good show so of course made-to-order liquid nitrogen ice cream is a delight to the eyes.Meat Fruit (c.1500)Mandarin, chicken liver & foie gras parfait, grilled breadBroth of Lamb (c.1730)Slow cooked hen's egg, celery, radish, turnip & veal sweetbreadsBone in Rib of Hereford Prime for 2 (c.1830)Mushroom ketchup & friesRunnnerbeans & shallotsTipsy Cake (c.1810)Spit roast pineappleBrown Bread Ice Cream (c.1830)Salted butter caramel, pear & malted yeast syrup	dinner by heston blumenthal is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the park  although it was cloudy and rainy out  the large windows overlooking the park added just the right touch to the cozy ambiance  service was warm and friendly     and impeccable until  ice was poured all over me and the table  they were very apologetic and even offered us complimentary ice cream cones from the cart meat fruit   amazing  this is a must try and ideally should be shared as it is quite rich and creamy  no question that it looks exactly like a mandarin orange  if only they made the leaves edible as well the bone in rib was cooked just right  i was a bit concerned when they recommended medium but the meat was perfectly cooked and well seasoned tipsy cake  i did not know what to expect with this dessert and i am not a huge fan of alcohol cakes  i was pleasantly surprised by the light flavors and pull apart pillows of goodness  the pineapple was quite scrumptious as well if you haven t had enough sweets  go for the ice cream cart which is off menu  we enjoy a good show so of course made to order liquid nitrogen ice cream is a delight to the eyes meat fruit  c 1500 mandarin  chicken liver   foie gras parfait  grilled breadbroth of lamb  c 1730 slow cooked hen s egg  celery  radish  turnip   veal sweetbreadsbone in rib of hereford prime for 2  c 1830 mushroom ketchup   friesrunnnerbeans   shallotstipsy cake  c 1810 spit roast pineapplebrown bread ice cream  c 1830 salted butter caramel  pear   malted yeast syrup
307	5.0	"It's been a few weeks since my lunch here but I am still quite speechless. The meal I had at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is high up there on my list of best dinning experiences.I was a bit nervous when I first arrived at the Mandarin Oriental, which completely exudes Knightsbridge pretension. But once I stepped into the actual restaurant, it was simply British elegance...an overly polite and warm staff, modern interior design, and great views of Hyde Park. I already knew it was going to be a great lunch, but the dishes delivered all the way. The restaurant's concept is to modernize historic/ancient British dishes taken from actual recipes that were found at British Museum and British Library archives. So every item on the menu had a real historical basis, and the wait staff provide a history lesson for each dish after you finish the course! There was a set lunch menu, but I opted to order a la carte. First course, seared scallops with ""cucumber ketchup"". This pretty much sets the standard for all scallop dishes. Deconstructed cucumber and the herb colored ketchup work well with the scallops. A distinct but surprisingly fitting coupling. Cod in Cider for main course. The cod was seared golden on the outside,  flaky and butter-like in texture. The cider sauce was thick, almost like a Bechamel sauce. The smoked artichoke hearts in the dish could have easily stood out as its own side dish. (And I am normally not an artichoke fan!) After the two heavy courses, I wasn't sure about a dessert as tempting as many of them were...so my waiter suggested the nitrogen ice cream made at the table side. We've had history lessons, and now there was a show too! I also had a lemongrass tea, a very appropriate British ending a most delightful meal. In lieu of a amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal, they offered a mini chocolate mousse with biscuit at the end of the meal. A young French sommelier recommended excellent wine parings for the starter and main course.  The whole waitstaff was keenly observant and they anticipated all my needs without being intrusive.Dinner at Heston Blumenthal offers the best of British dinning, and is every bit deserving of its two Michelin stars and title as 5th World's Best Restaurant. I look forward to dinning here again."	it s been a few weeks since my lunch here but i am still quite speechless  the meal i had at dinner by heston blumenthal is high up there on my list of best dinning experiences i was a bit nervous when i first arrived at the mandarin oriental  which completely exudes knightsbridge pretension  but once i stepped into the actual restaurant  it was simply british elegance   an overly polite and warm staff  modern interior design  and great views of hyde park  i already knew it was going to be a great lunch  but the dishes delivered all the way  the restaurant s concept is to modernize historic ancient british dishes taken from actual recipes that were found at british museum and british library archives  so every item on the menu had a real historical basis  and the wait staff provide a history lesson for each dish after you finish the course  there was a set lunch menu  but i opted to order a la carte  first course  seared scallops with  cucumber ketchup   this pretty much sets the standard for all scallop dishes  deconstructed cucumber and the herb colored ketchup work well with the scallops  a distinct but surprisingly fitting coupling  cod in cider for main course  the cod was seared golden on the outside   flaky and butter like in texture  the cider sauce was thick  almost like a bechamel sauce  the smoked artichoke hearts in the dish could have easily stood out as its own side dish   and i am normally not an artichoke fan   after the two heavy courses  i wasn t sure about a dessert as tempting as many of them were   so my waiter suggested the nitrogen ice cream made at the table side  we ve had history lessons  and now there was a show too  i also had a lemongrass tea  a very appropriate british ending a most delightful meal  in lieu of a amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal  they offered a mini chocolate mousse with biscuit at the end of the meal  a young french sommelier recommended excellent wine parings for the starter and main course   the whole waitstaff was keenly observant and they anticipated all my needs without being intrusive dinner at heston blumenthal offers the best of british dinning  and is every bit deserving of its two michelin stars and title as 5th world s best restaurant  i look forward to dinning here again 
308	4.0	Service/staff attitude was impersonal and cold, as was the environment (AC was on too high, so bring a light scarf), but the food was great. I don't remember the quirky names they had on the menu, but if I could dine here all over again, I'd definitely re-order: rose champagne, chicken/bone marrow appetizer, lobster in cucumber soup appetizer---OUTSTANDING. (Also good, though not amazing, were the mandarin chicken pate and oxtail risotto). Between the pork chop and the ribeye, definitely get the pork chop. It's prepared perfectly.  And comes with thrice cooked chips. Perhaps the most amazing fries I ever had in my life, I kid you not. Perfectly crispy on the outside and sooooo soft on the inside. And for dessert, definitely get the pineapple brioche---equally outstanding as the appetizers above. We were given complimentary strawberry sorbet and chocolate ganache, both very good too.	service staff attitude was impersonal and cold  as was the environment  ac was on too high  so bring a light scarf   but the food was great  i don t remember the quirky names they had on the menu  but if i could dine here all over again  i d definitely re order  rose champagne  chicken bone marrow appetizer  lobster in cucumber soup appetizer   outstanding   also good  though not amazing  were the mandarin chicken pate and oxtail risotto   between the pork chop and the ribeye  definitely get the pork chop  it s prepared perfectly   and comes with thrice cooked chips  perhaps the most amazing fries i ever had in my life  i kid you not  perfectly crispy on the outside and sooooo soft on the inside  and for dessert  definitely get the pineapple brioche   equally outstanding as the appetizers above  we were given complimentary strawberry sorbet and chocolate ganache  both very good too 
309	2.0	We just returned to the U.S. following ten days in Paris and London.  We are not strangers to Michelin starred restaurants.  While in Paris we had wonderful meals at Guy Savoy and Taillevent.  We expected the same at h.b.What a major disappointment.  To be most kind, our meal was the gastronomic equilivant to the emperors new clothes, short on food, long on pretense.  The service was at best perfunctory.  Our waiter tried to describe  the menu choices but English was not his strong suit and his delivery was like a teenager on speed.  We asked him to repeat things two or three times and even then we often gave up.  The food itself was just adequate and the portions were small.  The historical commentary regarding the menu options might have been interesting if they correlated to the food presented.  They did not.  My wife's order of duck was tepid, not even warm.  When we asked that it be heated, the waiters comment was something to the effect that we never serve it warm, let alone hot.  If we had wanted our food cold we would have gone out for sushi. Thanks for advising us earlier    Not once during our entire meals did Anyone come to our table to ask if we were enjoying our meal.  When the best food item was the bread, you know this restaurant is in big trouble.  We could go on but why?  If you don't get it by now, you never will.  The bottom line is this--if you want to get ripped off with marginal food and poor service, this is the place for you.	we just returned to the u s  following ten days in paris and london   we are not strangers to michelin starred restaurants   while in paris we had wonderful meals at guy savoy and taillevent   we expected the same at h b what a major disappointment   to be most kind  our meal was the gastronomic equilivant to the emperors new clothes  short on food  long on pretense   the service was at best perfunctory   our waiter tried to describe  the menu choices but english was not his strong suit and his delivery was like a teenager on speed   we asked him to repeat things two or three times and even then we often gave up   the food itself was just adequate and the portions were small   the historical commentary regarding the menu options might have been interesting if they correlated to the food presented   they did not   my wife s order of duck was tepid  not even warm   when we asked that it be heated  the waiters comment was something to the effect that we never serve it warm  let alone hot   if we had wanted our food cold we would have gone out for sushi  thanks for advising us earlier    not once during our entire meals did anyone come to our table to ask if we were enjoying our meal   when the best food item was the bread  you know this restaurant is in big trouble   we could go on but why   if you don t get it by now  you never will   the bottom line is this  if you want to get ripped off with marginal food and poor service  this is the place for you 
310	5.0	Highly recommend this place, for the combination of great food and reasonable prices, it's one of the best deals I've had for a 2-star Michelin restaurant. The atmosphere was one of the liveliest I've seen for a restaurant of this caliber. Bordering on rowdy. But it wasn't obnoxious at all, if anything it added to the fun. We ordered several dishes (sadly, I don't recall any of them that were mind-blowingly special, but I do remember all of them were amazing in taste and texture). The ice cream truck is a spectacle to behold, and I'd recommend getting some of the home-made ice cream from this truck, which they make right at your table. I also loved their selection of teas from around the world, including Fujian province, Iran, and various parts of Japan. If you're in London go. You won't regret it.	highly recommend this place  for the combination of great food and reasonable prices  it s one of the best deals i ve had for a 2 star michelin restaurant  the atmosphere was one of the liveliest i ve seen for a restaurant of this caliber  bordering on rowdy  but it wasn t obnoxious at all  if anything it added to the fun  we ordered several dishes  sadly  i don t recall any of them that were mind blowingly special  but i do remember all of them were amazing in taste and texture   the ice cream truck is a spectacle to behold  and i d recommend getting some of the home made ice cream from this truck  which they make right at your table  i also loved their selection of teas from around the world  including fujian province  iran  and various parts of japan  if you re in london go  you won t regret it

This is my 4th Michelin starred restaurant I've been to and so far it's definitely been my favourite. I can definitely say it was an eating experience rather than just a meal.I went for the Meat Fruit, which looks like a clementine with bread but is the most delicious pate. Highly recommend going for this as a starter. My main was the powdered duck, which was the most perfectly cooked duck I've ever eaten, and for my dessert I had the tipsy cake (which you have to order early on so that they can start preparing it, as it takes a while to cook) - my goodness this was possibly one of the most delicious desserts I've ever eaten. The brioche style of the cake was delicious and baked to perfection. As it was my birthday I decided to treat myself and also order the icecream which they make right in front of you. I definitely recommend going for this dessert too (you might as well splurge!) they make it right in front of you and pour the liquid nitrogen into the cream mixture so it's like a mini show. I cannot recommend this place enough. Yes you might have to save a bit before you go but if you're a foodie this is definitely one you have to try.	wow wow wow  i was simply blown away by my dinner experience here  service was so attentive  food was astounding  this is my 4th michelin starred restaurant i ve been to and so far it s definitely been my favourite  i can definitely say it was an eating experience rather than just a meal i went for the meat fruit  which looks like a clementine with bread but is the most delicious pate  highly recommend going for this as a starter  my main was the powdered duck  which was the most perfectly cooked duck i ve ever eaten  and for my dessert i had the tipsy cake  which you have to order early on so that they can start preparing it  as it takes a while to cook    my goodness this was possibly one of the most delicious desserts i ve ever eaten  the brioche style of the cake was delicious and baked to perfection  as it was my birthday i decided to treat myself and also order the icecream which they make right in front of you  i definitely recommend going for this dessert too  you might as well splurge   they make it right in front of you and pour the liquid nitrogen into the cream mixture so it s like a mini show  i cannot recommend this place enough  yes you might have to save a bit before you go but if you re a foodie this is definitely one you have to try

Meat fruit, chicken liver mousse wrapped in mandarin jelly, was excellent and fun. The duck breast with duck heart was perfect. The tipsy cake, a brioche cooked in sauterne with spit roasted pinnaple was delicious but rich. The porridge was fine but not as good as the rest.	beautiful lunch at this two star michelin ranked 7 in the world  every dish inspired by a historical british dish with references  meat fruit  chicken liver mousse wrapped in mandarin jelly  was excellent and fun  the duck breast with duck heart was perfect  the tipsy cake  a brioche cooked in sauterne with spit roasted pinnaple was delicious but rich  the porridge was fine but not as good as the rest 
314	5.0	I was traveling to London, I lived nearby so I reserved dinner for one night here. I was here alone but I felt being taken good care and not bored at all. I ordered the meat fruit. The balance between chicken liver and some clementine was great. When I finished my bread, more bread was given. The waiter and waitress were paying attention at me all the time. I had celery for the main. It had multiple layers of flavor. It has hardness in walnuts but also softness in celeries and the sauce. I definitely loved it. I ordered it because I wanted something light but I was super impressed by its flavor. For the dessert, I had the tipsy cake and it was an omg experience. It was a little too sweet for me, but I enjoyed the sweetness. The pineapple was roasted right on. After dinner I was shown around the kitchen. Everyone seemed busy and focused on their job!	i was traveling to london  i lived nearby so i reserved dinner for one night here  i was here alone but i felt being taken good care and not bored at all  i ordered the meat fruit  the balance between chicken liver and some clementine was great  when i finished my bread  more bread was given  the waiter and waitress were paying attention at me all the time  i had celery for the main  it had multiple layers of flavor  it has hardness in walnuts but also softness in celeries and the sauce  i definitely loved it  i ordered it because i wanted something light but i was super impressed by its flavor  for the dessert  i had the tipsy cake and it was an omg experience  it was a little too sweet for me  but i enjoyed the sweetness  the pineapple was roasted right on  after dinner i was shown around the kitchen  everyone seemed busy and focused on their job

316	5.0	I've always admired Heston Blumenthal from the countless YouTube videos I've seen of him taking a scientific (literally) approach to food. On my most recent trip to London I had the pleasure of dining at Dinner... except I came for lunch... Lunch @ Dinner (hah)!Decor: The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel which should be self explanatory in itself. For those of you who don't know the Mandarin Oriental, just think of the Ritz-Carlton, then take it up a notch. There were two things that really stood out about the interior of the restaurant: 1. The glass walls which surrounded the kitchen allowing you to take a glimpse inside, and 2. the modern see-through wine-cellar which stood at the entrance of the dining area. Service: Each table does not have its own server, rather there is a large amount of staff constantly attending the floor. This allows for both quicker ordering and a shorter-wait time between check-ups. The service at dinner was quite outstanding and the pleasant attitudes of the servers brightened up what was a very gloomy day outside.Food: Meat Fruit - The presentation of the meat fruit is both clever and beautiful. The meat fruit itself is very strong in flavor, but spread it on the nicely toasted bread and you have yourself a savory little starter. I would highly recommend this for everyone.Tipsy Cake - The second most popular item at Dinner behind the Meat Fruit. This triple-reduced pineapple cake is possibly the single sweetest/richest pastry I've ever encountered. Would highly recommend a nice glass of bitter espresso to go with this. If you are a sweet lover, this is a must!Roast Iberico Pork Chop - I don't remember much about this dish, but I do remember that I thought the vegetables were more amazing than the pork chop itself. Overall: Although not the most incredible meal of my life, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is all-deserving for the praise and accolades it has achieved. Great service, beautiful interior, and good food gives this place a certain 5/5.	i ve always admired heston blumenthal from the countless youtube videos i ve seen of him taking a scientific  literally  approach to food  on my most recent trip to london i had the pleasure of dining at dinner    except i came for lunch    lunch   dinner  hah  decor  the restaurant is located inside the mandarin oriental hotel which should be self explanatory in itself  for those of you who don t know the mandarin oriental  just think of the ritz carlton  then take it up a notch  there were two things that really stood out about the interior of the restaurant  1  the glass walls which surrounded the kitchen allowing you to take a glimpse inside  and 2  the modern see through wine cellar which stood at the entrance of the dining area  service  each table does not have its own server  rather there is a large amount of staff constantly attending the floor  this allows for both quicker ordering and a shorter wait time between check ups  the service at dinner was quite outstanding and the pleasant attitudes of the servers brightened up what was a very gloomy day outside food  meat fruit   the presentation of the meat fruit is both clever and beautiful  the meat fruit itself is very strong in flavor  but spread it on the nicely toasted bread and you have yourself a savory little starter  i would highly recommend this for everyone tipsy cake   the second most popular item at dinner behind the meat fruit  this triple reduced pineapple cake is possibly the single sweetest richest pastry i ve ever encountered  would highly recommend a nice glass of bitter espresso to go with this  if you are a sweet lover  this is a must roast iberico pork chop   i don t remember much about this dish  but i do remember that i thought the vegetables were more amazing than the pork chop itself  overall  although not the most incredible meal of my life  dinner by heston blumenthal is all deserving for the praise and accolades it has achieved  great service  beautiful interior  and good food gives this place a certain 5 5 
317	5.0	Easily one of my top 10 dining experiences! Let's talk:  1. MEAT FRUIT: friends, abandon any and all misgivings you have about liver or foie gras at the doors of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel!!! The Meat Fruit (chicken liver and foie gras parfait made to look like a mandarin orange) is a singular, most perfect dish I've ever seen or tasted in my life! The texture inside is so velvety and so decadent. SO DELICIOUS. I still dream about this dish. You MUST order this. Hell, order multiple. 2. TIPSY CAKE w/ spit-roasted pineapple: You have to order this dessert well in advanced. Why? Because perfection takes time! I don't normally love alcohol-infused desserts but this one takes the cake (ha I'm so punny...). The warm creamy brioche...oh so scrumptious. Forget calories. Order without reservations and then go jog in Hyde Park afterwards. Well worth it! Verdict: I'll come to Dinner for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner. Alas, I'm poor :(	easily one of my top 10 dining experiences  let s talk   1  meat fruit  friends  abandon any and all misgivings you have about liver or foie gras at the doors of the mandarin oriental hotel    the meat fruit  chicken liver and foie gras parfait made to look like a mandarin orange  is a singular  most perfect dish i ve ever seen or tasted in my life  the texture inside is so velvety and so decadent  so delicious  i still dream about this dish  you must order this  hell  order multiple  2  tipsy cake w  spit roasted pineapple  you have to order this dessert well in advanced  why  because perfection takes time  i don t normally love alcohol infused desserts but this one takes the cake  ha i m so punny      the warm creamy brioche   oh so scrumptious  forget calories  order without reservations and then go jog in hyde park afterwards  well worth it  verdict  i ll come to dinner for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  alas  i m poor   
318	1.0	I had high hopes eating here as this was ranked in the top 50 restaurants not only in London, but in the world.(theworlds50best.com)Pair that with 2 Michelins and I was prepared for one of the best meals I would ever have in my lifetime...well after eating here I feel like I've been ripped off and would like 3-4 hrs of my life returned please.Now before I complain I'll note that I'm not some value snob - prior to visiting Dinner by Heston, I visited The Ledbury and Hedone, both in London and ranked in the top 100 world restaurants.  So I am no foodie expert by any means but take this review with a grain of salt.  My 1 star review won't put a dent in their Michelin stars and reputation.Pretty much everything after the meat fruit dish fell flat.  The roast bone marrow was so promising from all the pics but was so under whelming.  The Earl Grey tea cured salmon was a very nice opening dish but the Roasted Iberico Pork Chop was served well done.  It was like a rock and almost inedible.  I should have said something but I think at this point we just wanted to get out.The restaurant is more like a full blown operation-  not very intimate setting - feels more like a business lunch setting and not quite what I was expecting for the #5 restaurant in the world.Pretty much by definition of a Michelin and this rating,I pretty much expect the food quality, taste, and service to be Damm near perfect.  For the money I d go back to The Ledbury for a more stiff, pretentious, but great food setting or Hedone for a more casual, romantic, fine dining setting.  Dinner by Heston failed on so many levels- I am trying to forget I ever came here.  It's a shame bc I really wanted to try Fat Duck at some point but I guess I won't now.	i had high hopes eating here as this was ranked in the top 50 restaurants not only in london  but in the world  theworlds50best com pair that with 2 michelins and i was prepared for one of the best meals i would ever have in my lifetime   well after eating here i feel like i ve been ripped off and would like 3 4 hrs of my life returned please now before i complain i ll note that i m not some value snob   prior to visiting dinner by heston  i visited the ledbury and hedone  both in london and ranked in the top 100 world restaurants   so i am no foodie expert by any means but take this review with a grain of salt   my 1 star review won t put a dent in their michelin stars and reputation pretty much everything after the meat fruit dish fell flat   the roast bone marrow was so promising from all the pics but was so under whelming   the earl grey tea cured salmon was a very nice opening dish but the roasted iberico pork chop was served well done   it was like a rock and almost inedible   i should have said something but i think at this point we just wanted to get out the restaurant is more like a full blown operation   not very intimate setting   feels more like a business lunch setting and not quite what i was expecting for the  5 restaurant in the world pretty much by definition of a michelin and this rating i pretty much expect the food quality  taste  and service to be damm near perfect   for the money i d go back to the ledbury for a more stiff  pretentious  but great food setting or hedone for a more casual  romantic  fine dining setting   dinner by heston failed on so many levels  i am trying to forget i ever came here   it s a shame bc i really wanted to try fat duck at some point but i guess i won t now 
319	5.0	Simply amazing. The service, the food, the experience, the handcrafted ice cream table side, totally worth every penny. Tried several dishes including the famous meat fruit which was mind blowing. Steak was perfectly cooked and the cocktails were fabulous along with the wine. Definitely get the tipsy cake as well. Ate at The Jules Verne in Paris 3 days later and can say this restaurant tops it in all categories except for service and the view.	simply amazing  the service  the food  the experience  the handcrafted ice cream table side  totally worth every penny  tried several dishes including the famous meat fruit which was mind blowing  steak was perfectly cooked and the cocktails were fabulous along with the wine  definitely get the tipsy cake as well  ate at the jules verne in paris 3 days later and can say this restaurant tops it in all categories except for service and the view 
320	5.0	Had the chance to return to Dinner by HB over the Christmas holidays, and once again, it was one of the top 3 dining experiences of my life (the other 2 being Tickets, in Barcelona, and Grace, in Chicago). I was excited to share the meal with 2 friends this time, allowing us to sample many more dishes than when I dined alone. Things I love about Dinner? An attentive, friendly and non-stuffy staff...their unique approach to food, updating old school recipes with a modern day twist...a casual atmosphere....plate-licking-good food (okay, you probably shouldn't really lick your plate)...and reasonable prices, at least when compared to American Michelin-Starred restaurants. If you are in London...I highly recommend that you treat yourself to a meal at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. You can thank me later.	had the chance to return to dinner by hb over the christmas holidays  and once again  it was one of the top 3 dining experiences of my life  the other 2 being tickets  in barcelona  and grace  in chicago   i was excited to share the meal with 2 friends this time  allowing us to sample many more dishes than when i dined alone  things i love about dinner  an attentive  friendly and non stuffy staff   their unique approach to food  updating old school recipes with a modern day twist   a casual atmosphere    plate licking good food  okay  you probably shouldn t really lick your plate    and reasonable prices  at least when compared to american michelin starred restaurants  if you are in london   i highly recommend that you treat yourself to a meal at dinner by heston blumenthal  you can thank me later

While some seemed exorbitant ($/glass), the flavors made it worth it.Service so pleasant and professional, it complemented the meal and added to the experience. Dishes were all impeccable and the flavors and textures surpassed imagination with the green porridge with frogs legs and the braised celery dishes to be the true mind blowers.Yes, it's pricey, but the attention to detail, creativity, ingredient quality, and service all made it worthwhile.

322	4.0	With the name comes high expectations, which can someone times be unfair. We had a late booking of 21:45 as that was the only time we can obtain on late notice, 2 weeks prior. We arrived well before our time slot, to sit at the bar and hope that another reservation may not arrive. Unfortunately we were unlucky but had a great time sampling the amazing, unique cocktails, one using chilli oils. The bar staff were great to start but soon dwindled and we were forgotten about, having to grab their attention on many occasions.We were then seated at the exact time slot. The waitress was great and they even remembered my conversation on the booking advising that one of us was a vegetarian and happily talked through the menu making suggestions to suit.The sommelier then arrived and he had to be the highlight of the night. He made us feel so relaxed, but also made us constantly laugh and smile. However, more importantly, he was extremely knowledgable and talked through different options we could try to match.Now the important bit, the food. The classically famous meat fruit. A lot bigger than I imagined with incredible flavour. I would say that there was at least one of these going to every table and would highly recommend trying it. The main was a ok but very forgettable.Overall the experience is something you wont't forgot anytime soon, but does it warrant the high prices. I don't think it does. Would I could back? Probably not, I believe it's a one time only 'special occasion' venue.

323	5.0	Loved the place. Not as good as the fat duck. But Heston has done his usual magic. The concept of recreating historical recipes is awesome. Wish the servers explained the historical context a bit more. Stick to the appetizers and the desserts and cocktails. In other words you can easily skip the mains.	loved the place  not as good as the fat duck  but heston has done his usual magic  the concept of recreating historical recipes is awesome  wish the servers explained the historical context a bit more  stick to the appetizers and the desserts and cocktails  in other words you can easily skip the mains

Yes, meat fruit and tipsy cake are definitely a must order. The octopus salad was a wonderful surprise. Cooked really well. I had the cod with cider. I loved the sauce which the waiter described as ""butter"" so I guess I like butter. We did get amazingly bored waiting for the main dishes. At about the same time we started ""napkin origami"" the food came, maybe 75 minutes after sitting down. Wife had chips with her rib eye. Rib eye was salty and nothing special. Chips were underwhelming. I would expect something creative but guess not.

325	5.0	"Amazing!Chef Ashley Palmer-Watts is a star. I was able to secure a reservation through UK's opentable and was excited to check it out on my trip over to Europe. The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental and it is conveniently located near the metro/tube/underground. If you take the Picadilly line to Knightsbridge you'll end up right there.The meat fruit is their signature dish and you must try it if you like foie gras. Not knowing what it was going to look like, I was totally surprised to see some crostini and a Mandarin orange on a wooden cutting board. (I wonder if they chose the mandarin orange because they are situated in the Mandarin Oriental... clever)At first I was like, where is the foie gras that was listed in the menu? Upon closer inspection, the orange ""rind"" is actually a gelatin like substance and the foie gras is inside! It was a pleasant surprise and was an amazing dish. My wife and I also shared the octopus which was good, but I think the Meat Fruit totally shined over it.For mains we got the duck and pigeon. The pigeon was suggested by one of the servers and I'm glad my wife got it. It's not something we would usually pick, but he was spot on. Juicy, delectable, tasty. Everything was cooked perfectly. For dessert we got the cheesecake and by suggestion of the servers, we also ordered the tipsy cake at the beginning of our meal. If you like monkey bread, you'll love tipsy cake. It was so good, I wish we got two so my wife and I could have our own. The restaurant is nice and you can see right into the kitchen, which is cool. It is expensive, but being from the United States, everything in London is expensive due to the strength of the GBP. I'd still go back regardless."	amazing chef ashley palmer watts is a star  i was able to secure a reservation through uk s opentable and was excited to check it out on my trip over to europe  the restaurant is located inside the mandarin oriental and it is conveniently located near the metro tube underground  if you take the picadilly line to knightsbridge you ll end up right there the meat fruit is their signature dish and you must try it if you like foie gras  not knowing what it was going to look like  i was totally surprised to see some crostini and a mandarin orange on a wooden cutting board   i wonder if they chose the mandarin orange because they are situated in the mandarin oriental    clever at first i was like  where is the foie gras that was listed in the menu  upon closer inspection  the orange  rind  is actually a gelatin like substance and the foie gras is inside  it was a pleasant surprise and was an amazing dish  my wife and i also shared the octopus which was good  but i think the meat fruit totally shined over it for mains we got the duck and pigeon  the pigeon was suggested by one of the servers and i m glad my wife got it  it s not something we would usually pick  but he was spot on  juicy  delectable  tasty  everything was cooked perfectly  for dessert we got the cheesecake and by suggestion of the servers  we also ordered the tipsy cake at the beginning of our meal  if you like monkey bread  you ll love tipsy cake  it was so good  i wish we got two so my wife and i could have our own  the restaurant is nice and you can see right into the kitchen  which is cool  it is expensive  but being from the united states  everything in london is expensive due to the strength of the gbp  i d still go back regardless 
326	5.0	In case you couldn't tell, the meat fruit is an essential dish to try here. (c.1500:  Mandarin, chicken liver & foie gras parfait with grilled bread, £17.50) It tastes and looks amazing. The smokiness of the grilled bread perfectly complements the almost sweet richness of the liver/foie gras and orange gel. Really great. I would be happy just coming here for this one dish and calling it a day. So great!We ended up spending so long at the Tate Modern before lunch that our friends, who were heading in the same direction, decided they'd try to join us. Despite the last-minute change, we asked if they could accommodate 4 instead of the original 2 for lunch and they graciously informed us that yes, luckily there was an open table. (Thankfully it wasn't a busy lunch.) Service was excellent, as was the food and cocktails. I'll definitely be back. Pricey, but worth it. I love being able to see into the kitchen and watch different dishes being prepped. Earl Grey Tea cured Salmon (c.1730: Lemon salad, gentleman's relish, wood sorrel & smoked roe for £16.00) was another great dish - the lemony tea smoke flavor and the salmon were perfect together. The historical aspect of this restaurant was what first drew me to it, and I'm glad it did.

327	5.0	"Late Night Dinner Date during our Eurotrip!Atmosphere: 4/5 The decor was lovely and being able to see into the kitchen from the main dining room was an additional plus! I love being able to see inside the kitchen, it's like having a show with your dinner! I recommend requesting to be seated at a table by the kitchen if you'd like this extra experience because there are several tables that can't see the kitchen. The atmosphere lost one star for me because I prefer fine dining restaurants to have dimmer lighting. The lighting was a bit bright for my liking which causes the noise levels to rise slightly, and gives the restaurant a more casual feeling than I expected. Service: 5/5 our server was charming, friendly, helpful, and very attentive! We took his recommendation on nearly every dish we ordered and we were happy that we did! The sommelier was knowledgable and helpful as well.  Food: 5/5 nothing bad to say here! We came in with high expectations and were not disappointed! For starters we ordered the Meat Fruit (which I saw other yelpers recommend) and it was phenomenal! The presentation was truly a piece of art. We also ordered the Salamagundy, which was quite good, but I preferred the Meat Fruit. For our main course we had the Bone in Rib of Hereford Prime cooked medium rare. The steak was delicious! It was cooked perfectly and had a great smokey flavor. The sauce served with it was a bit tangy, sweet, infused with some spices, but light and really brought out the flavor of the steak. Perfect pairing there! It also came with fries and a mushroom ketchup. The ketchup was very unique, but tastey! For dessert we ordered the Tipsy Cake and the Brown Bread Ice Cream. The Brown Bread Ice Cream was good and well presented, but the caramel was a little over powering for me. The Tipsy Cake was the best part of the entire meal for me (I'm a dessert person!) I would come to this restaurant again just for this dessert; it was that good! The ""cake"" was served hot in a small pot with a slice of pineapple on the side. At the bottom of the pot was where I found my little piece of heaven! A delectable vanilla, rum sauce soaking into the bottom of the cake! Wow!Overall: 5/5 all of my high expectations were met (minus the small detail of the lighting, which isn't too big of a deal for most).

328	1.0	"What a let down. Maybe it's my fault for being sucked into the whole ""celebrity chef"" thing. For the starter I had the smoked salmon. Yeah, it was nice. But so was the packet of smoked salmon I got from sainsburys the other day. After waiting about 30 mins (the wait staff did apologise) for the main of pork belly I was not impressed. It was not slow cooked. The skin was still fatty. I couldn't eat it. The wait staff did offer the fish dish but by this stage I was over it. Amazing service (although it took forever) but the food was a major let down. And for the price i'd never return."	what a let down  maybe it s my fault for being sucked into the whole  celebrity chef  thing  for the starter i had the smoked salmon  yeah  it was nice  but so was the packet of smoked salmon i got from sainsburys the other day  after waiting about 30 mins  the wait staff did apologise  for the main of pork belly i was not impressed  it was not slow cooked  the skin was still fatty  i couldn t eat it  the wait staff did offer the fish dish but by this stage i was over it  amazing service  although it took forever  but the food was a major let down  and for the price i d never return 
329	5.0	I had the pleasure of enjoying a lovely lunch at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal on September 15th.  My dining experience included the Lemon Salad, the famous Meat Fruit, Pork Belly, finished by the Bohemian Cake, with the added bonus of a silky chocolate treat served with a light caraway biscuit.  Every dish was beautifully plated and all the flavors complemented each other (as it is to be expected).  My lunch was enhanced even further when I was invited to take a detailed tour of the kitchen area by the Assistant Manager, who showed an impressive level of knowledge of each kitchen station.  As a part of my tour, I even had an opportunity to see how the Meat Fruit was made, which I thought was wonderful.  The velvety texture of the filling and tangerine jelly are delicious, but having the chance to learn more about the dish and seeing the required processes made everything more amazing.I was warmly welcomed when I walked in and the service was great.  I was absolutely thrilled with my lunch and can't wait to go back!	i had the pleasure of enjoying a lovely lunch at dinner by heston blumenthal on september 15th   my dining experience included the lemon salad  the famous meat fruit  pork belly  finished by the bohemian cake  with the added bonus of a silky chocolate treat served with a light caraway biscuit   every dish was beautifully plated and all the flavors complemented each other  as it is to be expected    my lunch was enhanced even further when i was invited to take a detailed tour of the kitchen area by the assistant manager  who showed an impressive level of knowledge of each kitchen station   as a part of my tour  i even had an opportunity to see how the meat fruit was made  which i thought was wonderful   the velvety texture of the filling and tangerine jelly are delicious  but having the chance to learn more about the dish and seeing the required processes made everything more amazing i was warmly welcomed when i walked in and the service was great   i was absolutely thrilled with my lunch and can t wait to go back

333	5.0	"This is not an orange.  It's FOIE GRAS.If that's not enough to pique your appetite, I don't know what will. I've never been one to jump up and down at the prospect of foie gras, but the very idea of stuffing a mandarin with the stuff is insanely creative and will titillate even the most stubborn tastebuds.Be warned it is ridiculously difficult to get a reservation. The only time they had available all month was 9:45pm on a Wednesday. We jumped on it and had no regrets.There seem to be two things you should always order here: the meat fruit (foie gras) appetizer and the tipsy cake. I abhor the ""wisdom"" of crowds sometimes, but in the case of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the crowd WINS. You should absolutely conform to popular opinion and get the foie gras and the tipsy cake. I'm a sweets person, so the tipsy cake was a freaking mindblower. It takes like creamy vanilla bread pudding, but infinitely better because of the pineapple side and the warm crispy, crunch, creaminess of it all...For my main I got the duck. I think I got lucky because it proved phenomenal. The side of blood was DELICIOUS... and I say this without cringing or the least bit of irony. It was a perfect complement to the duck, which was crispy on the outside and absolutely juicy and smoky delicious on the inside. Just make sure you cut against the grain (I'm one of those knife noobs who always forgets how to use the knife because I usually stick to veggies and hot carbs).  Speaking of carbs, not only did I order the tipsy cake, but I went all in and got a nitrogen ice cream as well.  They come around with a trolley to whip up the ice cream in front of you, spinning this machine that shoots fog out (see it to believe it). I'm not sure if I'm enamored with nitro ice cream like the rest of London, but it was quite an experience watching our server make the ice cream from scratch, explaining how it's done. The ice cream itself is only one flavor (vanilla), but you can choose 2/4 toppings (I went with the nuts). The thing about nitrogen ice cream is that it is SO cold but will melt fast, so you better lap it up quickly.All in all, the service was impeccable. Our servers were very friendly, engaging with us in conversation about where they were from and where we were from, German accents and such. Wonderful experience."	this is not an orange   it s foie gras if that s not enough to pique your appetite  i don t know what will  i ve never been one to jump up and down at the prospect of foie gras  but the very idea of stuffing a mandarin with the stuff is insanely creative and will titillate even the most stubborn tastebuds be warned it is ridiculously difficult to get a reservation  the only time they had available all month was 9 45pm on a wednesday  we jumped on it and had no regrets there seem to be two things you should always order here  the meat fruit  foie gras  appetizer and the tipsy cake  i abhor the  wisdom  of crowds sometimes  but in the case of dinner by heston blumenthal  the crowd wins  you should absolutely conform to popular opinion and get the foie gras and the tipsy cake  i m a sweets person  so the tipsy cake was a freaking mindblower  it takes like creamy vanilla bread pudding  but infinitely better because of the pineapple side and the warm crispy  crunch  creaminess of it all   for my main i got the duck  i think i got lucky because it proved phenomenal  the side of blood was delicious    and i say this without cringing or the least bit of irony  it was a perfect complement to the duck  which was crispy on the outside and absolutely juicy and smoky delicious on the inside  just make sure you cut against the grain  i m one of those knife noobs who always forgets how to use the knife because i usually stick to veggies and hot carbs    speaking of carbs  not only did i order the tipsy cake  but i went all in and got a nitrogen ice cream as well   they come around with a trolley to whip up the ice cream in front of you  spinning this machine that shoots fog out  see it to believe it   i m not sure if i m enamored with nitro ice cream like the rest of london  but it was quite an experience watching our server make the ice cream from scratch  explaining how it s done  the ice cream itself is only one flavor  vanilla   but you can choose 2 4 toppings  i went with the nuts   the thing about nitrogen ice cream is that it is so cold but will melt fast  so you better lap it up quickly all in all  the service was impeccable  our servers were very friendly  engaging with us in conversation about where they were from and where we were from  german accents and such  wonderful experience 
334	5.0	Amazing, nice view of the kitchen as well as Hyde Park . Went for lunch and ordered from the set menu which made things a little easier on the wallet. Ordered the pigs ear, quail, and millionaire shortbread as well as the nitrogen ice cream. All were amazing -- nitrogen ice cream was prepared and served table side which was quite the eye turner. Loved! And that quenelle -- super sexy !	amazing  nice view of the kitchen as well as hyde park   went for lunch and ordered from the set menu which made things a little easier on the wallet  ordered the pigs ear  quail  and millionaire shortbread as well as the nitrogen ice cream  all were amazing    nitrogen ice cream was prepared and served table side which was quite the eye turner  loved  and that quenelle    super sexy  
335	4.0	I came here for my birthday last year and I was impressed overall. The restaurant looks like it'll be a great place for business dinners, it's obvious they cater to the professional clientele. Service was great and attentive.The true standouts of the night were definitely the foie gras (Orange) dish, very tasty and definitely a surprise because of how well the foie paired with the citrus notes.  Their pineapple and cake aka tipsy cake dessert was also very good.If you're reading this and are from SF, then I would liken this place to Gary Danko, except with much better food.	i came here for my birthday last year and i was impressed overall  the restaurant looks like it ll be a great place for business dinners  it s obvious they cater to the professional clientele  service was great and attentive the true standouts of the night were definitely the foie gras  orange  dish  very tasty and definitely a surprise because of how well the foie paired with the citrus notes   their pineapple and cake aka tipsy cake dessert was also very good if you re reading this and are from sf  then i would liken this place to gary danko  except with much better food

The timing of taking our order and receiving our meals was perfect. Our waitress explained everything very well and had superb suggestions on what to order. All of the meals we ordered were perfect. We didn't know chicken and pork could taste so good. Each bite was an explosion of flavor in our mouths. We did not want to stop eating even though we were filled to the brim. This will definitely be our go to restaurant the next time we're in London.

339	5.0	Easily a five-star experience. The hotel and restaurant decor, atmosphere, and service are impeccable. We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked in. I felt cared for the entire time. We started with meat fruit. Creamy, tangy, and slightly sweet. Perfect for spreading on the grilled bread. When we finished half of our fruit and all of our bread, they offered to bring us a few more slices. For our main course we shared the powdered duck breast with smoked confit fennel and umbles. The meat was extremely tender and juicy. It almost melted with each bite. There was an additional piece of meat on our plate, which I afterward learned was duck heart. Oh my. Well, it did taste good. To finish we selected a dessert from the set lunch menu, Sambocade. It is a goats milk cheese cake with elderflower and fresh fig. Again, my main description is creamy, tangy, and slightly sweet. It had a light fruit filling, a dark coating (ash?), and several halved figs. We learned that this recipe is one of the oldest printed recipes in Britain, c.1390. We were tempted by the ice cream, made table-side with liquid nitrogen, but decided to pass. But that wasn't the end of our dining experience. Our waiter brought out two complementary shot glasses of dark chocolate mousse, infused with earl grey, and caraway biscuits. The flavors paired surprisingly well, as did the textures. This one will be hard to beat.	easily a five star experience  the hotel and restaurant decor  atmosphere  and service are impeccable  we were treated like royalty from the moment we walked in  i felt cared for the entire time  we started with meat fruit  creamy  tangy  and slightly sweet  perfect for spreading on the grilled bread  when we finished half of our fruit and all of our bread  they offered to bring us a few more slices  for our main course we shared the powdered duck breast with smoked confit fennel and umbles  the meat was extremely tender and juicy  it almost melted with each bite  there was an additional piece of meat on our plate  which i afterward learned was duck heart  oh my  well  it did taste good  to finish we selected a dessert from the set lunch menu  sambocade  it is a goats milk cheese cake with elderflower and fresh fig  again  my main description is creamy  tangy  and slightly sweet  it had a light fruit filling  a dark coating  ash    and several halved figs  we learned that this recipe is one of the oldest printed recipes in britain  c 1390  we were tempted by the ice cream  made table side with liquid nitrogen  but decided to pass  but that wasn t the end of our dining experience  our waiter brought out two complementary shot glasses of dark chocolate mousse  infused with earl grey  and caraway biscuits  the flavors paired surprisingly well  as did the textures  this one will be hard to beat

341	5.0	Meat fruit!I was traveling to London on a business trip and researching good restaurants to eat at. I was a bit hesitant to make the booking at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal because their 72 hour cancelation fee was 50 pounds per person. Yikes! However, I saw that the 6:30 pm reservation was the only one available for the next 1.5 months, so I knew I had to jump on it. My colleague and I showed up about 20 minutes early and were escorted to our table by the window. Since it was summer in London and the sun doesn't set until 9:30 pm, we had a nice view of Hyde Park for the entire meal. We ordered the meat fruit and octopus appetizers to share, and I ordered the duck entree and my colleague ordered the pork chop. All of the dishes had beautiful presentation and were perfectly executed. When the meat fruit came, I was so in awe at how much it looked like an orange that I wanted to poke it with my finger just to make sure it wasn't an orange. For dessert, we ordered the tipsy cake to share. They kept mentioning a spit-roasted pineapple so I expected a full pineapple (and there was a photo of a pineapple behind the reception area), but it was just a little slice. We also saw the ice cream trolley, but sadly I was too full to eat another dessert.I liked how their portions were reasonably sized so one person could easily consume both an appetizer and an entree. They also had great service and were very attentive without being too overbearing. Definitely coming back next time I'm in London!	meat fruit i was traveling to london on a business trip and researching good restaurants to eat at  i was a bit hesitant to make the booking at dinner by heston blumenthal because their 72 hour cancelation fee was 50 pounds per person  yikes  however  i saw that the 6 30 pm reservation was the only one available for the next 1 5 months  so i knew i had to jump on it  my colleague and i showed up about 20 minutes early and were escorted to our table by the window  since it was summer in london and the sun doesn t set until 9 30 pm  we had a nice view of hyde park for the entire meal  we ordered the meat fruit and octopus appetizers to share  and i ordered the duck entree and my colleague ordered the pork chop  all of the dishes had beautiful presentation and were perfectly executed  when the meat fruit came  i was so in awe at how much it looked like an orange that i wanted to poke it with my finger just to make sure it wasn t an orange  for dessert  we ordered the tipsy cake to share  they kept mentioning a spit roasted pineapple so i expected a full pineapple  and there was a photo of a pineapple behind the reception area   but it was just a little slice  we also saw the ice cream trolley  but sadly i was too full to eat another dessert i liked how their portions were reasonably sized so one person could easily consume both an appetizer and an entree  they also had great service and were very attentive without being too overbearing  definitely coming back next time i m in london 
342	5.0	We went to Dinner for lunch. (Clever). Having nothing to add to the previous comments,  lunch was sublime. The service was especially outstanding. We were fortunate to have the assistant manager take our order and explain the menu. We were even invited to see the kitchen first hand. One of the best meals we have had in London. Attention to detail was outstanding.	we went to dinner for lunch   clever   having nothing to add to the previous comments   lunch was sublime  the service was especially outstanding  we were fortunate to have the assistant manager take our order and explain the menu  we were even invited to see the kitchen first hand  one of the best meals we have had in london  attention to detail was outstanding 
343	5.0	This place is pretty awesome.  The space is gorgeous.  Not ostentatious but very elegant and modern with Hyde Park in the background.  I loved walking by the wine collection protected by glass.The meat fruit is really exceptional--what everyone raves about is true.  The pork chop was exceptional, the cod was lovely, and I loved my cucumber and lobster soup.  Great desserts (although we didn't do tipsy cake. Very good wines.  Just an elegant, refined, delicious Dinner.  Maybe not two Michellin stars--one is enough.	this place is pretty awesome   the space is gorgeous   not ostentatious but very elegant and modern with hyde park in the background   i loved walking by the wine collection protected by glass the meat fruit is really exceptional  what everyone raves about is true   the pork chop was exceptional  the cod was lovely  and i loved my cucumber and lobster soup   great desserts  although we didn t do tipsy cake  very good wines   just an elegant  refined  delicious dinner   maybe not two michellin stars  one is enough 
344	5.0	My boyfriend and I love fine cuisine, and we planned several fine dining meals while on our Europe trip. This was by far the best and most memorable meal we had. We found this place because we want to go somewhere that has a British favor to it (not just another French fine dining place). I got the meat fruit for appetizer, the angus steak for entree, a side of fries, and Sambocade for dessert. The meat fruit was hands down one of the most memorable dish I've ever had in my life. The Sambocade was amazing - I've never had goat cheese in my cheesecake before, and it blends so well. My boyfriend got the rice and flesh for appetizer (his favorite of the meal), cod in cider for entree, and the tipsy cake for dessert. We both loved everything we had. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here.

345	3.0	Believe me, I took great thought about this and it pains me to give this a 3 star, mostly because I was super excited to try this restaurant, heard about it, read about it and booked a reservation months ahead to try one of the world's best restaurants. Not that this was not good, but it was just that, an ok, a good, not extraordinary in anyway. Had I not had this high expectation of Heston, probably this review will go up to 4-star. Even during the dinner, I was trying to convince myself that this was astounding, but after several attempt, I stopped fooling myself and boldly face the reality. Tried the meat fruit, delicious and creamy, but it was just exactly that. Single dimensional taste, the texture was great but after couple of bites, you left feeling wanting to gulp 3 gallons of water just because it was so heavy. But don't get me wrong, it was delicious.  For entree, tried the duck breast. Ironically, that same morning I tried duck and waffle and I can't stop my head from comparing this duck to that delicious fried duck. As alluded, after several mind battle to convince myself this was better, I succumbed and admitted that freaking 15pound duck at Duck & Waffle was superior.Tried the tipsy cake too, it was nice and more on the overly sweet side. Also, it was unfortunate that there was only one amuse bouche, maybe I was spoiled, but wasn't it supposed to be more than 1, at least a couple of single-bite dish on one plate or whatever? It was a let down too. Nevertheless, one high point was the service. Very attentive, professional, charming and dedicated. I just wish the food was as good as the service *loud sigh*	believe me  i took great thought about this and it pains me to give this a 3 star  mostly because i was super excited to try this restaurant  heard about it  read about it and booked a reservation months ahead to try one of the world s best restaurants  not that this was not good  but it was just that  an ok  a good  not extraordinary in anyway  had i not had this high expectation of heston  probably this review will go up to 4 star  even during the dinner  i was trying to convince myself that this was astounding  but after several attempt  i stopped fooling myself and boldly face the reality  tried the meat fruit  delicious and creamy  but it was just exactly that  single dimensional taste  the texture was great but after couple of bites  you left feeling wanting to gulp 3 gallons of water just because it was so heavy  but don t get me wrong  it was delicious   for entree  tried the duck breast  ironically  that same morning i tried duck and waffle and i can t stop my head from comparing this duck to that delicious fried duck  as alluded  after several mind battle to convince myself this was better  i succumbed and admitted that freaking 15pound duck at duck   waffle was superior tried the tipsy cake too  it was nice and more on the overly sweet side  also  it was unfortunate that there was only one amuse bouche  maybe i was spoiled  but wasn t it supposed to be more than 1  at least a couple of single bite dish on one plate or whatever  it was a let down too  nevertheless  one high point was the service  very attentive  professional  charming and dedicated  i just wish the food was as good as the service  loud sigh 
346	5.0	Having been to a number of Michelin restaurants I have to say that Heston's is one of my favourite, especially for its value for money. Yes it's pricey but its in a great setting, the staff are really attentive and the food is simply great.

347	5.0	I came here with a couple of friends for the £38 set lunch menu, but I mistakenly booked lunch for a sunday when the menu wasn't available. As the booking service charges £50 for a missed reservation, we just decided to go here for the normal menu anyway. We walked into the hotel and were greeted immediately by the hostess who knew our reservation by name. She walked us to our table, and our server came soon after to give us our menus. Though I was hesitant to get the braised celery dish, the outstanding yelp reviews convinced me to get it anyway. I also got the tipsy cake and a side of chips thanks to other reviewers. Note: the tipsy cake needs to be ordered with the main course as it takes a long time to make!While we waited for our food, we got two types of bread (white, brown) with plenty of butter. They also brought out more bread as we kept finishing all the bread in front of us. When the food came out I was a bit taken aback by how pretty the dish was! It was absolutely stunning. I was also not disappointed at all by the lack of meat in the dish. The braised celery was much more filling, tasty, and savory than I expected it to be. Shortly after we finished eating, our desserts came out together and they were also really beautiful. The tipsy cake is an absolute MUST when dining at Dinner. The cake was delightfully soft and the sauce sweet but not overpowering. The pineapple on the side was also a good balance for the cake. Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great service and food. It's no wonder it has 2 michelin stars and the ranking of #5 best restaurant in the world - absolutely well deserved!	i came here with a couple of friends for the  38 set lunch menu  but i mistakenly booked lunch for a sunday when the menu wasn t available  as the booking service charges  50 for a missed reservation  we just decided to go here for the normal menu anyway  we walked into the hotel and were greeted immediately by the hostess who knew our reservation by name  she walked us to our table  and our server came soon after to give us our menus  though i was hesitant to get the braised celery dish  the outstanding yelp reviews convinced me to get it anyway  i also got the tipsy cake and a side of chips thanks to other reviewers  note  the tipsy cake needs to be ordered with the main course as it takes a long time to make while we waited for our food  we got two types of bread  white  brown  with plenty of butter  they also brought out more bread as we kept finishing all the bread in front of us  when the food came out i was a bit taken aback by how pretty the dish was  it was absolutely stunning  i was also not disappointed at all by the lack of meat in the dish  the braised celery was much more filling  tasty  and savory than i expected it to be  shortly after we finished eating  our desserts came out together and they were also really beautiful  the tipsy cake is an absolute must when dining at dinner  the cake was delightfully soft and the sauce sweet but not overpowering  the pineapple on the side was also a good balance for the cake  overall  a wonderful dining experience with great service and food  it s no wonder it has 2 michelin stars and the ranking of  5 best restaurant in the world   absolutely well deserved 
348	5.0	Been to Dinner twice for dinner.  Both times were excellent.  All the servers were excellent and knowledgeable.  If you have not been before, you have to get the meat fruit and the pineapple tipsy cake.  The nitrogen ice cream has an okay novelty factor, but I'd seen it before in other places.  The second time I went, two of my dining companions split the ribeye steak for two, which I really enjoyed.  The steak had a really nice woody char flavor from the fire.  The sourdough bread they start you off is as amazing as I remembered from The Fat Duck.	been to dinner twice for dinner   both times were excellent   all the servers were excellent and knowledgeable   if you have not been before  you have to get the meat fruit and the pineapple tipsy cake   the nitrogen ice cream has an okay novelty factor  but i d seen it before in other places   the second time i went  two of my dining companions split the ribeye steak for two  which i really enjoyed   the steak had a really nice woody char flavor from the fire   the sourdough bread they start you off is as amazing as i remembered from the fat duck 
349	4.0	This is a pretty special place, definitely worth the star from the tyre company, and because I am Australian, the prices for this level of dining are very reasonable. So, you should get online and make a booking.The standout was not necessarily the food, which was pretty good, but the service. They seemed to find the perfect balance between attentiveness and privacy. The setting is also very nice - a view over Hyde Park in Summer can't be beaten. The food was pretty good, but I was disappointed that I missed out on Heston's triple cooked chips - I understand it was something to do with the non-availability of a certain potato - but everything else was very good (and to go back to my original point, better than expected because the prices, in Australian terms, were so reasonable). The highlight, food wise, was the Meat-Fruit. Wow. So clever. And so many levels of taste. The other highlight was the Brown Bread Ice-Cream, which worked spectacularly. It tasted like... home. Back when I was 7 years old, and mum would make comforting desserts for the whole family.	this is a pretty special place  definitely worth the star from the tyre company  and because i am australian  the prices for this level of dining are very reasonable  so  you should get online and make a booking the standout was not necessarily the food  which was pretty good  but the service  they seemed to find the perfect balance between attentiveness and privacy  the setting is also very nice   a view over hyde park in summer can t be beaten  the food was pretty good  but i was disappointed that i missed out on heston s triple cooked chips   i understand it was something to do with the non availability of a certain potato   but everything else was very good  and to go back to my original point  better than expected because the prices  in australian terms  were so reasonable   the highlight  food wise  was the meat fruit  wow  so clever  and so many levels of taste  the other highlight was the brown bread ice cream  which worked spectacularly  it tasted like    home  back when i was 7 years old  and mum would make comforting desserts for the whole family

I requested a table next to the windows so I could gaze at Hyde Park.In a completely empty restaurant I was seated several tables over from the window. When I mentioned this to staff they informed me others had reserved every table near the window and we couldn't be moved.45 minutes went by with nobody sitting there---I asked again and was moved.Thanks for the awkward table change mid meal.The food was meh. I ordered the cod in cider. The cod was tender yet flavorless. It desperately needed that cider. It was also so tender that it had me slightly worried that it may not be cooked all the way through.My guest ordered the braised celery which was good but a very small portion compared to the cod.Yes, I ordered the meat fruit. No- I wasn't amazed by it.The bread was too hard.The pineapple tipsy cake was the stand out item on the menu if you must know.It's a damn shame I couldn't just order than upon walking in....who's to say you can't though?Maybe there will be a second time.	i regret giving this a 3 star rating but i didn t have the experience i d read about via yelp or pretty much anywhere else on the internet i made a reservation months in advance   like one must for dinner   i made a noon booking on a wednesday  i requested a table next to the windows so i could gaze at hyde park in a completely empty restaurant i was seated several tables over from the window  when i mentioned this to staff they informed me others had reserved every table near the window and we couldn t be moved 45 minutes went by with nobody sitting there   i asked again and was moved thanks for the awkward table change mid meal the food was meh  i ordered the cod in cider  the cod was tender yet flavorless  it desperately needed that cider  it was also so tender that it had me slightly worried that it may not be cooked all the way through my guest ordered the braised celery which was good but a very small portion compared to the cod yes  i ordered the meat fruit  no  i wasn t amazed by it the bread was too hard the pineapple tipsy cake was the stand out item on the menu if you must know it s a damn shame i couldn t just order than upon walking in    who s to say you can t though maybe there will be a second time 
351	5.0	Requires a booking in advance for sure, it's that popular. This is a fantastic restaurant and essentially every dish on the menu is pitch perfect. Definitely go for the Meat Fruit, which is a pate disguised as a Mandarin orange, it's rich and rife for instagram opportunities. Every single main is amazing, I cannot stress this enough (or at least those that I tried). Your meal should end off with their Tipsy Cake for dessert (and you MUST have their dessert), which is a pineapple on spit roast with some cake thrown in and a marvelous innovation by Chef Heston.

 But bready and cool and creamy all at once.  I'm not just copping out by using the word ""interesting"" here; it truly was the type of dessert that confused my palate with bitter and sweet and salty and further perplexed it with soft and creamy and crunchy textures.  I'd recommend it, especially if you're even remotely a caramel fan.The meals ended with coffees (americano, cappuccino, flat white) which was strong and hot.  Gratis were some tiny Earl Grey-infused ganaches with a side of carraway shortbread.  Yelp note: the menu changes very slowly here; some seasonal desserts and a few seafood details changed from when my friends went in the winter.  Being a bit of a food history dork I especially appreciated the detail and dates accompanying the different items and the news that Blumenthal had consulted with cookery experts, and the British Library to make sure he replicated elements authentically.  In the words of Ali G: respec."	parents are in town   we re gon  be eatin  right   off to dinner   for  erm   lunch there s a lot of great yelping out there already for dinner  so i ll try to be brief   thankfully i m no dissenting voice  so i ll join the chorus  the service is great   super attentive but not stuffy or pretentious  and magically able to suss out just when we were ready enough to be decisive with our menu picks or getting prepped to pay our bill   this service extended beyond the table to greeters and the kindly woman running coat check   great staff goes a long  long way also  a quick note on the calm venue  looking out over greenery and people exercising in hyde park is the perfect place to spend a gluttonous afternoon indoors   heh   so   on to the food anything i ve ever read about dinner basically  insisted  that i order meat fruit as a starter   i did   it was   perfect    truly the best bite of the day   perfectly silky chicken liver and foie in the adorably realistic guise of a mandarin orange   three crunchy grilled pieces of bread were the perfect vessel for nom ing   we had the last lunch table of the day  so i was thankfully able to base my choice of main on what i spied on the tables around me   my pops and i split the bone in hereford prime rib for 2  with mushroom kechup and thrice done chips  and then we decided to go for carby broke with a side of  erm   mashed potato   and buttery carraway scented carrots   don t judge  we were hungry folk   i feel as though this next line might top the limits of pretentious food speak  but i mmagon  risk it  it was an umami fest   like perfect savoury bites with the reduced wine sauce and the mushroom ketchup and the aged beef cooked to a delicious medium rare that treated the marbling perfectly my mum let me stick my fork in some of the spelt ham hock mixture topped with pork crackling that accompanied her black foot pork chop  perfectly cooked    otherwise she was super possessive of her plate  a sign of a meal truly enjoyed dessert was two dishes split by three family members with impressive spoon skills  towards the last bites it got nasty    the bohemian cake was a biscuit base with a citrusy perfume and a deeply chocolate y mousse   i d never had yuzu and chocolate together  and it was a success  especially when paired with the sweet floral honeyed icecream   the brown bread icecream was a winner for me   because it was weird   like  malty and salty and kindof like beer   but bready and cool and creamy all at once   i m not just copping out by using the word  interesting  here  it truly was the type of dessert that confused my palate with bitter and sweet and salty and further perplexed it with soft and creamy and crunchy textures   i d recommend it  especially if you re even remotely a caramel fan the meals ended with coffees  americano  cappuccino  flat white  which was strong and hot   gratis were some tiny earl grey infused ganaches with a side of carraway shortbread   yelp note  the menu changes very slowly here  some seasonal desserts and a few seafood details changed from when my friends went in the winter   being a bit of a food history dork i especially appreciated the detail and dates accompanying the different items and the news that blumenthal had consulted with cookery experts  and the british library to make sure he replicated elements authentically   in the words of ali g  respec

The whole restaurant is based on historical dishes and they don't disappoint. Others in my party had the pork and the chicken, which were delicious. The service is also top notch. Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.	if five stars are as good as it gets  it can be better  what an amazing restaurant  the meat fruits were amazing  as was the cod  the whole restaurant is based on historical dishes and they don t disappoint  others in my party had the pork and the chicken  which were delicious  the service is also top notch  overall  one of the best dining experiences i ve ever had 
355	4.0	Nice location, overlooking Hyde Park (in the Mandarin Oriental hotel).  Very good service and extremely knowledgeable staff.  Food is excellent.  Good flavors, well prepared food and artistically plated.  In the current menu, my favorite starter is Frumenty (octopus), and the favorite main is the filet of Aberdeen Angus.  Dessert is a modest disappointment.  However, the Tipsy cake is a good, simple finish to a very good meal.	nice location  overlooking hyde park  in the mandarin oriental hotel    very good service and extremely knowledgeable staff   food is excellent   good flavors  well prepared food and artistically plated   in the current menu  my favorite starter is frumenty  octopus   and the favorite main is the filet of aberdeen angus   dessert is a modest disappointment   however  the tipsy cake is a good  simple finish to a very good meal 
356	4.0	Inside the beautifully historic building of the Mandarin Oriental is the restaurant Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. The restaurant is very modern which makes it quite the anti thesis to the hotel it is located in. Mandarin Oriental's facade is so grand and you are really reminded that you are in London while entering the timeless building. Once you enter the restaurant, timelessness gives way to modernity. The pretty large kitchen is separated by ceiling-to-floor glass walls and offers a view of what goes on inside. The wall of the wine cellar is also made of glass from ceiling to floor.Everyone who comes here must try the signature meat fruit which is foie gras and chicken liver encased in mandarin jelly. When presented at the table, it looks like a mandarin fruit. Slice it into half and you will see the foie gras and chicken liver inside. We ordered the meat fruit ala carte as a supplement to our prix fixe lunch. The £39 3-course lunch was quite a deal given that it's a one Michelin star restaurant by Heston. The entree of dressed snails were good but having a little less dressing would allow the flavor of the snails to stand out more. My main course was the roasted quail which I enjoyed very much. The meat was absolutely tender and probably one of the most tender quails I've had. My sister and I each ordered the same entree and main choices but for dessert, we ordered one of each from the two given choices. We enjoyed the desserts, very much so. The olive oil shortbread and chocolate ganache were chocolatey enough without being too intense. The grapefruit/peach tart was a refreshing end to the meal.Solid meal, yes, but not phenomenal and by all means not mind blowing (I imagine everything of Heston to be close to mind blowing..hah!). The prix fixe lunch is a great value and if you consider the price, its one Michelin star rating, and the fact that it is a Heston Blumenthal restaurant, a visit to this place is a pretty good deal. Note that Heston is not the executive chef at this restaurant though. He is at his three Michelin star restaurant, The Fat Duck. Will I return? Probably yes, to try their ala carte menu. But I can't promise that I won't visit other Michelin rated restaurants in London before making a return visit to this place on my next trip to London.Note: My sister has been to Dinner several times over the past 4 years and according to her, the prix fixe lunch menu hasn't changed all that much.	inside the beautifully historic building of the mandarin oriental is the restaurant dinner by heston blumenthal  the restaurant is very modern which makes it quite the anti thesis to the hotel it is located in  mandarin oriental s facade is so grand and you are really reminded that you are in london while entering the timeless building  once you enter the restaurant  timelessness gives way to modernity  the pretty large kitchen is separated by ceiling to floor glass walls and offers a view of what goes on inside  the wall of the wine cellar is also made of glass from ceiling to floor everyone who comes here must try the signature meat fruit which is foie gras and chicken liver encased in mandarin jelly  when presented at the table  it looks like a mandarin fruit  slice it into half and you will see the foie gras and chicken liver inside  we ordered the meat fruit ala carte as a supplement to our prix fixe lunch  the  39 3 course lunch was quite a deal given that it s a one michelin star restaurant by heston  the entree of dressed snails were good but having a little less dressing would allow the flavor of the snails to stand out more  my main course was the roasted quail which i enjoyed very much  the meat was absolutely tender and probably one of the most tender quails i ve had  my sister and i each ordered the same entree and main choices but for dessert  we ordered one of each from the two given choices  we enjoyed the desserts  very much so  the olive oil shortbread and chocolate ganache were chocolatey enough without being too intense  the grapefruit peach tart was a refreshing end to the meal solid meal  yes  but not phenomenal and by all means not mind blowing  i imagine everything of heston to be close to mind blowing  hah    the prix fixe lunch is a great value and if you consider the price  its one michelin star rating  and the fact that it is a heston blumenthal restaurant  a visit to this place is a pretty good deal  note that heston is not the executive chef at this restaurant though  he is at his three michelin star restaurant  the fat duck  will i return  probably yes  to try their ala carte menu  but i can t promise that i won t visit other michelin rated restaurants in london before making a return visit to this place on my next trip to london note  my sister has been to dinner several times over the past 4 years and according to her  the prix fixe lunch menu hasn t changed all that much 
357	4.0	A spectacular restaurant. The grand dining room is arranged in homage to the bustling kitchen lined with glass so that everybody can watch 'where the magic happens'. The centrepiece of the kitchen is the large grill where the pineapples for the 'Tipsy Cake' dessert are being roasted. Incidentally the Tipsy Cake dessert is an absolute must. The waiting staff were helpful and able to suggest a number of vegetarian versions of dishes that weren't necessarily on the menu. The food was dynamic and intriguing and packed full of interesting flavour combinations. The wine list was extensive. The whole meal was topped off with ice cream that is made by your table using typical Heston Blumenthal theatrics and liquid nitrogen.

361	5.0	If you eat only one meal in your life it should probably be at one of Heston's restaurants.  Words cannot describe the experience you will have here.  When I dined there the menu included old recipes- 1300's to 1700's old- featuring modernist execution.  An amazing idea with amazing results.  You may have to mortgage the house to eat here but the spectacle of fresh ice cream made with liquid nitrogen at the table makes it all worth while.	if you eat only one meal in your life it should probably be at one of heston s restaurants   words cannot describe the experience you will have here   when i dined there the menu included old recipes  1300 s to 1700 s old  featuring modernist execution   an amazing idea with amazing results   you may have to mortgage the house to eat here but the spectacle of fresh ice cream made with liquid nitrogen at the table makes it all worth while

For example I would recommend you order a starter of meat fruit and the tipsy cake for dessert.Touch expensive too.	this is a very good restaurant  have been here twice  would have given a 5 on the first visit however there are some misses if you stray from the classics  for example i would recommend you order a starter of meat fruit and the tipsy cake for dessert touch expensive too 
363	5.0	This has to be the best meal I've had in the past year. Everything was excellent. I was fortunate to be with a good sized group so we got to try each other's dishes. Each one tasted amazing. I think by far my favorite was the the Powdered Duck Breast. It was so flavorful and tender. Make sure to save room for dessert because the Tipsy Cake is worth it. Along with their home made ice cream prepared at your table. The next time I'm in London, I will be going back here.	this has to be the best meal i ve had in the past year  everything was excellent  i was fortunate to be with a good sized group so we got to try each other s dishes  each one tasted amazing  i think by far my favorite was the the powdered duck breast  it was so flavorful and tender  make sure to save room for dessert because the tipsy cake is worth it  along with their home made ice cream prepared at your table  the next time i m in london  i will be going back here

365	5.0	We had friends who recommended this restaurant to us, so my wife and I booked it as our classy dinner for our week in London. The staff was professional from the start. While there were lots of staff, everyone seemed to stay busy but relaxed, working well together. The room is well-lit with large windows that look out on Hyde park. We had noon reservations and were seated immediately. We both did the set lunch menu, which has 2 options for each course. I ordered the first option of each course and my wife ordered the second options, which meant that we could share and each try both. All our dishes were interesting and well executed. A memorable point was the octopus in our salad; it was very tender and appeared to be thin cross sections of bundles of octopus. The quail and pollock were flavorful.I felt that the set lunch menu and experience was a good value for the price.	we had friends who recommended this restaurant to us  so my wife and i booked it as our classy dinner for our week in london  the staff was professional from the start  while there were lots of staff  everyone seemed to stay busy but relaxed  working well together  the room is well lit with large windows that look out on hyde park  we had noon reservations and were seated immediately  we both did the set lunch menu  which has 2 options for each course  i ordered the first option of each course and my wife ordered the second options  which meant that we could share and each try both  all our dishes were interesting and well executed  a memorable point was the octopus in our salad  it was very tender and appeared to be thin cross sections of bundles of octopus  the quail and pollock were flavorful i felt that the set lunch menu and experience was a good value for the price 
366	5.0	"I still reminisce over the ""Meat Fruit"" and Tipsy Cake that I had at Dinner. Heavenly.The dining room felt a bit stiff (probably attributable to the well-suited and glamourous diners) in my opinion but beautifully decorated indeed. I haven't had the fortune of making it to Fat Duck yet, so as Heston Blumenthal's first/only London restaurant, I was mega-excited to finally try his food. Still difficult to get a reservation a year after opening, but the hype is definitely justified.Meat Fruit needs no introduction - if you're not familiar with it, it's chicken liver paté masked as a mandarin orange with chargrilled bread on the side. The taste was incredibly rich and livery (don't order it if you hate the taste of livers because it's VERY prominent). The paté was so smooth and unlike anything I've had - definitely needs to be eaten with bread to cut the richness.I went for cured salmon with beetroot purée as my main because I knew I'd be stuffed from starters. It sounds like a simple dish, but when salmon is cooked right, it's insanely good. (For the record, Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley has a fantastic cured salmon starter too!) The sweetness of the beetroot purée went perfectly with the slightly smoky/salty salmon. When it came time to order desserts, Tipsy Cake was a no-brainer for me. Come on, booze + brioche bun + cream? Not to mention the SPIT-ROAST PINEAPPLE that the waiter kept pointing towards throughout the meal, and telling us how good it is? Winning combination for me! The dessert is definitely boozy, but in a good way, and not overpowering. Indulgence at its best, and when you have it with the caramelised pineapple...truly heavenly. You also get a earl grey mousse with shortbread as a finish to the meal, but I found it too much after the Tipsy Cake. Nevertheless, well-deserved 5-stars from me. I need to get my hands on the Tipsy Cake recipe to fill the void in my life!"	i still reminisce over the  meat fruit  and tipsy cake that i had at dinner  heavenly the dining room felt a bit stiff  probably attributable to the well suited and glamourous diners  in my opinion but beautifully decorated indeed  i haven t had the fortune of making it to fat duck yet  so as heston blumenthal s first only london restaurant  i was mega excited to finally try his food  still difficult to get a reservation a year after opening  but the hype is definitely justified meat fruit needs no introduction   if you re not familiar with it  it s chicken liver pat  masked as a mandarin orange with chargrilled bread on the side  the taste was incredibly rich and livery  don t order it if you hate the taste of livers because it s very prominent   the pat  was so smooth and unlike anything i ve had   definitely needs to be eaten with bread to cut the richness i went for cured salmon with beetroot pur e as my main because i knew i d be stuffed from starters  it sounds like a simple dish  but when salmon is cooked right  it s insanely good   for the record  marcus wareing at the berkeley has a fantastic cured salmon starter too   the sweetness of the beetroot pur e went perfectly with the slightly smoky salty salmon  when it came time to order desserts  tipsy cake was a no brainer for me  come on  booze   brioche bun   cream  not to mention the spit roast pineapple that the waiter kept pointing towards throughout the meal  and telling us how good it is  winning combination for me  the dessert is definitely boozy  but in a good way  and not overpowering  indulgence at its best  and when you have it with the caramelised pineapple   truly heavenly  you also get a earl grey mousse with shortbread as a finish to the meal  but i found it too much after the tipsy cake  nevertheless  well deserved 5 stars from me  i need to get my hands on the tipsy cake recipe to fill the void in my life 
367	5.0	By far the best meal I've ever had! Also the most expensive I've ever had so not somewhere I will become a regular. But really a wonderful experience..It's a lovely spot and walking in you immediately know you've arrived someplace special. We had a window table with a view of the park that was ideal. Service tops! All who came to our table were friendly and helpful.We started with meat fruit which everyone else had raved about, and they were right. The presentation was amazing, it looked like an orange! I also loved the salamuguy, chicken oysters in a horseradish sauce. Could have been my meal.I enjoyed my dinner of roast turbot, but not the mushy vegetables served with. But I am told that's standard fare in England. The side dishes of peas and grebe beans were not mushy so more to my liking.And then dessert! Must have Tipsy cake again sometime. Order at the start as it takes 40 minutes to bake. So worth it!If I could afford this I would go again. For now my memories, and the menu they let me take, will have to keep my belly full.	by far the best meal i ve ever had  also the most expensive i ve ever had so not somewhere i will become a regular  but really a wonderful experience  it s a lovely spot and walking in you immediately know you ve arrived someplace special  we had a window table with a view of the park that was ideal  service tops  all who came to our table were friendly and helpful we started with meat fruit which everyone else had raved about  and they were right  the presentation was amazing  it looked like an orange  i also loved the salamuguy  chicken oysters in a horseradish sauce  could have been my meal i enjoyed my dinner of roast turbot  but not the mushy vegetables served with  but i am told that s standard fare in england  the side dishes of peas and grebe beans were not mushy so more to my liking and then dessert  must have tipsy cake again sometime  order at the start as it takes 40 minutes to bake  so worth it if i could afford this i would go again  for now my memories  and the menu they let me take  will have to keep my belly full 
368	5.0	I am a very serious foodie, and I would say that my dinner here was in my top ten experiences of all time! I loved the ambiance, the service was phenomenal, and the food was outstanding. I think that Heston's creations and menu were absolutely fantastic and purely genius. The most memorable dishes that I had were the meat fruit and the sticky toffee bread pudding. Words can't explain how delicious they were. I loved that these dishes were very original and historically English. I didn't think it was too pricey at all. The only thing I wish I had done differently was come early and had a cocktail or two at the bar. I saw some of the craft cocktails and I am so bummed that I wasn't able to order any. This restaurant is definitely deserving of the accolades.	i am a very serious foodie  and i would say that my dinner here was in my top ten experiences of all time  i loved the ambiance  the service was phenomenal  and the food was outstanding  i think that heston s creations and menu were absolutely fantastic and purely genius  the most memorable dishes that i had were the meat fruit and the sticky toffee bread pudding  words can t explain how delicious they were  i loved that these dishes were very original and historically english  i didn t think it was too pricey at all  the only thing i wish i had done differently was come early and had a cocktail or two at the bar  i saw some of the craft cocktails and i am so bummed that i wasn t able to order any  this restaurant is definitely deserving of the accolades 
369	5.0	I came here last year while on my honeymoon and it was fabulous. The best service and helpful staff. The food was devine and cooked perfectly. I say this because my husband isn't big on fine dining and he really likes this place. So much that we went a 2nd time when they opened in melbourne 2 weeks ago. So our 2nd time was last saturday with our friends from indonesia and they also love it and want to have dinner here again. Our favourite dish and probably everyone elses is the meat fruit. Don't be deceived by this dish, it's foie gras shaped and looks exactly like a real mandarin. I love the idea and the taste of it. Very smooth and silky. My husband really loves the steaks here as they cook it perfectly and it just melts in your mouth. Oh and don't forget to get dessert. yummm! The mouth watering tipsy cake is delicious. Trust me, you'll regret not ordering it. Definitely recommend this place if it's your first time fine dining to get that grwat experience.	i came here last year while on my honeymoon and it was fabulous  the best service and helpful staff  the food was devine and cooked perfectly  i say this because my husband isn t big on fine dining and he really likes this place  so much that we went a 2nd time when they opened in melbourne 2 weeks ago  so our 2nd time was last saturday with our friends from indonesia and they also love it and want to have dinner here again  our favourite dish and probably everyone elses is the meat fruit  don t be deceived by this dish  it s foie gras shaped and looks exactly like a real mandarin  i love the idea and the taste of it  very smooth and silky  my husband really loves the steaks here as they cook it perfectly and it just melts in your mouth  oh and don t forget to get dessert  yummm  the mouth watering tipsy cake is delicious  trust me  you ll regret not ordering it  definitely recommend this place if it s your first time fine dining to get that grwat experience 
370	5.0	When in London eat as Heston would like you to and you will be very happy indeed. It's was surprisingly easy to get a reservation 2 days in advance although it probably helped it was during the week and on the earlier side.While it's billed as being a casual atmosphere, it's casual for a European Michelin restaurant not casual like Michelin restaurants in California are. Suits aren't required and there was almost no ties on the diners but the servers were all wearing either suits or waistcoats and dress pants. The decor is formal in a modern way like Eleven Madison Park. I think I may have been the first table sat but it filled up as the 2 hours I was there passed but never got anywhere close to full. Since I was solo dining I decided to stickl to the appetizers and a dessert rather than having a main course. I had three appetizers and one dessert so the cost was comparable to have a 3 course meal. Expect to pay 100 USD per person without drinks. The service was the best I had in service deprived London. The servers were knowledgeable about the dishes, able to answer questions, offer suggestions but weren't omnipresent.I had the meat fruit, the Salamugundy, Chicken oysters, salsify, marrow bone & horseradish cream  and the Frumenty, Grilled octopus, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse & lovage. The Frumenty was by far my favorite, it tasted as if I was eating the essence of the sea and the octopus was as good as any I had in Barcelona. It was so tender even though it was large pieces. The Meat Fruit which is his famous pate in the shape of an orange was very good but the look was more impressive than the pate. Of course it was probably some of the best duck liver pate I've had. The salamugundy was my least favorite, the chicken was rather bland and everything else on the plate tasted better than it. But still not a single dish would I ever reject if offered again.I appreciated that they were able to run my bill in USD so I didn't have to pay any transaction fee and it was a much better rate than what my bank would have charged. The restaurant appeared to be wheelchair accessible but the bathrooms were down a flight of stair and did not appear to be accessible.It completely met up with my expectation and I would gladly go back.	when in london eat as heston would like you to and you will be very happy indeed  it s was surprisingly easy to get a reservation 2 days in advance although it probably helped it was during the week and on the earlier side while it s billed as being a casual atmosphere  it s casual for a european michelin restaurant not casual like michelin restaurants in california are  suits aren t required and there was almost no ties on the diners but the servers were all wearing either suits or waistcoats and dress pants  the decor is formal in a modern way like eleven madison park  i think i may have been the first table sat but it filled up as the 2 hours i was there passed but never got anywhere close to full  since i was solo dining i decided to stickl to the appetizers and a dessert rather than having a main course  i had three appetizers and one dessert so the cost was comparable to have a 3 course meal  expect to pay 100 usd per person without drinks  the service was the best i had in service deprived london  the servers were knowledgeable about the dishes  able to answer questions  offer suggestions but weren t omnipresent i had the meat fruit  the salamugundy  chicken oysters  salsify  marrow bone   horseradish cream  and the frumenty  grilled octopus  smoked sea broth  pickled dulse   lovage  the frumenty was by far my favorite  it tasted as if i was eating the essence of the sea and the octopus was as good as any i had in barcelona  it was so tender even though it was large pieces  the meat fruit which is his famous pate in the shape of an orange was very good but the look was more impressive than the pate  of course it was probably some of the best duck liver pate i ve had  the salamugundy was my least favorite  the chicken was rather bland and everything else on the plate tasted better than it  but still not a single dish would i ever reject if offered again i appreciated that they were able to run my bill in usd so i didn t have to pay any transaction fee and it was a much better rate than what my bank would have charged  the restaurant appeared to be wheelchair accessible but the bathrooms were down a flight of stair and did not appear to be accessible it completely met up with my expectation and i would gladly go back 
371	3.0	"In a word? Underwhelming. Been to a handful of 2 and 3 Michelin star places and DbHB is easily the worst of the bunch. Not bad by any stretch but also nothing special, at least on my visit. Let's start from the top...When we arrived (and this may be part of the problem we had late reservation at 10:30) we we about 4 minutes early (does that even count?). The hostess immediately said ""well you're early so you'll have to wait"". I asked how long and she responded ""I can't tell you how many MINUTES, have a drink in the bar please"". Just weird. She really set the tone which was just kind of off. Again she wasn't overly rude just kind of standoffish. Part of the fun of trying restaurants is seeing how they balance the people vibe. Some are robotically formal and you marvel at their precision (Per Se) some are tiny and very informal but also precise (Jiro), so I am not criticizing that I found the service a little informal and ""steakhouse-y"" but that the precision expected when a restaurant is supposed to be one of the best in the world was totally lacking. We only sat at the bar long enough to order our drinks then were whisked off to our table. Again, better coordination would have avoided the awkwardness. We now ended up starting what was already a late meal with two full cocktails which meant we sat for 20m finishing those with staff kind of buzzing around wanting to get started (truth be told so did we, we probably should have turfed the drinks but again, just weird, it was they who threw the timing off which again is not the sign of greatness. Once seated menu explanation and the usual pre order banter was great. The sommelier arrived which is where things went downhill. I generally like to ask the Sommelier to pair by course since I've had so many good experiences doing that in the past. For some reason this sommelier read my desire for her to pair to mean that I didn't want to drink more than a glass or two. I enjoy being put in the hands of a competent sommelier but she wasn't getting it so I simply asked her for a recommendation. Again totally tone deaf to what I was looking for. I don't fault the restaurant for this, maybe their wines by the glass aren't suitable for a full meal pairing, but a sign of a great restaurant is partly how well they anticipate and respond to diners and this is far from an unusual request and it was met with complete incomprehension. The rest of the pace of the meal was totally off. We received bread with cocktails still on the table. Didn't get wine until after had started nibbling on bread and our first course arrived about 30s after we received wine and about 2m after the bread. They had to arrange the table like it was an Appleby's to get everything on the table it was just sloppy and felt like they were trying to rush is out. The Meat Fruit is as incredible as everyone says it is, a feast for the eyes and for fans of chicken liver pate the creamiest and redolent of monkfish liver more than chicken liver it's so strong (in a good way). Super yummy and probably the highlight of the meal. However the savoury porridge and frogs legs was a total disappointment. I'd say this dish is actively bad. First off it was lukewarm from the first bite and completely cold by the time we finished. Totally unacceptable but I was in no mood to be sending food back. The frogs legs are panko fried little bits of tasteless nothing, and the green porridge has bits of red beet that when mixed with the porridge turn the whole dish grey. Honestly pretty gross. Cold, tasteless and grey. No thanks. The next course was better timed we had a moment to breathe and I was feeling hopeful. The Iberico pork chop was very good as far as pork chops go, but wasn't making my eyes roll back in my head. It was tasty and warm. I've had better pork chops at home though. My wife's lamb was similar boring. Well prepared and competent preparation but felt like decent home cooking not one of the best restaurants in the world. The sweetbreads on the side were again these little panko breaded tasteless bits, don't know what's up with that. The veg sides are worth describing though, they were the highlight of the meal. Not sure how they prepare the carrots but man, they were amazing. Lightly spiced, still firm with a subtle meaty flavour. Yum. Same thing with the mashed potatoes. Verging on being like soft cheese they were velvety and tasted of fresh cream. Seriously give the veg guy a promotion. We ended with the also worth the hype Tipsy Cake which is like farmhouse buns bathed in butter, booze (Sauternes?) vanilla and sugar with a side of roasted pineapple. My wife went to the bathroom 30s before it arrived and they just left it there for 5m. It was plenty warm when she got back but again, weird for a Michelin star place to be so sloppy. The fresh made ice cream is likewise a fun and surprising end to a meal.

373	5.0	The service and food really could not be faulted. Maybe a slight delay in getting the mains to us, but there was so much to look at, great people watching and peering over at what others were eating. Historical British recipes reinterpreted for modern diners. I swear the waiters and waitresses could read my mind and body language - I didn't have to ask for anything or where the bathroom was.I went to dinner with a girl friend and we had all 3 courses - starting with the recognizable meat fruit (foie gras inside a gelatin mandarin with toast) - subtle mandarin flavour, delicious chicken pate. Roast Marrowbone with escargots - perfect texture, not gummy at all. Mains - Angus fillet - despite my friend having it cooked medium well, it was tender and had a beautiful flavour. Turbot in cider - really juicy fish cooked warm so it retained flavour. Desserts - I didn't really like the brown bread ice cream (it tasted like sourdough ice cream, no sugar) but the salted butter caramel and perry poached pear cubes were a surprisngly delicious combination. The chocolate bar with passion fruit jam and ginger ice cream was also a delicious combination.Don't even hesitate, just go.	the service and food really could not be faulted  maybe a slight delay in getting the mains to us  but there was so much to look at  great people watching and peering over at what others were eating  historical british recipes reinterpreted for modern diners  i swear the waiters and waitresses could read my mind and body language   i didn t have to ask for anything or where the bathroom was i went to dinner with a girl friend and we had all 3 courses   starting with the recognizable meat fruit  foie gras inside a gelatin mandarin with toast    subtle mandarin flavour  delicious chicken pate  roast marrowbone with escargots   perfect texture  not gummy at all  mains   angus fillet   despite my friend having it cooked medium well  it was tender and had a beautiful flavour  turbot in cider   really juicy fish cooked warm so it retained flavour  desserts   i didn t really like the brown bread ice cream  it tasted like sourdough ice cream  no sugar  but the salted butter caramel and perry poached pear cubes were a surprisngly delicious combination  the chocolate bar with passion fruit jam and ginger ice cream was also a delicious combination don t even hesitate  just go 
374	5.0	Wowzers Heston, I think you just whisked me away to food heaven... Having managed to secure my lunchtime table just the day before (what a coo!) I struggled to contain my excitement for 24 hours, while spending the time perusing the menu wondering how I was ever going to make a decision. We arrived at the Mandarin Oriental (London's most expensive hotel) and found our way to the restaurant at the back. We were seated at a table that looked straight into the open plan kitchen from one side and over Hyde Park from the other, what an exceptional setting. It was a battle of heart versus head in deciding whether to stick with the exceptionally well priced set lunch menu (£28 for three courses) or to go al la carte for the much more varied but ever so slightly more expensive menu. Of course, in true foodie fashion, we went off piste and went for the al la carte (well, we will probably only eat here once!). After a gin and tonic aperitif , the wine list came and we gawped at the exceptional prices. £14,000 for one bottle of wine, who does that?? The wine list does favour those with a fuller wallet but we unashamedly plumped for the only bottle of house red at £39, and it was good. Starters came - the signature dish of meat fruits for myself and the bone marrow for my dining companion. The meat fruits is presented beautifully so that it appears as a mandarin on the plate, the whole thing being edible. The flavour was delightful, rich and creamy. For main course I went for the roast turbot with cockle ketchup. This really captured the tastes and textures of the sea and was very good. I also got to try a mouthful of the Blackfoot pork chop which had fantastic flavour. We had both ordered a side of fries and asked politely if they could substitute the ordinary fries for Heston's famous triple cooked chips which they were kind enough to do. Oh my, who would have thought that an ordinary potato could taste so good! I highly recommend that you request the swap if you go. For pudding I had to go for the Tipsy cake, which I was required to pre-order at the start of the meal. Probably my entire daily calories in one dish, but as with all things immensely fattening, it tasted amazing! This dish is also served with the spit-roast pineapple that you can see cooking when you enter the restaurant. Next came the tea menu. As as bit of a tea monster, and someone who doesn't drink coffee, it was refreshing to see a menu that focused more on tea than coffee and I plumped for the silver needle white tea - subtle flavours but tasty and refreshing. This was served alongside an extra pudding - a white chocolate ganache served with a salted caramel biscuit. I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of this as it tasty weirdly of cheese. Now, I love cheese, but my chocolate should never taste of cheese! The service was exceptional and the whole dining experience was a delight. Yes, it was pricey but we could have done it cheaper if we had chosen to. Top marks Heston, another great success.	wowzers heston  i think you just whisked me away to food heaven    having managed to secure my lunchtime table just the day before  what a coo   i struggled to contain my excitement for 24 hours  while spending the time perusing the menu wondering how i was ever going to make a decision  we arrived at the mandarin oriental  london s most expensive hotel  and found our way to the restaurant at the back  we were seated at a table that looked straight into the open plan kitchen from one side and over hyde park from the other  what an exceptional setting  it was a battle of heart versus head in deciding whether to stick with the exceptionally well priced set lunch menu   28 for three courses  or to go al la carte for the much more varied but ever so slightly more expensive menu  of course  in true foodie fashion  we went off piste and went for the al la carte  well  we will probably only eat here once    after a gin and tonic aperitif   the wine list came and we gawped at the exceptional prices   14 000 for one bottle of wine  who does that   the wine list does favour those with a fuller wallet but we unashamedly plumped for the only bottle of house red at  39  and it was good  starters came   the signature dish of meat fruits for myself and the bone marrow for my dining companion  the meat fruits is presented beautifully so that it appears as a mandarin on the plate  the whole thing being edible  the flavour was delightful  rich and creamy  for main course i went for the roast turbot with cockle ketchup  this really captured the tastes and textures of the sea and was very good  i also got to try a mouthful of the blackfoot pork chop which had fantastic flavour  we had both ordered a side of fries and asked politely if they could substitute the ordinary fries for heston s famous triple cooked chips which they were kind enough to do  oh my  who would have thought that an ordinary potato could taste so good  i highly recommend that you request the swap if you go  for pudding i had to go for the tipsy cake  which i was required to pre order at the start of the meal  probably my entire daily calories in one dish  but as with all things immensely fattening  it tasted amazing  this dish is also served with the spit roast pineapple that you can see cooking when you enter the restaurant  next came the tea menu  as as bit of a tea monster  and someone who doesn t drink coffee  it was refreshing to see a menu that focused more on tea than coffee and i plumped for the silver needle white tea   subtle flavours but tasty and refreshing  this was served alongside an extra pudding   a white chocolate ganache served with a salted caramel biscuit  i have to admit that i wasn t a huge fan of this as it tasty weirdly of cheese  now  i love cheese  but my chocolate should never taste of cheese  the service was exceptional and the whole dining experience was a delight  yes  it was pricey but we could have done it cheaper if we had chosen to  top marks heston  another great success

379	5.0	Go Nava, it's your birthday... we're gonna eat 9 courses like it's your birthday...Yeah, so I went to Dinner for lunch on my birthday with four friends in tow.  Thanks to Grant T.'s good bad influence, I was coerced into booking the chef's table.  Once upon a time, the Chef's table was a blanket £1200 for the table with a maximum of 6 people, but now they've made it a bit more user friendly in that it's either £150 per person for lunch or £200 per person for dinner.  Oh, and a helpful hint?  The menu is exactly the same at lunch or at dinner, so why not save £50?!I can't possibly say enough wonderful things about this experience.  The food was amazing.  I won't go into all the courses as Andrew and Grant have already kinda done that.  But I will say that I had lots of favorites, and not a single bad morsel was had.  My favorites were definitely the meat fruit because I'm a pate fiend, the octopus because who knew that octopus could be so tender, and the tipsy cake.  HOLY COW that tipsy cake.  And as most of my friends know, I am a cinnamon hater, so I was delighted to find out that there was no cinnamon in the tipsy cake.  Something which I think is shamefully present in most bread puddings, thus making me unable to order them.Oh, and can I dedicate a whole paragraph to the mash?  Because here it goes.  Oh. My. God.  The mash is the most amazing mash I've ever had.  I think they just gave us some to sample because Andrew was a bit disappointed about the absence of their triple-cooked chips (due to it not being the right time for potatoes.  Heston, you marvelous perfectionist).  Three bowls of mash for 5 people, and Chef Dale put a lone bowl right in front of me... I finished that.  That whole bowl went into my stomach.  I would do it again.  I would have done it again right then and there if I wasn't so full.The Chef's Table experience, outside of the food, was also fantastic.  The service was so lovely, that we just kept chatting with our main host-type-thing long after the meal was over.  Chef Dale came over to deliver dishes and explain them all to us and educated us on Cthulhu fruit.  A joke which only Grant and I get because we're giant nerds who constantly out-nerd each other.Oh, just go.  If you've got the spare cash to do the Chef's Table, do it.  Even if you don't... do it. (It went on a card.  Happy birthday to me!)	go nava  it s your birthday    we re gonna eat 9 courses like it s your birthday   yeah  so i went to dinner for lunch on my birthday with four friends in tow   thanks to grant t  s good bad influence  i was coerced into booking the chef s table   once upon a time  the chef s table was a blanket  1200 for the table with a maximum of 6 people  but now they ve made it a bit more user friendly in that it s either  150 per person for lunch or  200 per person for dinner   oh  and a helpful hint   the menu is exactly the same at lunch or at dinner  so why not save  50  i can t possibly say enough wonderful things about this experience   the food was amazing   i won t go into all the courses as andrew and grant have already kinda done that   but i will say that i had lots of favorites  and not a single bad morsel was had   my favorites were definitely the meat fruit because i m a pate fiend  the octopus because who knew that octopus could be so tender  and the tipsy cake   holy cow that tipsy cake   and as most of my friends know  i am a cinnamon hater  so i was delighted to find out that there was no cinnamon in the tipsy cake   something which i think is shamefully present in most bread puddings  thus making me unable to order them oh  and can i dedicate a whole paragraph to the mash   because here it goes   oh  my  god   the mash is the most amazing mash i ve ever had   i think they just gave us some to sample because andrew was a bit disappointed about the absence of their triple cooked chips  due to it not being the right time for potatoes   heston  you marvelous perfectionist    three bowls of mash for 5 people  and chef dale put a lone bowl right in front of me    i finished that   that whole bowl went into my stomach   i would do it again   i would have done it again right then and there if i wasn t so full the chef s table experience  outside of the food  was also fantastic   the service was so lovely  that we just kept chatting with our main host type thing long after the meal was over   chef dale came over to deliver dishes and explain them all to us and educated us on cthulhu fruit   a joke which only grant and i get because we re giant nerds who constantly out nerd each other oh  just go   if you ve got the spare cash to do the chef s table  do it   even if you don t    do it   it went on a card   happy birthday to me  
380	5.0	By far, one of the best meals of my life.  I recently went here while on a quick trip to London and I eagerly wanted to check it off my list.  Our hotel, Hotel 41, helped us nab a reservation and from the moment we arrived to when we left, it was heaven.A few notes...It's inside the mandarin...when you arrive, you go up a small set of stairs and to your left you'll see a bar...it's right there.  The ambience is just...it's great.The drinks - I am forgetting what my cocktail was called and what my husband's was but both were SO good, especially his.  His was japanese-inspired, in a small round cup...it was green, that's about all I remember.The service - top notch...I mean, would you expect anything else form the #7 restaurant in the world?  From the host to the wait staff...all awesome.  We loved everyone.The food - GET THE MEAT FRUIT.  I am not a huge fan of liver, but I just had to get it and I am so glad I did.  It is really rich but so yummy and they'll ensure you have enough grilled bread to finish it.  It was so good, I don't even remember what my husband's starter was.  Cod in Cider was to die for as was the ribeye.  The mushroom ketchup...outstanding.  For dessert - no question, get the tipsy cake.  I am not a huge fan of desserts, but this was SO good.  My husband is dairy-free and was treated to an assortment of sorbet...all made in-house and delicious.  We did not partake in the ice cream cart, but I wish I had!Lastly, the price - honestly, though expensive, it was not that bad...for being as highly rated as it is, we expected to pay more.  This is now the 3rd Top 50 restaurant we have dined at and out of all three, it was definitely the best in terms of price vs. what you get.Go here!	by far  one of the best meals of my life   i recently went here while on a quick trip to london and i eagerly wanted to check it off my list   our hotel  hotel 41  helped us nab a reservation and from the moment we arrived to when we left  it was heaven a few notes   it s inside the mandarin   when you arrive  you go up a small set of stairs and to your left you ll see a bar   it s right there   the ambience is just   it s great the drinks   i am forgetting what my cocktail was called and what my husband s was but both were so good  especially his   his was japanese inspired  in a small round cup   it was green  that s about all i remember the service   top notch   i mean  would you expect anything else form the  7 restaurant in the world   from the host to the wait staff   all awesome   we loved everyone the food   get the meat fruit   i am not a huge fan of liver  but i just had to get it and i am so glad i did   it is really rich but so yummy and they ll ensure you have enough grilled bread to finish it   it was so good  i don t even remember what my husband s starter was   cod in cider was to die for as was the ribeye   the mushroom ketchup   outstanding   for dessert   no question  get the tipsy cake   i am not a huge fan of desserts  but this was so good   my husband is dairy free and was treated to an assortment of sorbet   all made in house and delicious   we did not partake in the ice cream cart  but i wish i had lastly  the price   honestly  though expensive  it was not that bad   for being as highly rated as it is  we expected to pay more   this is now the 3rd top 50 restaurant we have dined at and out of all three  it was definitely the best in terms of price vs  what you get go here 
381	5.0	In my (little-used) kitchen, I have a number of menus, which I've framed, hanging on my walls. I've got menus from El Bulli and from Jiro. I've got a menu from The Fat Duck from nearly ten years ago now. I'll soon have another, from Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. My dinner was superb.Starting with a glass of NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Rosé, it took only a few moments to decide what I wanted to order. (I'd looked at the menu on line earlier.) I started with a Earl Grey Tea cured Salmon (lemon salad, gentleman's relish, wood sorrel & smoked roe) from a recipe dated c1730. The flavors were subtle. The fish was perfectly prepared and the smokiness from the roe floated above all the flavors of the dish.Moving into red wine territory, for my entree course I ordered the Black Foot Pork Chop (Hispi cabbage, lardo, ham hock & Robert sauce) prepared from an 1820 recipe. I believe this was the best pork chop I've ever eaten. I'd also ordered a side of buttered carrots with caraway. (Apparently these carrots are slow cooked in butter for hours but they maintain their structure and do not get soggy or too soft.) The unctuous fattiness of the pork with the sweetness of the carrots was off-the-charts good. For anybody ordering the Pork Chop I highly suggest you pair it with the carrots.Dessert was Brown Bread Ice Cream salted butter caramel, pear & malted yeast syrup (c. 1830). Wow. Very contemporary...salted caramel flavors are highly popular and this hits it dead on. Spectacular. At the end of my meal I was treated to a surprise. A custom made ice cream cart wheeled up and a miniature ice cream cone was prepared. The ice cream was simple...vanilla custard treated with liquid nitrogen and cranked to offer a superbly smooth concoction which was covered in some sort of apple candy crunch. The liquid nitrogen offered an understandably fun presentation with clouds forming during the cranking.Finally I'll add that the waitstaff offered the proper balance of formal and informal service. Friendly and professional. Very attentive without hovering and always easy to find. The ambiance was surprisingly contemporary which offered an interesting juxtaposition to the antiquity of the recipes.A restaurant of this size and reputation must be terribly difficult to run...especially when you have a platform like Yelp for diners to let their (often idiotic but sometimes insightful) opinions be known. Chefs are a creative bunch. There is a large waitstaff. There is a public with high demands and little commonality other than the ability to afford to eat there. I would not want to be in the shoes of the man who must run this enterprise. The GM, Paul Downie, introduced himself to me last night after letting my admittedly gushing opinion known of my dinner. We chatted for a few minutes and he gave me a short look into the working kitchen. It was Ballet Mécanique as all busy, high-performing kitchens are. He is seemingly making this all work at the highest levels...and he was smiling during the height of Saturday night service. Impressive on all fronts.Most highly recommended.

384	5.0	As anyone reading my reviews might have noticed I am more of a casual eater than a fine dining guy. Still as I got a chance to go and have lunch at a restaurant ranked 7th best in the world I did not have to think twice...I am still so overwhelmed of this experience so I don't really know where to begin my review! :DWe were a party of three and each got our own starter + one of Heston Blumenthal's signature dishes, The Meat fruit, to share. It's a chicken liver & foie gras parfait shaped as a mandarin (the orange color is made with yello). One word: WOW! This stuff, spread over toast, was so good it will make you want to slap your mother. I have never understood how something would make you slap your mama, but if something really would it would be this stuff!Everything that followed looked amazing and tasted even better. For any meat lovers out there I would really recommend the Angus stake. It was by far the most tender and best piece of meat I have ever had. And coming from someone who loves meat that says a lot... I am pretty sure Mr. Blumenthal would not be available to cook deathrow meals but I would still choose this stuff as my last meal!	as anyone reading my reviews might have noticed i am more of a casual eater than a fine dining guy  still as i got a chance to go and have lunch at a restaurant ranked 7th best in the world i did not have to think twice   i am still so overwhelmed of this experience so i don t really know where to begin my review   dwe were a party of three and each got our own starter   one of heston blumenthal s signature dishes  the meat fruit  to share  it s a chicken liver   foie gras parfait shaped as a mandarin  the orange color is made with yello   one word  wow  this stuff  spread over toast  was so good it will make you want to slap your mother  i have never understood how something would make you slap your mama  but if something really would it would be this stuff everything that followed looked amazing and tasted even better  for any meat lovers out there i would really recommend the angus stake  it was by far the most tender and best piece of meat i have ever had  and coming from someone who loves meat that says a lot    i am pretty sure mr  blumenthal would not be available to cook deathrow meals but i would still choose this stuff as my last meal 
385	4.0	"Meat fruit! Honestly, that's all I cared about for days. A friend told me about Dinner by Heston, so I immediately research this place and found a video interviewing Heston. Absolutely fascinating, especially the meat fruit. Located inside the Mandarin Hotel, we had a nice view of Hyde Park. You're immediately started with white and brown ale bread and lightly salted butter. Beware of the French waiter. He asks you if you want more bread, you ponder, he says ""why not?"" and he's right. The meat fruit was the overall winner. It's a tempting orange orb hiding delicious meatiness inside. We savored this dish and I fought my natural inclination to lick it clean. One must adhere to some professionalism while dining here.Next was the pork chop. It was finely presented, though I would have appreciated a more serious knife. It was nice, not lacking in flavor, but wasn't extraordinary. It was forgettable.Dessert featured the tipsy cake (must order first for preparation time) and brown bread ice cream. Excellent presentations for both. The brown bread ice cream was my winner as I scooped through all three layers. The tipsy cake was great too, but I had unrealistic visions of a whole spit roasted pineapple. And forgive for comparing a Heston dessert to a breakfast food, but the tipsy cake reminded me a nice french toast. So again, I enjoyed the brown bread ice cream's flavors challenging my palate.Note: if you sit with a group, be sure to read the inside of your napkin holders.

386	4.0	Meat Fruit, Meat Fruit, Meat Fruit. There, now you get to read it three more times in this list of reviews. Hey, at least you won't forget, and you shouldn't. Because it really is everything you imagine it to be and more. It's just as good as everyone says, it's just as exciting to look at as to taste, and to generously spread onto your lightly toasted bread. It's silky and smooth, and delightfully savory and meaty.Unfortunately I don't remember the details of my meal since that was over two months ago. I remember a porridge of some sort, I remember the octopus appetizer which was a very innovative and successful dish. I remember having a duck breast for my entree which featured a nice, thick, perfectly roasted fatty skin.But mostly I recommend this place because despite the fact that it is a world renowned restaurant, it is shockingly simple. None of this crazy 32 course tasting menus where the plates are choreographed to hit the table all at once. None of the pomp and circumstance of many other restaurants on its level. It's simple. Order everything a la carte. Want an appetizer? Order one. Not that hungry? Ok, then just order an entree. It's a very traditional, easy-going, order and eat restaurant. And as much as we all like to be treated like royalty, sometimes you just want to order what you want without all the silly rules and restrictions that come with a pre fixe or tasting menu.  And the price! The price is shockingly reasonable for one of the world's best restaurants. You don't have to spend your lifetime savings to have a one of a kind culinary experience and Dinner by Heston is a good example of a place where you can still wine and dine yourself, but not have to starve yourself for the rest of the month to make up for it.	meat fruit  meat fruit  meat fruit  there  now you get to read it three more times in this list of reviews  hey  at least you won t forget  and you shouldn t  because it really is everything you imagine it to be and more  it s just as good as everyone says  it s just as exciting to look at as to taste  and to generously spread onto your lightly toasted bread  it s silky and smooth  and delightfully savory and meaty unfortunately i don t remember the details of my meal since that was over two months ago  i remember a porridge of some sort  i remember the octopus appetizer which was a very innovative and successful dish  i remember having a duck breast for my entree which featured a nice  thick  perfectly roasted fatty skin but mostly i recommend this place because despite the fact that it is a world renowned restaurant  it is shockingly simple  none of this crazy 32 course tasting menus where the plates are choreographed to hit the table all at once  none of the pomp and circumstance of many other restaurants on its level  it s simple  order everything a la carte  want an appetizer  order one  not that hungry  ok  then just order an entree  it s a very traditional  easy going  order and eat restaurant  and as much as we all like to be treated like royalty  sometimes you just want to order what you want without all the silly rules and restrictions that come with a pre fixe or tasting menu   and the price  the price is shockingly reasonable for one of the world s best restaurants  you don t have to spend your lifetime savings to have a one of a kind culinary experience and dinner by heston is a good example of a place where you can still wine and dine yourself  but not have to starve yourself for the rest of the month to make up for it 
387	5.0	My visit to Dinner was a Christmas present from my boyfriend who hates pretentiousness, is largely unmoved by posh food and worst of all is a vegetarian. You could say that it was a somewhat altruistic present, but by the end of the evening even he was completely and utterly won over.I on the other hand was sold from the second we walked into the hotel and proceeded to giggle with delight at the spiced duck (fresh from the sous vide machine) and Tipsy Cake. The Vegetarian had the one meat-free option on the menu, essentially posh cauliflower cheese. But you have to hand it to the chefs, to make up for the sad lack of meat or fish, they really did pull out all the stops on every element and it too was delicious. He finished up with the Chocolate Bar pudding which was stunning, but not as good as my Tipsy Cake (unlucky). We ordered a bottle of house red from the sommelier and he didn't even blink at our plebby choice of vino. My one regret was not having the Meat Fruit starter, but even I'm not mean enough to make a vegetarian pay for delicious but cruel foie gras. Shame. I should add a small disclaimer that I'd never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant before so would probably have oohed and ahhed whatever they'd served, but for me the whole thing was a massive thrill. High recommended.	my visit to dinner was a christmas present from my boyfriend who hates pretentiousness  is largely unmoved by posh food and worst of all is a vegetarian  you could say that it was a somewhat altruistic present  but by the end of the evening even he was completely and utterly won over i on the other hand was sold from the second we walked into the hotel and proceeded to giggle with delight at the spiced duck  fresh from the sous vide machine  and tipsy cake  the vegetarian had the one meat free option on the menu  essentially posh cauliflower cheese  but you have to hand it to the chefs  to make up for the sad lack of meat or fish  they really did pull out all the stops on every element and it too was delicious  he finished up with the chocolate bar pudding which was stunning  but not as good as my tipsy cake  unlucky   we ordered a bottle of house red from the sommelier and he didn t even blink at our plebby choice of vino  my one regret was not having the meat fruit starter  but even i m not mean enough to make a vegetarian pay for delicious but cruel foie gras  shame  i should add a small disclaimer that i d never been to a michelin starred restaurant before so would probably have oohed and ahhed whatever they d served  but for me the whole thing was a massive thrill  high recommended 
388	4.0	I can see why people are giving Dinner by Heston Blumenthal 5 stars and I probably would have done the same if I had gone for a different main course.We decided to share the starters and got the meat fruit and octopus dish. The meat fruit is AMAZING, from the presentation to the actual taste and flavour- just perfect! It is not a coincidence that every reviewer raves about this-it is a must have! The octopus was good, though I'm not a fan generally speaking, so the fact that I actually thought it was OK means it was probably great as well. For the main dish I ordered something off the menu, some beef special of the day. Wasn't great. A piece of very rare beef, you tender yes but I would have preferred a cooked flavor to it. One friend went for the Angus steak which looked good (and is served with chips) and the others went for a shared meat option which was alright. As far as dessert is concerned, don't think-just do it! The Tipsy cake is divine! I didn't expect it but it was recommended so we went for it. We also got the cheese platter-a must for any cheese lover and the piece de resistance was the nitrogen ice cream-great presentation, yummy ice cream. I'd definitely go with these recommendations for starter and dessert, be careful what to order for the main course.	i can see why people are giving dinner by heston blumenthal 5 stars and i probably would have done the same if i had gone for a different main course we decided to share the starters and got the meat fruit and octopus dish  the meat fruit is amazing  from the presentation to the actual taste and flavour  just perfect  it is not a coincidence that every reviewer raves about this it is a must have  the octopus was good  though i m not a fan generally speaking  so the fact that i actually thought it was ok means it was probably great as well  for the main dish i ordered something off the menu  some beef special of the day  wasn t great  a piece of very rare beef  you tender yes but i would have preferred a cooked flavor to it  one friend went for the angus steak which looked good  and is served with chips  and the others went for a shared meat option which was alright  as far as dessert is concerned  don t think just do it  the tipsy cake is divine  i didn t expect it but it was recommended so we went for it  we also got the cheese platter a must for any cheese lover and the piece de resistance was the nitrogen ice cream great presentation  yummy ice cream  i d definitely go with these recommendations for starter and dessert  be careful what to order for the main course 
389	5.0	After watching hours of Heston's Feast and theme shows about the best french fry ever, I invited my husband to Dinner for his birthday.We arrived to the beautiful Mandarine hotel and were recommended a few pre-dinner cocktails while they prepared our table. As one would expect, amazing cocktails! We had a really late reservation, so I have to admit after the second cocktail we were happy and tipsy.Once seated, I went for the meat fruit as the starter; I haven't watched hours of Heston's Feast for nothing :-) I just loved that it actually looked like a fruit, down to the peel and all. Also, I quite fancied that every dish came with a circa date for when it was invented - the meat fruit c. 1500.  For main, we had the Bone in Rib of Hereford Prime for 2 people, c. 1800, with Heston's famous French fries - the meat was really good, the fries divine - and plenty of it. But still, for me, the starter was the highlight. We were to stuffed to truly appreciate the dessert, but the combination ice cream / fruit / cake was really tasty.At the end of our meal, they brought us a choco-mousse thing in a glass with 'happy birthday' written beautifully on the side. A great way to finish off an amazing meal. It was a great night out. I'll give the food 4 and the overall experience a 5.	after watching hours of heston s feast and theme shows about the best french fry ever  i invited my husband to dinner for his birthday we arrived to the beautiful mandarine hotel and were recommended a few pre dinner cocktails while they prepared our table  as one would expect  amazing cocktails  we had a really late reservation  so i have to admit after the second cocktail we were happy and tipsy once seated  i went for the meat fruit as the starter  i haven t watched hours of heston s feast for nothing     i just loved that it actually looked like a fruit  down to the peel and all  also  i quite fancied that every dish came with a circa date for when it was invented   the meat fruit c  1500   for main  we had the bone in rib of hereford prime for 2 people  c  1800  with heston s famous french fries   the meat was really good  the fries divine   and plenty of it  but still  for me  the starter was the highlight  we were to stuffed to truly appreciate the dessert  but the combination ice cream   fruit   cake was really tasty at the end of our meal  they brought us a choco mousse thing in a glass with  happy birthday  written beautifully on the side  a great way to finish off an amazing meal  it was a great night out  i ll give the food 4 and the overall experience a 5 
390	5.0	"I went here at the end of February, without really realizing what a scene it would turn out to be. I thought, ""Ok, new restaurant, availability on OpenTable, why not?""I actually thought this place was amazing. But my expectations were so high once I realized who the chef was that I'm not sure whether this place met or exceeded them.You're welcome to read all of the different reviews where they tell you that the dishes at this restaurant were based on historic British recipes. And they'll also tell you that these are significantly sheeshed-up versions of classic recipes.We started out, as most do, with the meat fruit. This is a ball of liver wrapped up to look like a mandarin orange. As a person who always needs more vitamin B12 and has learned to love liver, this was fascinating and delicious. Quite a work of art.The rest of the dishes were both delicious and filling. This is not the sort of place where they bring you 12 tiny courses. You get three big courses. I think those who are expecting a Fat Duck experience will find something incredible but it's not a tasting menu.Gluten-free notes: They serve gluten-free bread! Even your meat-fruit will come out with gluten-free bread to spread it on."	i went here at the end of february  without really realizing what a scene it would turn out to be  i thought   ok  new restaurant  availability on opentable  why not  i actually thought this place was amazing  but my expectations were so high once i realized who the chef was that i m not sure whether this place met or exceeded them you re welcome to read all of the different reviews where they tell you that the dishes at this restaurant were based on historic british recipes  and they ll also tell you that these are significantly sheeshed up versions of classic recipes we started out  as most do  with the meat fruit  this is a ball of liver wrapped up to look like a mandarin orange  as a person who always needs more vitamin b12 and has learned to love liver  this was fascinating and delicious  quite a work of art the rest of the dishes were both delicious and filling  this is not the sort of place where they bring you 12 tiny courses  you get three big courses  i think those who are expecting a fat duck experience will find something incredible but it s not a tasting menu gluten free notes  they serve gluten free bread  even your meat fruit will come out with gluten free bread to spread it on 
391	5.0	It was everything I thought it would be!  Beautiful space!  Beyond amazing service!  Inventive, gorgeous food!  We went for lunch with our well traveled,well behaved, yet picky 7 year old daughter.  A bit risky, I know, but it was a huge success! I was inspired after reading about HB's travels to France as a child and how these travels influenced him.  While we've taken our little one to many great places, this was her first 2**.  Our waiter was so gracious and suggested she try the chicken (not on the menu).  She loved it and though she wasn't quite ready to try the Meat Fruit, for example, I think the experience was invaluable.	it was everything i thought it would be   beautiful space   beyond amazing service   inventive  gorgeous food   we went for lunch with our well traveled well behaved  yet picky 7 year old daughter   a bit risky  i know  but it was a huge success  i was inspired after reading about hb s travels to france as a child and how these travels influenced him   while we ve taken our little one to many great places  this was her first 2     our waiter was so gracious and suggested she try the chicken  not on the menu    she loved it and though she wasn t quite ready to try the meat fruit  for example  i think the experience was invaluable 
392	4.0	Dinner by Heston is one of the most esteemed London restaurants, run by arguably Britain's most famous chef. It's located inside of the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge, and while the décor was a little old school for my tastes, our table had a great view overlooking Hyde Park. I was actually surprised to find out that the restaurant is a la carte and not a tasting menu. After consulting with our server, we decided on the meat fruit, rice and flesh, and salamagundy for starters, and the powdered duck breast, roast Iberico pork chop, and chicken cooked with lettuce for the mains. The meat fruit lived up to all the hype; it is one of Heston's most famous dishes and the orange gel paired really well with the richness of the chicken liver parfait. We briefly considered ordering two of these, but one between three people turned out to be the perfect amount. Both the rice and flesh and salamagundy were good but not particularly memorable - if you are curious, chicken oysters are a fatty part of the chicken on the back of the leg that gets no exercise, thus it has the texture resembling that of an oyster. We also got the chips to try the mushroom ketchup, and for some reason I didn't really taste the whole mushroom thing. As for the mains, the duck was served very rare, but was very enjoyable; the chicken tasted like concentrated essence of chicken - that's the best I can describe it, but it came highly recommended and is far from your ordinary chicken; and the pork was very nice as well. For dessert we got the tipsy cake and the spring tart - the tipsy cake was great and the pineapple was just the right touch; the spring tart was ok but I wouldn't be dying to have that again. We saw nitrogen ice cream being made at nearby tables, but were told there is a minimum spend so that you can't just get one of them. Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience and was indeed impressed by Heston's most well-known dishes. I can see why people come here, but also see how it might be best enjoyed on an expense account!	dinner by heston is one of the most esteemed london restaurants  run by arguably britain s most famous chef  it s located inside of the mandarin oriental in knightsbridge  and while the d cor was a little old school for my tastes  our table had a great view overlooking hyde park  i was actually surprised to find out that the restaurant is a la carte and not a tasting menu  after consulting with our server  we decided on the meat fruit  rice and flesh  and salamagundy for starters  and the powdered duck breast  roast iberico pork chop  and chicken cooked with lettuce for the mains  the meat fruit lived up to all the hype  it is one of heston s most famous dishes and the orange gel paired really well with the richness of the chicken liver parfait  we briefly considered ordering two of these  but one between three people turned out to be the perfect amount  both the rice and flesh and salamagundy were good but not particularly memorable   if you are curious  chicken oysters are a fatty part of the chicken on the back of the leg that gets no exercise  thus it has the texture resembling that of an oyster  we also got the chips to try the mushroom ketchup  and for some reason i didn t really taste the whole mushroom thing  as for the mains  the duck was served very rare  but was very enjoyable  the chicken tasted like concentrated essence of chicken   that s the best i can describe it  but it came highly recommended and is far from your ordinary chicken  and the pork was very nice as well  for dessert we got the tipsy cake and the spring tart   the tipsy cake was great and the pineapple was just the right touch  the spring tart was ok but i wouldn t be dying to have that again  we saw nitrogen ice cream being made at nearby tables  but were told there is a minimum spend so that you can t just get one of them  overall  i enjoyed the dining experience and was indeed impressed by heston s most well known dishes  i can see why people come here  but also see how it might be best enjoyed on an expense account 
393	5.0	Amazing.   Went for my 60th Birthday.  The service, food, ambiance and drinks fantastic.   I really liked the concept and thought the choices of food were excellent.  The bone marrow escargot was incredible.  I live in Toronto and we have great restaurants, but nothing compares.  I travel extensively and try to seek out the best a city has.  This is at the top of the wrung.  My first choice when I head back to London.	amazing    went for my 60th birthday   the service  food  ambiance and drinks fantastic    i really liked the concept and thought the choices of food were excellent   the bone marrow escargot was incredible   i live in toronto and we have great restaurants  but nothing compares   i travel extensively and try to seek out the best a city has   this is at the top of the wrung   my first choice when i head back to london 
394	5.0	I visited Dinner by Heston for lunch and had great expectations since I tried the magnificent Fat Duck in Bray.Compared to The Fat Duck where you get around 18 courses, this new restaurant by Heston Blumenthal is more for a 4-5 course dinner. The molecular gastronomy is not in focus here - it's about honest cooking at its best. Here the concept is traditional english cooking using recipes from the past 700 years. And this is done We started out with the Meat Fruit which is an amazing dish. But more bread is needed at it took almost 10 minutes to get this - not acceptable.I then had the pork chops. The taste of the meat was excellent but it was a little bit dry. The spelt, ham hock, turnip and Robert sauce was absolutely great. Perfect companions to the meat. I ordered the mash potato as a side dish and it was out of this world - probably with significant help of butter. The final dish was the Tipsy cake with the spit roast pineapple. One of the best desserts I ever had - simplex and like being in a foetal position. You feel warm and loved.The food is so great, warm and just so easy to love. It's really comfort food. But unfortunately the room was extremely noisy (probably many americans?) and a bit hectic - this is not a perfect match for this food. The food felt like heavy carpets and a fireplace, but the room was almost the opposite.The pricing was very, very fair. We payed 220 pounds for 3 courses for two persons including Champaign and a glass of white wine. Very decent.But, next time I'm in London I will be here again - if I can get a table.	i visited dinner by heston for lunch and had great expectations since i tried the magnificent fat duck in bray compared to the fat duck where you get around 18 courses  this new restaurant by heston blumenthal is more for a 4 5 course dinner  the molecular gastronomy is not in focus here   it s about honest cooking at its best  here the concept is traditional english cooking using recipes from the past 700 years  and this is done we started out with the meat fruit which is an amazing dish  but more bread is needed at it took almost 10 minutes to get this   not acceptable i then had the pork chops  the taste of the meat was excellent but it was a little bit dry  the spelt  ham hock  turnip and robert sauce was absolutely great  perfect companions to the meat  i ordered the mash potato as a side dish and it was out of this world   probably with significant help of butter  the final dish was the tipsy cake with the spit roast pineapple  one of the best desserts i ever had   simplex and like being in a foetal position  you feel warm and loved the food is so great  warm and just so easy to love  it s really comfort food  but unfortunately the room was extremely noisy  probably many americans   and a bit hectic   this is not a perfect match for this food  the food felt like heavy carpets and a fireplace  but the room was almost the opposite the pricing was very  very fair  we payed 220 pounds for 3 courses for two persons including champaign and a glass of white wine  very decent but  next time i m in london i will be here again   if i can get a table 
395	5.0	Stunning food and equally wonderful service.  My husband and I enjoyed a lovely dinner on Easter and the staff could not have been nicer.  Our table at the window overlooked Hyde Park at dusk...beautiful! As for the meal:  The starters (Rice and Flesh - a beautiful saffron risotto with calf tail - and the Earl Grey cured salmon) were beautifully presented, and we couldn't decide who ordered the better dish.  Our main dishes of ribeye and duck were similarly excellent and perfectly prepared.  To top off the meal, the special chocolate torte cake (decorated for my birthday) capped off the night well.  Highly recommended!	stunning food and equally wonderful service   my husband and i enjoyed a lovely dinner on easter and the staff could not have been nicer   our table at the window overlooked hyde park at dusk   beautiful  as for the meal   the starters  rice and flesh   a beautiful saffron risotto with calf tail   and the earl grey cured salmon  were beautifully presented  and we couldn t decide who ordered the better dish   our main dishes of ribeye and duck were similarly excellent and perfectly prepared   to top off the meal  the special chocolate torte cake  decorated for my birthday  capped off the night well   highly recommended 
396	5.0	A delicious and unique dining experience! I went with a foodie friend who knew exactly what to recommend. We started with the meat fruit, which was like nothing I've ever had before: it had a mix really of the meaty chicken liver flavor and the mandarine orange taste. Lovely presentation. Then I had the Angus filet, which was perfectly prepared. Finally, the tipsy fruit and ice cream were a real treat! Tipsy fruit is a spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche pastry soaked in brandy. The ice cream is made on a cart before your eyes, using liquid nitrogen! I have never seen anything like it! Service was great, especially the sommeliere from HK who was very knowledgeable. Plus, the cocktail of the day served at the Mandarin Oriental bar was unique and a perfect way to start the experience! Dinner cost about £100 per person.	a delicious and unique dining experience  i went with a foodie friend who knew exactly what to recommend  we started with the meat fruit  which was like nothing i ve ever had before  it had a mix really of the meaty chicken liver flavor and the mandarine orange taste  lovely presentation  then i had the angus filet  which was perfectly prepared  finally  the tipsy fruit and ice cream were a real treat  tipsy fruit is a spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche pastry soaked in brandy  the ice cream is made on a cart before your eyes  using liquid nitrogen  i have never seen anything like it  service was great  especially the sommeliere from hk who was very knowledgeable  plus  the cocktail of the day served at the mandarin oriental bar was unique and a perfect way to start the experience  dinner cost about  100 per person 
397	4.0	I was half expecting Oompa Loompas to burst out singing a song, turning on a chocolate river, and then Heston donning a Willy Wonka hat and plucking meat fruits from his meat fruit tree.  (Suggestion to management)Aside from than the lack of Oompa Loompas, dinner at Dinner was lovely.  It was a much more traditional restaurant than expected, with its safe dishes.  Not that the 50 Best Restaurants list matters much at all, but I would definitely argue Eleven Madison Park is way ahead of Dinner in terms of taste and innovation.  But overall, we did enjoy our evening here.Starters:We ordered the £15 meat fruit, creamy foie gras encased in a citris gel which came with a piece of toasted bread.  Found it quite puzzling they gave only one slice, when the foie gras portion clearly demanded 4 slices.  The waiters are very generous with providing more table bread though.  Had to agree with Yee Gan O who noticed it was a bit bland.Also ordered the £14 Savoury Porridge, which came with frog legs and a green, brothy porridge.  Frog legs were fried and juicy (tasted like chicken in case you were  curious), wasn't excited about the consistency of the porridge.Mains:Ordered the £34.00 Spiced Pidgeon and the £30.00 Pork Chop, as well as green beans and buttered black cabbage (£4 each, I would skip them unless you really want vegetables). Both meats were prepared very well.  Our waiter told us the pork was prepared at low heat for 16 hours, and it shows- the pork was incredibly slippery and buttery.  The pidgeon was prepared medium, and it was amazing how easily my knife slipped right in.Desserts:£12 Tipsy Cake was served with a caramelized brioche doused in a creamy sauce and grilled pineapple.  Like the £10 Quaking Pudding (which has some serious wobble skills), the Tipsy Cake was good but nothing memorable.Drinks:Drinks are pricey here, running from £13 to £20.  They have an extensive selection with images of the types of glasses used for the drinks, but I found the drinks we ordered a bit disappointing. Saigon Sling was served in a cool O shaped glass.Service:Very friendly service.  If you sit next to the kitchen, you can watch the kitchen staff at work behind the glass window.	i was half expecting oompa loompas to burst out singing a song  turning on a chocolate river  and then heston donning a willy wonka hat and plucking meat fruits from his meat fruit tree    suggestion to management aside from than the lack of oompa loompas  dinner at dinner was lovely   it was a much more traditional restaurant than expected  with its safe dishes   not that the 50 best restaurants list matters much at all  but i would definitely argue eleven madison park is way ahead of dinner in terms of taste and innovation   but overall  we did enjoy our evening here starters we ordered the  15 meat fruit  creamy foie gras encased in a citris gel which came with a piece of toasted bread   found it quite puzzling they gave only one slice  when the foie gras portion clearly demanded 4 slices   the waiters are very generous with providing more table bread though   had to agree with yee gan o who noticed it was a bit bland also ordered the  14 savoury porridge  which came with frog legs and a green  brothy porridge   frog legs were fried and juicy  tasted like chicken in case you were  curious   wasn t excited about the consistency of the porridge mains ordered the  34 00 spiced pidgeon and the  30 00 pork chop  as well as green beans and buttered black cabbage   4 each  i would skip them unless you really want vegetables   both meats were prepared very well   our waiter told us the pork was prepared at low heat for 16 hours  and it shows  the pork was incredibly slippery and buttery   the pidgeon was prepared medium  and it was amazing how easily my knife slipped right in desserts  12 tipsy cake was served with a caramelized brioche doused in a creamy sauce and grilled pineapple   like the  10 quaking pudding  which has some serious wobble skills   the tipsy cake was good but nothing memorable drinks drinks are pricey here  running from  13 to  20   they have an extensive selection with images of the types of glasses used for the drinks  but i found the drinks we ordered a bit disappointing  saigon sling was served in a cool o shaped glass service very friendly service   if you sit next to the kitchen  you can watch the kitchen staff at work behind the glass window 
398	4.0	The whole experience was exquisite, as I imagined it to be.  Service staff was extremely attentive, the champagne trolley was a nice touch and the food was exceptionally memorable.I had to order the Meat Fruit due to the interesting name.  The chicken liver parfait that lived inside what looks like the outer layer of a mandarin  was light in texture and taste but offered just enough of substantive kick when eaten alone and on the grilled bread that came with it.For the main course I ordered off the menu: pork belly with spelt covered by a thin layer of lard and doused with Robert sauce (kind of a pork au jus).  The pork belly itself was cooked for 30 hours and was heavenly.  What didn't work for me was the richness of the Robert sauce.  It was overpowering enough for me to regret not ordering the rib eye.  Saving the best for last.... The Tipsy Cake.  The soft warm brioche soaked in some sort of liqueor was done perfectly, great consistency and just the amount of sweetness.  Be warned that you may be intoxicated just from the dessert itself... Hence the name I suppose.  It comes with roasted glazed pineapple that practically melts in your mouth.I would definitely go again for a special occassion.	the whole experience was exquisite  as i imagined it to be   service staff was extremely attentive  the champagne trolley was a nice touch and the food was exceptionally memorable i had to order the meat fruit due to the interesting name   the chicken liver parfait that lived inside what looks like the outer layer of a mandarin  was light in texture and taste but offered just enough of substantive kick when eaten alone and on the grilled bread that came with it for the main course i ordered off the menu  pork belly with spelt covered by a thin layer of lard and doused with robert sauce  kind of a pork au jus    the pork belly itself was cooked for 30 hours and was heavenly   what didn t work for me was the richness of the robert sauce   it was overpowering enough for me to regret not ordering the rib eye   saving the best for last     the tipsy cake   the soft warm brioche soaked in some sort of liqueor was done perfectly  great consistency and just the amount of sweetness   be warned that you may be intoxicated just from the dessert itself    hence the name i suppose   it comes with roasted glazed pineapple that practically melts in your mouth i would definitely go again for a special occassion 
399	5.0	Dinner at Heston B lived up to its high expectations. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the service was amazing. We felt so welcome. Every staff person we walked by (and there are lots of staff) greeted us warmly.The sommelier was tremendously helpful, and took a ton of time to describe different wines to us, and help us find the perfect wine to match our tastes. This was in stark contrast to the really rushed (almost bordering on rude) service we got two nights ago from the sommelier at Joel Robuchon in Paris.We ended up selecting a delicious 2009 Bordeaux from Duluc de Branaire-Ducru from Saint Julien in the Loire Valley.Then, our head waiter came and we asked him for his recommendations. He spent almost 10 minutes with us, describing his favorite dishes in mouth-watering detail, where the food was sourced from, how the dishes were prepared. It was amazing. My wife and I were even more impressed with the restaurant's attentive and amazingly friendly service.The service wan't stuffy at all. Everyone was cracking jokes, and being super friendly.Here's a breakdown of our meal:1) White and sourdough bread - really really good. Like Fat Duck good. The bread crust was wonderfully crispy, and the center moist and delicious. I could almost pick up a faint aroma of coffee grounds in the crust.2) Meat Fruit - truly amazing. Chicken liver pate hidden in the faux gelatin shell of a mandarin orange. When served, it looks like you're being presented with a clementine orange and a toast point. However, the minute you cut into the fruit, you know you're in for a different kind of an experience. The citrus of the fruit exterior perfectly complemented the fattiness of the chicken liver3) Frumenty - Grilled octopus with smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage. This was a really, really solid starter. The smokiness of the broth was amazing and the octopus was really tender4) Chicken cooked with lettuces, served with grilled onion emulsion, spiced celeriac sauce and oyster leaves - second best chicken dish I ever had, after Chateaubriand in Paris. Chicken was so fragrant and tender. Nearly melt in your mouth good5) Roast Iberico Pork Chop served with pointy cabbage, onions, and Robert sauce. The pork was prepared a perfect medium rare. It is nearly impossible to find pork cooked this well anywhere. Usually, in my experience, pork ends up getting overcooked. This particular pork comes from a pig that is allowed to roam in its own private acre of land, foraging naturally on acorns. Basically, it's living the high life, until, of course, it's slaughtered and turned into an amazing dish at Heston B6) A side of triple fried chips. Really yummy, especially after dipping into the chicken soup7) Tipsy Cake - the dessert that these guys are famous for. Spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche cake. Wow, just wow. I don't usually like desserts, but this one is magnificent. The cake is creamy, delicious, and pairs perfectly with the roasted pineapple8) Sambocade - Goats milk cheesecake with elderflower and apple, perry poached pear, and smoked candied walnuts. Another solid dessert. The apple inside the cheesecake nicely cuts the sharpness of the goat cheese9) Chocolate ganache infused with earl gray, and a fennel seed cracker	dinner at heston b lived up to its high expectations  from the moment we stepped into the restaurant  the service was amazing  we felt so welcome  every staff person we walked by  and there are lots of staff  greeted us warmly the sommelier was tremendously helpful  and took a ton of time to describe different wines to us  and help us find the perfect wine to match our tastes  this was in stark contrast to the really rushed  almost bordering on rude  service we got two nights ago from the sommelier at joel robuchon in paris we ended up selecting a delicious 2009 bordeaux from duluc de branaire ducru from saint julien in the loire valley then  our head waiter came and we asked him for his recommendations  he spent almost 10 minutes with us  describing his favorite dishes in mouth watering detail  where the food was sourced from  how the dishes were prepared  it was amazing  my wife and i were even more impressed with the restaurant s attentive and amazingly friendly service the service wan t stuffy at all  everyone was cracking jokes  and being super friendly here s a breakdown of our meal 1  white and sourdough bread   really really good  like fat duck good  the bread crust was wonderfully crispy  and the center moist and delicious  i could almost pick up a faint aroma of coffee grounds in the crust 2  meat fruit   truly amazing  chicken liver pate hidden in the faux gelatin shell of a mandarin orange  when served  it looks like you re being presented with a clementine orange and a toast point  however  the minute you cut into the fruit  you know you re in for a different kind of an experience  the citrus of the fruit exterior perfectly complemented the fattiness of the chicken liver3  frumenty   grilled octopus with smoked sea broth  pickled dulse and lovage  this was a really  really solid starter  the smokiness of the broth was amazing and the octopus was really tender4  chicken cooked with lettuces  served with grilled onion emulsion  spiced celeriac sauce and oyster leaves   second best chicken dish i ever had  after chateaubriand in paris  chicken was so fragrant and tender  nearly melt in your mouth good5  roast iberico pork chop served with pointy cabbage  onions  and robert sauce  the pork was prepared a perfect medium rare  it is nearly impossible to find pork cooked this well anywhere  usually  in my experience  pork ends up getting overcooked  this particular pork comes from a pig that is allowed to roam in its own private acre of land  foraging naturally on acorns  basically  it s living the high life  until  of course  it s slaughtered and turned into an amazing dish at heston b6  a side of triple fried chips  really yummy  especially after dipping into the chicken soup7  tipsy cake   the dessert that these guys are famous for  spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche cake  wow  just wow  i don t usually like desserts  but this one is magnificent  the cake is creamy  delicious  and pairs perfectly with the roasted pineapple8  sambocade   goats milk cheesecake with elderflower and apple  perry poached pear  and smoked candied walnuts  another solid dessert  the apple inside the cheesecake nicely cuts the sharpness of the goat cheese9  chocolate ganache infused with earl gray  and a fennel seed cracker

I think the food is good, but the mains are not something that you might not be able to find elsewhere. The starters though might be a bit more special. I would really like to commend the customer service though as I wanted something without that much sugar and they did give appropriate recommendations.	i really liked my meal at this place  very delicious british food and amazing customer service   don t come when hungry though  portions will not be supersized  i think the food is good  but the mains are not something that you might not be able to find elsewhere  the starters though might be a bit more special  i would really like to commend the customer service though as i wanted something without that much sugar and they did give appropriate recommendations

402	5.0	Terrific restaurant, and I shall be going back there (though maybe when there is enough new stuff on the menu).We snagged a last minute table for 4 on a Friday night and after quite a few exceptional tasting menus recently I was looking forward to a more standard 3 course dinner. The 3 courses were generous, gorgeous, brilliantly executed and generally just awesome. I got the salamugundy, pigeon and tipsy cake, which I would highly recommend, but my decision were heavily swayed by the fact my girlfriend got the meat fruit and the steak, otherwise I probably would have got those two. The tipsy cake was out of this world amazing and the meat fruit was the best foie gras I've ever had (plus amazing bread). I'd definitely recommend getting those two courses, or at least making someone on your table get them and taking some of their's! The main courses were a bit more difficult to choose between but the steak and the reduced sauce it comes with were perfect and is the best steak I've ever had, and the pigeon was more delicate than I've had before and was a bit more like quail texture than usual, but still tasted amazing.We finished things off by splitting some liquid nitrogen ice creams and a little ganache with coffee.Overall, I had high expectations and it smashed them out of the park. It wasn't really that expensive either really, it was about £100 a head for 3 courses, plus wine, a cocktail each, ice cream, and coffee - I know I've spent more on much less! Save. Go.

404	4.0	"I was excited to score reservations at the ""#7th Best Restaurant in the World,"" by Heston Blumenthal, the same chef behind the Fat Duck. The restaurant is housed in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, and it definitely feels like a hotel restaurant, with a somewhat corporate and sleek vibe. It seems like a better place for a business dinner than for an intimate date.Through a mix-up in our appetizer order, we were graciously allowed to sample 3 of their appetizers: Meat Fruit, Savoury Porridge, and Frumenty.The Meat Fruit is as wonderful as they say. A foie gras pate molded into the shape and appearance of a mandarin orange and presented with toast. I have to say I was more excited about how dead-on this foie gras resembled an orange than I was with the actual taste of the appetizer. The Frumenty was also very good, probably the best seared octupus I've had. Only the Savoury Porridge fell flat: an ill-fitting concoction of frog legs, shaved radish, and porridge that didn't really seem to belong together or meld in any comprehensible way.For entrees I had the pork chop and she the duck. The pork is a massive, hulking chop that is lined generously with fat. I kind of felt like a caveman eating it. It's served alongside this cabbage / ham hock creation that I felt was more delicious than the main.And desserts: I placed my order for the Tipsy Cake when I ordered at the beginning. It's essentially this brioche cake that's been soaked in brandy and then served alongside this perfectly whittled, grilled slice of pineapple. One of the best desserts I've had in a long time.All the items on the menu hearken back to some element of Britain's culinary history, so each item will have a date of its origin / genealogy as well, which was very cool.

405	5.0	What a treat! Heston's London based restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge is fabulous! What I love most is that even though the setting is posh, the staff are so lovely and make you feel like you've been there before and you are all old friends. No pretentiousness or stuffiness at all. Food is amazing! Menu based on Old English style food. The Meat fruit was as I expected. Fantastic, melt in your mouth! yummmm....Would love to eat there every week, but alas, it's a bit on the pricey side. Although not as pricy as The Fat Duck. The waiting list seems more managable than The Fat Duck too. Defo recommend if you can!	what a treat  heston s london based restaurant at the mandarin oriental hotel in knightsbridge is fabulous  what i love most is that even though the setting is posh  the staff are so lovely and make you feel like you ve been there before and you are all old friends  no pretentiousness or stuffiness at all  food is amazing  menu based on old english style food  the meat fruit was as i expected  fantastic  melt in your mouth  yummmm    would love to eat there every week  but alas  it s a bit on the pricey side  although not as pricy as the fat duck  the waiting list seems more managable than the fat duck too  defo recommend if you can

My wife got the strawberry tart dessert. there was a sorbet/ice cream with it that was strawberry verbena...one of the best things ive ever tasted. i could eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner. might be one of the things id order for my last meal on earth.the actual meal was good, pretty to look at, but nothing insanely great over another restaurant.definitely worth going.	actually lunch by heston blumenthalthey are capable of turning some of the meat dishes into vegetarian dishes if you were wondering very simply   this place is getting 5 stars because of one very specific thing that i ate  my wife got the strawberry tart dessert  there was a sorbet ice cream with it that was strawberry verbena   one of the best things ive ever tasted  i could eat it for breakfast  lunch  dinner  might be one of the things id order for my last meal on earth the actual meal was good  pretty to look at  but nothing insanely great over another restaurant definitely worth going 
407	5.0	For my first time in London (in the UK at all!) this was an absolutely excellent choice.  My boyfriend and I sat for drinks in the hotel bar for about 30 minutes while we waited for our reservation.  We had read about Dinner and were very excited to experience several things on the menu.  The meat fruit and tipsy cake were exactly as described and very delicious.  I ordered the steak and fries, and although that seems like a simple meal, it was perfect.  Our service was excellent.  The staff was attentive, but left us alone to talk and enjoy our time there.  We were told our menu was a keepsake and we were glad it was, because it will serve as a reminder of our great time, and the interesting take on dinner that Heston Blumenthal portrayed.  Would definitely recommend as a great date place, or simply a place to get a wonderfully crafted meal in a very appropriate atmosphere.	for my first time in london  in the uk at all   this was an absolutely excellent choice   my boyfriend and i sat for drinks in the hotel bar for about 30 minutes while we waited for our reservation   we had read about dinner and were very excited to experience several things on the menu   the meat fruit and tipsy cake were exactly as described and very delicious   i ordered the steak and fries  and although that seems like a simple meal  it was perfect   our service was excellent   the staff was attentive  but left us alone to talk and enjoy our time there   we were told our menu was a keepsake and we were glad it was  because it will serve as a reminder of our great time  and the interesting take on dinner that heston blumenthal portrayed   would definitely recommend as a great date place  or simply a place to get a wonderfully crafted meal in a very appropriate atmosphere 
408	5.0	Dining at Heston Blumenthal's restaurant would make those that ridicule british cuisine ashamed. The service and the food are impeccable. We all had a few questions regarding the entrees, our server explained in detail how our food would be prepared.  The roasted pork belly was succulent. For my entree I has the fillet of beef and pigeon. I never thought I would eat pigeon but the head of our UK operations talked me into it and it was delicious. If I ever get another work related trip to the UK I would without a shadow of a doubt dine at DHB once more.	dining at heston blumenthal s restaurant would make those that ridicule british cuisine ashamed  the service and the food are impeccable  we all had a few questions regarding the entrees  our server explained in detail how our food would be prepared   the roasted pork belly was succulent  for my entree i has the fillet of beef and pigeon  i never thought i would eat pigeon but the head of our uk operations talked me into it and it was delicious  if i ever get another work related trip to the uk i would without a shadow of a doubt dine at dhb once more

410	5.0	Heston, you are a culinary genius. Everything about this meal was perfect. The service was on point, the food was spectacular, the environment was fun. The only thing I did not dig was the jelly fish looking light covers they have on the wall. But that is a minor minor minor detail. Meat Fruit: exceeded my expectations and then some. I've read all these reviews about how the meat fruit was amazing and indeed, it was spectacular. A true work of art. The creamy smooth parfait contrasted with the slight tang of the mandarin skin. How does he do it? I need more grilled bread to spread this goodness on. Other appetizers: I had bites of my friends' roast marrowbone and lobster cucumber soup. The marrowbone was not my favorite, did not like the flavors in it. The lobster soup however was great, huge chucks of lobster. Powdered Duck Breast: I am such a sucker for duck breast, especially when it's done to perfection. Tender, great flavors and not to mention, quite filling. A definite winner in my books. Tipsy Cake: It's like eating sweet delicious clouds. No idea how Heston got the brioche to be so fluffy and light. A must order. I suggest getting a side of ice cream as it goes together perfectly with the warm brioche and spit roasted pineapples. Liquid Nitrogen Ice cream: What can I say, I love liquid nitrogen so of course dessert #2 for me. It's much more of a novelty and a show but so worth it. Top off the cone with some popping candy and it is a party in your mouth. Seriously Heston, Thanks for such a great meal.	heston  you are a culinary genius  everything about this meal was perfect  the service was on point  the food was spectacular  the environment was fun  the only thing i did not dig was the jelly fish looking light covers they have on the wall  but that is a minor minor minor detail  meat fruit  exceeded my expectations and then some  i ve read all these reviews about how the meat fruit was amazing and indeed  it was spectacular  a true work of art  the creamy smooth parfait contrasted with the slight tang of the mandarin skin  how does he do it  i need more grilled bread to spread this goodness on  other appetizers  i had bites of my friends  roast marrowbone and lobster cucumber soup  the marrowbone was not my favorite  did not like the flavors in it  the lobster soup however was great  huge chucks of lobster  powdered duck breast  i am such a sucker for duck breast  especially when it s done to perfection  tender  great flavors and not to mention  quite filling  a definite winner in my books  tipsy cake  it s like eating sweet delicious clouds  no idea how heston got the brioche to be so fluffy and light  a must order  i suggest getting a side of ice cream as it goes together perfectly with the warm brioche and spit roasted pineapples  liquid nitrogen ice cream  what can i say  i love liquid nitrogen so of course dessert  2 for me  it s much more of a novelty and a show but so worth it  top off the cone with some popping candy and it is a party in your mouth  seriously heston  thanks for such a great meal

It's all about wonderful food, friendly service and presentation.I'm involved in Food History, so it was a treat eating those wonderful dishes Heston has created. He used modern techniques with old recipes.  What a treat! My son and I had a fantastic dinner. It was everything we expected it to be. I want to thank your wonderful server who was kind enough to show us around your kitchen.  What a dream. We will return again and again.	dinner is one of my favorite restaurants in london  it s all about wonderful food  friendly service and presentation i m involved in food history  so it was a treat eating those wonderful dishes heston has created  he used modern techniques with old recipes   what a treat  my son and i had a fantastic dinner  it was everything we expected it to be  i want to thank your wonderful server who was kind enough to show us around your kitchen   what a dream  we will return again and again 
413	4.0	Dinner by Heston left us a bit with mixed feelings. The setting is amazing, open kitchen, great decor, overlooking Hyde Park... The service was great, as you would expect from a restaurant of this standing. The food was also very, very good but it somehow felt a bit outdated. The concept is that they take some classical dishes and then put a modern twist on it. That was exactly where maybe our expectations and reality was a bit off. We enjoyed the food, but it missed some excitement. The meatfruit, some paté in the form of a mandarin, is a nice trick but it left us wishing there was more. The snail porridge was very good, that was one of the highlights of the meal. The main courses (we had lamb and roasted pork) were all perfectly executed, but again I would have loved a bit more surprise. The real highlight of the meas were the desserts. Overall a great restaurant and nice experience, but I would have hoped for a bit more excitement, especially since this is Heston Blumenthal. Other restaurants offer more innovative spin on the food.	dinner by heston left us a bit with mixed feelings  the setting is amazing  open kitchen  great decor  overlooking hyde park    the service was great  as you would expect from a restaurant of this standing  the food was also very  very good but it somehow felt a bit outdated  the concept is that they take some classical dishes and then put a modern twist on it  that was exactly where maybe our expectations and reality was a bit off  we enjoyed the food  but it missed some excitement  the meatfruit  some pat  in the form of a mandarin  is a nice trick but it left us wishing there was more  the snail porridge was very good  that was one of the highlights of the meal  the main courses  we had lamb and roasted pork  were all perfectly executed  but again i would have loved a bit more surprise  the real highlight of the meas were the desserts  overall a great restaurant and nice experience  but i would have hoped for a bit more excitement  especially since this is heston blumenthal  other restaurants offer more innovative spin on the food 
414	3.0	I've recently been to Heston's new restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in London. We literally booked months in advance to get a lunch seating not too long after it opened. I may got shot for saying this, but the food was...okay. Don't get my wrong, parts of it were good - but not the amazing I was expecting. Not to mention the extortionate prices. Of course, one must try this restaurant once and I would surely go back for the 'tipsy cake'. The meat fruit (starter) was indeed tasty (who doesn't like a bit of liver?!), and the concept itself, creative but the portion in relation to the bread provided was too much and quite rich for a starter. I'm all for value for money, and obviously scoffed this down. The consistency was just right and the outer 'mandarin' skin really did taste fruity with a hint of citrus that went well and complimented the liver.I had read a review on Yelp which highly recommended the pork chop (as opposed to the Beef Royale) which many raved about. The portion was a good size and the meat was tender (not tough or dry) and well seasoned and cooked. The sauce that accompanied it was tasty from memory, but for the life of me, I can't quite remember if it was salty or citrus-y.Now, the dessert. When I read 'salted caramel' I though 'YES, that is exactly what I want'. I know the 'tipsy cake' had been recommended by others, but I am super sensitive to alcohol, i.e. I can detect it in a slice of tiramisu so I decided to rebel against the consensus. I also don't like the taste of booze so that was that. The waiter warned me my choice was a 'savoury' dessert...yet I still went for it. A mistake. It has this extremely bitter taste and then came the lovely salted caramel as an after taste which was nice. But I just couldn't get over how bitter it was. I think I still ate the whole thing, but not to my enjoyment. The meal ended with an 'earl grey tea' ganache which was to die for, and I did get to sample my sister's 'tipsy cake' which was lovely spitroasted pineapple with the most deletable brioche. I highly recommend it.So was it nice? yes. Was it the amazing I was expecting? Not quite - but nonetheless an experience which must be tried once and perhaps only once.	i ve recently been to heston s new restaurant at the mandarin oriental hotel in london  we literally booked months in advance to get a lunch seating not too long after it opened  i may got shot for saying this  but the food was   okay  don t get my wrong  parts of it were good   but not the amazing i was expecting  not to mention the extortionate prices  of course  one must try this restaurant once and i would surely go back for the  tipsy cake   the meat fruit  starter  was indeed tasty  who doesn t like a bit of liver     and the concept itself  creative but the portion in relation to the bread provided was too much and quite rich for a starter  i m all for value for money  and obviously scoffed this down  the consistency was just right and the outer  mandarin  skin really did taste fruity with a hint of citrus that went well and complimented the liver i had read a review on yelp which highly recommended the pork chop  as opposed to the beef royale  which many raved about  the portion was a good size and the meat was tender  not tough or dry  and well seasoned and cooked  the sauce that accompanied it was tasty from memory  but for the life of me  i can t quite remember if it was salty or citrus y now  the dessert  when i read  salted caramel  i though  yes  that is exactly what i want   i know the  tipsy cake  had been recommended by others  but i am super sensitive to alcohol  i e  i can detect it in a slice of tiramisu so i decided to rebel against the consensus  i also don t like the taste of booze so that was that  the waiter warned me my choice was a  savoury  dessert   yet i still went for it  a mistake  it has this extremely bitter taste and then came the lovely salted caramel as an after taste which was nice  but i just couldn t get over how bitter it was  i think i still ate the whole thing  but not to my enjoyment  the meal ended with an  earl grey tea  ganache which was to die for  and i did get to sample my sister s  tipsy cake  which was lovely spitroasted pineapple with the most deletable brioche  i highly recommend it so was it nice  yes  was it the amazing i was expecting  not quite   but nonetheless an experience which must be tried once and perhaps only once 
415	4.0	I chose to give this place 4 stars because the waiter wasn't the best. Towards the end of the meal he completely disappeared and we ended up having to call over another after we sat for 20 minutes without any water or the check. The service was fine otherwise. For the starter we ordered the meat fruit which is a must. The gelatin didn't really add any taste and the liver was creamy and rich. The waiter brought us some more bread as well, I don't know how you could use the whole thing on just one slice. For my main I got the pork chop which was cooked well and very flavorful. The side of spelt with roberts sauce was also enjoyable. The portion size was large enough to almost fill me up. For desert I had to get the nitrogen ice cream cart. It's definitely not worth the 8.50 or 17.00 because the minimum is 2 but it's one of those experiences I knew I had to have. The cone was the best part, the ice cream and toppings weren't anything special. I would most certainly get a different desert if I was to return. The little chocolate and caraway biscuit they give you at the end is a nice touch, I'm not a fan of caraway seed but the chocolate was very good.	i chose to give this place 4 stars because the waiter wasn t the best  towards the end of the meal he completely disappeared and we ended up having to call over another after we sat for 20 minutes without any water or the check  the service was fine otherwise  for the starter we ordered the meat fruit which is a must  the gelatin didn t really add any taste and the liver was creamy and rich  the waiter brought us some more bread as well  i don t know how you could use the whole thing on just one slice  for my main i got the pork chop which was cooked well and very flavorful  the side of spelt with roberts sauce was also enjoyable  the portion size was large enough to almost fill me up  for desert i had to get the nitrogen ice cream cart  it s definitely not worth the 8 50 or 17 00 because the minimum is 2 but it s one of those experiences i knew i had to have  the cone was the best part  the ice cream and toppings weren t anything special  i would most certainly get a different desert if i was to return  the little chocolate and caraway biscuit they give you at the end is a nice touch  i m not a fan of caraway seed but the chocolate was very good 
416	5.0	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. I think that pretty much say it all. Well, maybe not everything... Over the years I have had some pretty shocking experiences at restaurants owned by famous chefs. And after a series of bad experiences, I must admit, I became a bit jaded. Does a famous owner really mean the restaurant will be great or is it simply a badging exercise to inflate the prices and create a bit of buzz for the hotel it inhabits? Until I visited Dinner by Heston, I was beginning to believe the latter. But Heston, you have changed my mind. It's not cheap and it's quite difficult to get a reservation, but just get over it and put a note in your diary to ring for a reservation (respectively). I stared with the famous Meat Fruit - a fantastic illusion. Yes, it's a pate in the shape, colour and texture of a mandarin orange. There's quite a lot of it, and it's rich as hell, but somehow when you finish, you still want just a bit more. I then moved on to the sweetbreads (i have a thing for sweetbreads). They were amazing - perfectly tender and seasoned. I could not have asked for anything more. I finished with the Brown Bread Ice-cream. I'm not always a huge dessert person so this being a slightly savoury dessert suited me just fine. I can't claim to have studied the wine list. Instead we simply asked the sommeliers for a bit of help. We had a series of fantastic wines - sparkling, white, red and finally a sweet. Finally, the service was absolutely impeccable. Sometimes service can be stiff or overbearing, but this was refreshingly polite yet casual. It was the way modern service should be with mutual respect between diners and wait staff. They were knowledgable and could tell you the history of each dish in great detail (impressive). So along with a lovely dinner, we got a bit of a history lesson - win/win.	yum  yum  yum  yum  yum  i think that pretty much say it all  well  maybe not everything    over the years i have had some pretty shocking experiences at restaurants owned by famous chefs  and after a series of bad experiences  i must admit  i became a bit jaded  does a famous owner really mean the restaurant will be great or is it simply a badging exercise to inflate the prices and create a bit of buzz for the hotel it inhabits  until i visited dinner by heston  i was beginning to believe the latter  but heston  you have changed my mind  it s not cheap and it s quite difficult to get a reservation  but just get over it and put a note in your diary to ring for a reservation  respectively   i stared with the famous meat fruit   a fantastic illusion  yes  it s a pate in the shape  colour and texture of a mandarin orange  there s quite a lot of it  and it s rich as hell  but somehow when you finish  you still want just a bit more  i then moved on to the sweetbreads  i have a thing for sweetbreads   they were amazing   perfectly tender and seasoned  i could not have asked for anything more  i finished with the brown bread ice cream  i m not always a huge dessert person so this being a slightly savoury dessert suited me just fine  i can t claim to have studied the wine list  instead we simply asked the sommeliers for a bit of help  we had a series of fantastic wines   sparkling  white  red and finally a sweet  finally  the service was absolutely impeccable  sometimes service can be stiff or overbearing  but this was refreshingly polite yet casual  it was the way modern service should be with mutual respect between diners and wait staff  they were knowledgable and could tell you the history of each dish in great detail  impressive   so along with a lovely dinner  we got a bit of a history lesson   win win

We ordered the tipsy cake, because of all of the raving reviews, and I will say, none of the reviews make it justice.  It melts in your mouth.

421	5.0	"My perfect Christmas dinner at Bar Boulud held the position of My Best Meal of 2011 for all of two days before being surpassed by tonight's experience at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. The once in a lifetime meal I'd looked forward to for 10 years that I had at Thomas Keller's French Laundry just in January 2011 unbelievably has fallen to a third position. Only three days in London and my expectations have been superseded. Incredibly both Bar Boulud and Dinner by Heston Blumenthal are in the same Mandarin Oriental hotel. Therefore I'm uncertain if I'm taken with London's culinary scene or simply with that of the hotel. ""Dinner"" surpassed Bar Boulud in food, service, and atmosphere. A view of the lit London Eye from our window side table created a romantic setting supported by the softly lit and dark wood dining room.

A bit pricey (£30 - £40 for a main; £15 - £20 for a starter) and thus less of a value than somewhere like Avenue or Vivat Bachhus, it still is a much better experience for the money than Galvin La Chapelle. And you will only spend a bit less around the corner at Buddha Bar, an overpriced, overly trendy, good but not great food, disappointment.I would be more than happy to go to ""Dinner"" again, with friends or colleagues, and especially to celebrate a special occasion or a visitor from the States.

423	5.0	Finished our meal here stuffed full after 3 courses. The portions are not small, let me warn you. Wonderful service by Sarah and her colleagues: friendly, gracious, professional. Food superlative. Meat fruit. Yes, have it. It's very rich, but so silky. We had to try the triple cooked fries, and yes, they were fantastic. Mashed potatoes ditto. Mains ditto. Tipsy cake, ditto. Sommelier helpful, and their wine list has a wide range of pricing. If you have 3 courses, you will likely not have room for their non-menu item -- nitrogen ice cream prepared table-side. We know what to do next time.	finished our meal here stuffed full after 3 courses  the portions are not small  let me warn you  wonderful service by sarah and her colleagues  friendly  gracious  professional  food superlative  meat fruit  yes  have it  it s very rich  but so silky  we had to try the triple cooked fries  and yes  they were fantastic  mashed potatoes ditto  mains ditto  tipsy cake  ditto  sommelier helpful  and their wine list has a wide range of pricing  if you have 3 courses  you will likely not have room for their non menu item    nitrogen ice cream prepared table side  we know what to do next time 
424	5.0	I had high expectations for this restaurant. The evening we spent here did not disappoint.The service was just as you would expect: perfect. The waitress asked us if we had any questions about the dishes.  We gave her a few tricky questions about ingredients, but this just demonstrated how knowledgeable she was about the whole menu.  I learnt that salsify is kind of like a parsnip.There were many dishes which I wanted to try, so I took longer than usual to make up my mind.  I settled on Salamugundy for the starter.  This is a dish of chicken oysters, salsify (!), marrow bone and horseradish cream.  My wife had the roast marrowbone (with snails).  These were both very nice, but not up to the perfect standard I had set in my mind.For the main, I had the Beef Royale (special - not on the menu) which was piece of ribeye which had been cooked for 48 hours, but was still pink and tender.  You could see the marbling of fat, which gave it such a good flavour.  I took my time with this because each bit was something to savour.  My wife chose the Hereford Ribeye, which came with triple-cooked chips and mushroom ketchup.  She was also very pleased with her meal.My wife had ordered the tipsy cake right at the start, as it takes longer to prepare than the other desserts. I had some extra time to consider my choice for desert and I opted for the chocolate bar. Both of these were amazing.  The chocolate bar started with a biscuit base, then a layer of passionfruit jam topped with rich, dark chocolate. It had a quinelle of ginger ice cream on the side. I was lucky to share some of the tipsy cake: kind of a brioche pudding with a creamy sauce (a hint of alcohol) and caramelised roasted pineapple on the side. So, so very nice and I could have happily eaten two of them by myself.  We were given an additional small dessert of chocolate ganache infused with earl grey tea and a biscuit. A nice surprise indeed.We had mentioned that we may get cocktails afterwards and the waiter later offered to reserve a table for us at the bar. I was impressed by this because it showed that he had remembered and was a good personal touch. As it happened, we were satisfied enough after our desserts and decided to head home.	i had high expectations for this restaurant  the evening we spent here did not disappoint the service was just as you would expect  perfect  the waitress asked us if we had any questions about the dishes   we gave her a few tricky questions about ingredients  but this just demonstrated how knowledgeable she was about the whole menu   i learnt that salsify is kind of like a parsnip there were many dishes which i wanted to try  so i took longer than usual to make up my mind   i settled on salamugundy for the starter   this is a dish of chicken oysters  salsify      marrow bone and horseradish cream   my wife had the roast marrowbone  with snails    these were both very nice  but not up to the perfect standard i had set in my mind for the main  i had the beef royale  special   not on the menu  which was piece of ribeye which had been cooked for 48 hours  but was still pink and tender   you could see the marbling of fat  which gave it such a good flavour   i took my time with this because each bit was something to savour   my wife chose the hereford ribeye  which came with triple cooked chips and mushroom ketchup   she was also very pleased with her meal my wife had ordered the tipsy cake right at the start  as it takes longer to prepare than the other desserts  i had some extra time to consider my choice for desert and i opted for the chocolate bar  both of these were amazing   the chocolate bar started with a biscuit base  then a layer of passionfruit jam topped with rich  dark chocolate  it had a quinelle of ginger ice cream on the side  i was lucky to share some of the tipsy cake  kind of a brioche pudding with a creamy sauce  a hint of alcohol  and caramelised roasted pineapple on the side  so  so very nice and i could have happily eaten two of them by myself   we were given an additional small dessert of chocolate ganache infused with earl grey tea and a biscuit  a nice surprise indeed we had mentioned that we may get cocktails afterwards and the waiter later offered to reserve a table for us at the bar  i was impressed by this because it showed that he had remembered and was a good personal touch  as it happened  we were satisfied enough after our desserts and decided to head home 
425	4.0	Had lunch at Dinner. The name is very opportunistic, like a bad first joke to break the ice with a stranger. Despite being in the Mandarin Oriental, the furnishings and ambiance were pleasant and not pretentious.I had the Roast Bonemarrow - solid high-end fare, very savory.Meat Fruit - order it, or at least get one for the table to share. And if you're into foie gras pates, do order one for yourself as well. :)The Tipsy Cake doesn't look impressive when you first see it at that table next to yours, but don't be fooled - it's delicious, and the pineapple-sweet warm softness of it will fill you up and have you craving for more. Be sure to order it early, and order en masse, because it takes quite a while for them to make it.Brown Bread Ice Cream and Quaking Pudding were also very tasty - if you like brown sugar or caramel tastes, these would suit you well. And the Quaking Pudding does indeed quake quite threateningly! All the excuse to quickly slurp it up. :)I would come again.	had lunch at dinner  the name is very opportunistic  like a bad first joke to break the ice with a stranger  despite being in the mandarin oriental  the furnishings and ambiance were pleasant and not pretentious i had the roast bonemarrow   solid high end fare  very savory meat fruit   order it  or at least get one for the table to share  and if you re into foie gras pates  do order one for yourself as well    the tipsy cake doesn t look impressive when you first see it at that table next to yours  but don t be fooled   it s delicious  and the pineapple sweet warm softness of it will fill you up and have you craving for more  be sure to order it early  and order en masse  because it takes quite a while for them to make it brown bread ice cream and quaking pudding were also very tasty   if you like brown sugar or caramel tastes  these would suit you well  and the quaking pudding does indeed quake quite threateningly  all the excuse to quickly slurp it up    i would come again

I had the Hereford ribeye...AMAZING and the triple cooked chips are delicious. If you want a right good food experience this is a must!

427	3.0	"As others have mentioned, the appeal of Dinner has been pronounced by its intro into the ""top 10"" but unfortunately it's simply just a good meal.The Knightsbridge area is very grand and the Mandarin Oriental is classic as one would expect. Our reservation time was upheld as we were even seated a bit early.The waitstaff was excellent through the entire meal however avoided eye contact through most of the serving and ordering processes. Although new to UK dining as I was only in town for a brief time, Dinner to me feels like the little kid who gets a chance to play in the big game but never expected to play so didn't bring his bat. I hope it does well for years to come but left a little bit of a yawn for this Yelper. Overall, the main dishes were good but nothing extremely memorable. The Tipsy Cake was the highlight of the occasion as it was TDF. A great wine tied everything together, however, I couldn't recommend a trip simply as I've had equal quality steak elsewhere.The meal:Rice and Flesh (Risotto w Calf's tail)Filet angusGreen BeansPork chopBraised lettuce w peasTipsy cakeGanacheS.African red wine"	as others have mentioned  the appeal of dinner has been pronounced by its intro into the  top 10  but unfortunately it s simply just a good meal the knightsbridge area is very grand and the mandarin oriental is classic as one would expect  our reservation time was upheld as we were even seated a bit early the waitstaff was excellent through the entire meal however avoided eye contact through most of the serving and ordering processes  although new to uk dining as i was only in town for a brief time  dinner to me feels like the little kid who gets a chance to play in the big game but never expected to play so didn t bring his bat  i hope it does well for years to come but left a little bit of a yawn for this yelper  overall  the main dishes were good but nothing extremely memorable  the tipsy cake was the highlight of the occasion as it was tdf  a great wine tied everything together  however  i couldn t recommend a trip simply as i ve had equal quality steak elsewhere the meal rice and flesh  risotto w calf s tail filet angusgreen beanspork chopbraised lettuce w peastipsy cakeganaches african red wine
428	5.0	Dinner. Well, let's say lunch at Dinner. It was a special occasion, so we booked the Chef's Table. Here's a hint: If you have from four to six people and want an amazing experience, book the Chef's Table. It's much more expensive than the regular menu (£150pp for lunch, £200pp for dinner), but the experience is like none other. They offer three levels of wine pairings as well, which will add anywhere from £100pp-£500pp to the bill, but when you leave you're going to be drunk anyway, so who cares. It's also a tasting menu instead of the standard a la carte, so there's a reason to go for it. You're also sitting right next to the kitchen so you can see what they're doing. They also give have someone that's around quite a bit to explain the history of the food and fill your glasses on the way, so you feel like you're getting special service. Plus Chef Dale (one of the sous-chefs) came by to explain most of the dishes to us, and to show us the Cthulhu fruit (or as some like to call it: Buddha's Hand). So the experience is worth the money itself.What about the food? The food is pretty great as well. Like I said, it was a nine-course tasting menu which for us (as they prepare it on the day, so who knows what you're getting) consisted of tea-smoked salmon, lobster with cucumber soup, meat fruit, octopus with Cthulhu fruit, pork belly, pigeon, grilled peaches, tipsy cake, and liquid nitrogen ice cream. What a selection. All the food is prepared extremely well and looks amazing on the plate. For me there were three stand-out dishes:1) Octopus with Cthulhu fruit. That octopus was so soft and tender that you could probably cut it with a spoon. And the taste was heavenly. And if Buddha really is Cthulhu, he makes a mean citrus fruit. I was blown away by the flavors on that plate.2) Tipsy cake. The cake itself is heavenly, but the pineapple really won my heart. Apparently there's a cookbook coming out soon (or will be out by the time you've read this, who knows?) and it will have the recipe in it. I'm getting it.3) The mash. The mash is freaking amazing. It is so creamy and so soft and buttery and smooth we had to ask for more. MORE MORE MORE MASH. I even got the secrets to how it's made, and they are all mine! (Although if you go to the Chef's table, I'm sure you can find out yourself. Or maybe they'll be in the cookbook.) I will be attempting the mash at home very, very soon.Now, I bet you were expecting that I put the meat fruit in here. To be honest, it was cool. It looked like an orange, but it was pate! How very Heston! The pate was nice, but I've had better to be honest. I did enjoy the taste of the bread with it. It really complimented it.Another tip: If you're looking for triple-cooked chips, don't go in August/September. Andrew tried to order some, but they were out, and apparently they were out at the same time last year when they went. Apparently potatoes in August/September have more sugar than later in the year, so the triple-cook method creates subpar chips. So they don't make them. It was an interesting thing to know.We even got a preview of some chefs filling the molds for the meat fruit. We were sitting right around the corner, so we got to get up and stand there and watch them do it, and I learned a bit about how it's done (But I'm sure the recipe will be in the cookbook.)Oh, and if you get there early, sit in the bar and have some cocktails. They aren't cheap (at £16 a drink), but they are the best cocktails I've had in London so far.For me, the chef's table at dinner was one of the best experiences and most fun I've had at a fine dining restaurant in London so far. The food here is less funky than The Fat Duck, and more historical, which makes it interesting in a completely different way. I'm not too sure I'll be back to eat again, as I got a nice selection, and the food overall didn't wow me enough like some fine dining places, but I'd come back to the bar for more of those delicious cocktails. Or maybe I'd come back with a big group and go for the private dining room. That seemed like an experience in itself as well.	dinner  well  let s say lunch at dinner  it was a special occasion  so we booked the chef s table  here s a hint  if you have from four to six people and want an amazing experience  book the chef s table  it s much more expensive than the regular menu   150pp for lunch   200pp for dinner   but the experience is like none other  they offer three levels of wine pairings as well  which will add anywhere from  100pp  500pp to the bill  but when you leave you re going to be drunk anyway  so who cares  it s also a tasting menu instead of the standard a la carte  so there s a reason to go for it  you re also sitting right next to the kitchen so you can see what they re doing  they also give have someone that s around quite a bit to explain the history of the food and fill your glasses on the way  so you feel like you re getting special service  plus chef dale  one of the sous chefs  came by to explain most of the dishes to us  and to show us the cthulhu fruit  or as some like to call it  buddha s hand   so the experience is worth the money itself what about the food  the food is pretty great as well  like i said  it was a nine course tasting menu which for us  as they prepare it on the day  so who knows what you re getting  consisted of tea smoked salmon  lobster with cucumber soup  meat fruit  octopus with cthulhu fruit  pork belly  pigeon  grilled peaches  tipsy cake  and liquid nitrogen ice cream  what a selection  all the food is prepared extremely well and looks amazing on the plate  for me there were three stand out dishes 1  octopus with cthulhu fruit  that octopus was so soft and tender that you could probably cut it with a spoon  and the taste was heavenly  and if buddha really is cthulhu  he makes a mean citrus fruit  i was blown away by the flavors on that plate 2  tipsy cake  the cake itself is heavenly  but the pineapple really won my heart  apparently there s a cookbook coming out soon  or will be out by the time you ve read this  who knows   and it will have the recipe in it  i m getting it 3  the mash  the mash is freaking amazing  it is so creamy and so soft and buttery and smooth we had to ask for more  more more more mash  i even got the secrets to how it s made  and they are all mine   although if you go to the chef s table  i m sure you can find out yourself  or maybe they ll be in the cookbook   i will be attempting the mash at home very  very soon now  i bet you were expecting that i put the meat fruit in here  to be honest  it was cool  it looked like an orange  but it was pate  how very heston  the pate was nice  but i ve had better to be honest  i did enjoy the taste of the bread with it  it really complimented it another tip  if you re looking for triple cooked chips  don t go in august september  andrew tried to order some  but they were out  and apparently they were out at the same time last year when they went  apparently potatoes in august september have more sugar than later in the year  so the triple cook method creates subpar chips  so they don t make them  it was an interesting thing to know we even got a preview of some chefs filling the molds for the meat fruit  we were sitting right around the corner  so we got to get up and stand there and watch them do it  and i learned a bit about how it s done  but i m sure the recipe will be in the cookbook  oh  and if you get there early  sit in the bar and have some cocktails  they aren t cheap  at  16 a drink   but they are the best cocktails i ve had in london so far for me  the chef s table at dinner was one of the best experiences and most fun i ve had at a fine dining restaurant in london so far  the food here is less funky than the fat duck  and more historical  which makes it interesting in a completely different way  i m not too sure i ll be back to eat again  as i got a nice selection  and the food overall didn t wow me enough like some fine dining places  but i d come back to the bar for more of those delicious cocktails  or maybe i d come back with a big group and go for the private dining room  that seemed like an experience in itself as well

Setting is beautiful as always with high ceiling and good spaces between seats and lovely view from the window. Try to ask for seats by the window. Food is innovative and tasty. Don't go for its signature dessert of pineapple brioche and liquid nitrogen ice cream - they are really nothing special... Good solid good otherwise . Service is always slightly off with many young staffs waiting table - but enjoyable nevertheless.	was there for lunch this time    it was great  i asked for a seat by the window and we both had a lunch menu with side of near and fruit  setting is beautiful as always with high ceiling and good spaces between seats and lovely view from the window  try to ask for seats by the window  food is innovative and tasty  don t go for its signature dessert of pineapple brioche and liquid nitrogen ice cream   they are really nothing special    good solid good otherwise   service is always slightly off with many young staffs waiting table   but enjoyable nevertheless 
430	4.0	I very much enjoyed dinner at Dinner. The food was very good, and the service was solid, but not outstanding.I had a bit of a tough time finding a starter that was appealing to me, and the lack of vegetarian options was a little frustrating. I know the Meaty Fruit is the most popular, but I can't bring myself to support that dish. That being said, the main of cod was outstanding and complemented wonderfully by the smoke artichokes -- excellent. I had the brown bread ice cream for dessert and was not at all disappointed. This was a great dinner, and atmosphere was not uptight like I thought it might be. While (unconditionally) expensive, I thought it was pretty reasonably priced.	i very much enjoyed dinner at dinner  the food was very good  and the service was solid  but not outstanding i had a bit of a tough time finding a starter that was appealing to me  and the lack of vegetarian options was a little frustrating  i know the meaty fruit is the most popular  but i can t bring myself to support that dish  that being said  the main of cod was outstanding and complemented wonderfully by the smoke artichokes    excellent  i had the brown bread ice cream for dessert and was not at all disappointed  this was a great dinner  and atmosphere was not uptight like i thought it might be  while  unconditionally  expensive  i thought it was pretty reasonably priced 
431	5.0	I've been 3 times and thoroughly enjoyed it each time!! I would definitely recommend the meat fruit to start. as it is quite rich, you could easily share it with someone (if you're not greedy like me)! I absolutely loved the pigeon and of course, it's all about the tipsy cake for dessert. It's elegant but relaxed and a truly memorable dining experience.	i ve been 3 times and thoroughly enjoyed it each time   i would definitely recommend the meat fruit to start  as it is quite rich  you could easily share it with someone  if you re not greedy like me   i absolutely loved the pigeon and of course  it s all about the tipsy cake for dessert  it s elegant but relaxed and a truly memorable dining experience 
432	5.0	I had been looking forward to this lunch since we booked before Christmas and it delivered on all fronts. Three courses with Heston and Ashley will take you to foodie heaven, put a big smile on your face and oh so gently remove a couple of hundred pounds from your wallet. Given the acres of coverage online and in the press I don't think that there is much for me to add. If you want to keep it cheapish tap water is available and the set menu of 3 courses for £28 is a bargain. If you look hard there are a few bottles of wine under £40 and there is a decent selection by the glass. The meat fruit starter is just divine; a picture on the plate, it melted in the mouth and was like a lighter version of foie gras. B went for the roast scallops which came with a cucumber ketchup and borage; quite different and very tasty. We washed this down with a bottle of the white Il Cantante, Etna which was crisp, fragrant and complex - not a great fan of Simply Red but Mr Hucknall is turning out some great wine. I also had a glass of a rich robust red; the Tributo, Tejo 2008 which I would recommend very highly. Main courses and desserts were all top notch; not many people have mentioned the fish but B's roast turbot with cockle ketchup and leaf chicory was damn fine. If all cockles tasted like this I would be giving up the clam tomorrow. More bread, not made in the kitchen but bought in, was offered when we had scoffed our initial offering. Service was attentive but not over-bearing; if you enquired about a dish or a wine the staff knew their stuff and could talk at length and with insight. The room is well thought out; the tables are nicely presented and well-spaced. Wherever you are seated you will have a good view of the room, the kitchen or the park; if you are lucky you will have a combination of all three. It reminded me of one of my all time favourites: Jean Georges next to Central Park. Just one strange thing caught my eye during our lunch which I mentioned to B and she concurred with my observation. The trousers worn by the lovely lady waiting staff are just not cut right; I have never seen so much VPL in one sitting. Heston himself was buzzing about during the few hours we were there but I would think he is much too focused on the food at the moment to have given much attention to the look of his ladies front of house. Hopefully he will soon be turning his attention to these small details. We left around 5pm slightly heavy around the middle but light of heart and with a happy disposition as we made our way through the crowds down to Green Park and the short hop home. Having got this fine dining malarkey out of the way for the year I'm looking forward to getting back down to earth in New Cross tomorrow night at Meateasy .	i had been looking forward to this lunch since we booked before christmas and it delivered on all fronts  three courses with heston and ashley will take you to foodie heaven  put a big smile on your face and oh so gently remove a couple of hundred pounds from your wallet  given the acres of coverage online and in the press i don t think that there is much for me to add  if you want to keep it cheapish tap water is available and the set menu of 3 courses for  28 is a bargain  if you look hard there are a few bottles of wine under  40 and there is a decent selection by the glass  the meat fruit starter is just divine  a picture on the plate  it melted in the mouth and was like a lighter version of foie gras  b went for the roast scallops which came with a cucumber ketchup and borage  quite different and very tasty  we washed this down with a bottle of the white il cantante  etna which was crisp  fragrant and complex   not a great fan of simply red but mr hucknall is turning out some great wine  i also had a glass of a rich robust red  the tributo  tejo 2008 which i would recommend very highly  main courses and desserts were all top notch  not many people have mentioned the fish but b s roast turbot with cockle ketchup and leaf chicory was damn fine  if all cockles tasted like this i would be giving up the clam tomorrow  more bread  not made in the kitchen but bought in  was offered when we had scoffed our initial offering  service was attentive but not over bearing  if you enquired about a dish or a wine the staff knew their stuff and could talk at length and with insight  the room is well thought out  the tables are nicely presented and well spaced  wherever you are seated you will have a good view of the room  the kitchen or the park  if you are lucky you will have a combination of all three  it reminded me of one of my all time favourites  jean georges next to central park  just one strange thing caught my eye during our lunch which i mentioned to b and she concurred with my observation  the trousers worn by the lovely lady waiting staff are just not cut right  i have never seen so much vpl in one sitting  heston himself was buzzing about during the few hours we were there but i would think he is much too focused on the food at the moment to have given much attention to the look of his ladies front of house  hopefully he will soon be turning his attention to these small details  we left around 5pm slightly heavy around the middle but light of heart and with a happy disposition as we made our way through the crowds down to green park and the short hop home  having got this fine dining malarkey out of the way for the year i m looking forward to getting back down to earth in new cross tomorrow night at meateasy  
433	4.0	Really enjoyable dinner experience. Let's start with the biggest and most positive surprise. The waitstaff. Very attentive but really fun and nice. The food is immaculate. Heston certainly knows how to pull of a great steak for instance. and the cod in cider was perfect as well.The only thing I didnt get was the sides. Just ordering random sides makes it an average steak house experience. I would have wished to get a more conceptualized food experience around the steak.Well, and then we got the desserts. Amazing. Both, the dark bread ice cream but especially the tipsy cake. a winner.	really enjoyable dinner experience  let s start with the biggest and most positive surprise  the waitstaff  very attentive but really fun and nice  the food is immaculate  heston certainly knows how to pull of a great steak for instance  and the cod in cider was perfect as well the only thing i didnt get was the sides  just ordering random sides makes it an average steak house experience  i would have wished to get a more conceptualized food experience around the steak well  and then we got the desserts  amazing  both  the dark bread ice cream but especially the tipsy cake  a winner

437	5.0	This is one of the best restaurants I have been to in London! The service was amazing and everything I ate was superb. For an appetizer, I recommend the meat feast. It comes disguised as an orange and is one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten. Also, ask about the ice cream made with liquid nitrogen. It really is something watching them make it in front of you.	this is one of the best restaurants i have been to in london  the service was amazing and everything i ate was superb  for an appetizer  i recommend the meat feast  it comes disguised as an orange and is one of the best appetizers i have ever eaten  also  ask about the ice cream made with liquid nitrogen  it really is something watching them make it in front of you 
438	5.0	From the moment I stepped into the Mandarin Oriental for lunch at Dinner I felt like an honored guest, and this was even before stepping into the restaurant. The restaurant is light, the servers are polite and welcoming. And the food . . . I loved every bite of what I had. The Earl Grey Tea cured Salmon for a starter was fresh and complex. The Spiced Pigeon was rich and delicious. The Tipsy Cake was beyond. The Pinot Noir and Japanese tea I had were perfect accompaniments. Yes, it's expensive, but at least you get what you pay for; a great food experience with great service.	from the moment i stepped into the mandarin oriental for lunch at dinner i felt like an honored guest  and this was even before stepping into the restaurant  the restaurant is light  the servers are polite and welcoming  and the food       i loved every bite of what i had  the earl grey tea cured salmon for a starter was fresh and complex  the spiced pigeon was rich and delicious  the tipsy cake was beyond  the pinot noir and japanese tea i had were perfect accompaniments  yes  it s expensive  but at least you get what you pay for  a great food experience with great service 
439	5.0	Truly do listen to the other recommendations: order the meat fruit. Its absolutely amazing. My wife ordered roasted scallops which were also quite amazing, but the meat fruit stole the show for me. For mains, I had the powdered duck breast and my wife had the roast iberico pork chop. Both were fantastic. The mashed potatoes are an especially good side order. The duck was exceptionally tender and flavorful. I had the tipsy cake and my wife had the sambocade for dessert. Tipsy cake is quite great, but I was equally as impressed with the sambocade. Truly tasty desserts. Chocolate ganoche ended the meal.  This was also quite tasty, although if you don't like chocolate this won't be the dish for you. The service was just as good as the food. It was exceptional.

441	3.0	Obviously, the best thing on their menu is their famed meat fruit. Mandarin gelee with foie gras on the inside. It looks like a regular orange, which is gimmicky but part of the charm. The restaurant is really beautiful so you gotta give them credit for presenting such an awesome decor to dine in. Other than the meat fruit, I honestly forgot what else I ate there because it wasn't too memorable. But the meat fruit lives up to the hype.	obviously  the best thing on their menu is their famed meat fruit  mandarin gelee with foie gras on the inside  it looks like a regular orange  which is gimmicky but part of the charm  the restaurant is really beautiful so you gotta give them credit for presenting such an awesome decor to dine in  other than the meat fruit  i honestly forgot what else i ate there because it wasn t too memorable  but the meat fruit lives up to the hype 
442	5.0	This will not be a rave review. Nor a ranty review. This will be a simple, non-poncy, maybe slightly pedantic, review of a restaurant that is a paradigm of good service and an excellent kitchen.The restaurant itself is beautiful, simple, airy, with very high ceilings (the way ceilings should be) and despite being in the middle of London, somehow, somewhere, it has found a garden, or a park, or just a clustering of grass, bushes and trees to have outside some magnificent bay windows. I sat facing them on the longest day of the year, the sun shining in and onto my table. Idyllic.The menu was simple, and wrapped around it was a small piece of cardboard which shouldn't go unnoticed. Open it up. And read. And learn some piece of trivia.As I said, service was excellent. Water was refilled, questions asked and answered at the right time and the right tone and mood. Everything was perfect. Then. The food came. And made me giggle. The chicken liver parfait is shaped like a mandarine! I thought oh, how cute, we're in the Mandarin Oriental! (hotel) It was also delicious. And for the first time in a very long time (definitely the first time in England  the english being notoriously stingy on water and bread- and not always a lucky occurrence in France) I had plenty of bread to eat nearly all of my pate! Looooved it!Next up: Steak. Rump steak. YUM! But you see the most delicious part of the dish wasn't the meat. Oh the irony. It was of course the chips!! Heston truly has mastered the art of the french fry. Well done. Thank you. Now if my choices were wider than Dinner by Heston at the Mandarin Oriental vs. Frites Antoine in Brussels' Place Jourdan, I would be one happy (if slightly heftier) bunny!As for dessert I got the giggles again. Their signature dessert is called Tipsy cake. How inimitable. Had someone actually called it that back in 1810? Apparently so. Now all I need is to secure myself a copy of that cookery book and I will be able to have that delicious, divine, spongy brioche dribbling with delicate sweetness, hot from the oven, at my heart's content. And probably to the delight of any of my friends (and partner) willing to trek all the way to Woking for it. Will come out to Surrey for Tipsy cake. Yes. Well I came in from Surrey for it. And I damn well would again!!	this will not be a rave review  nor a ranty review  this will be a simple  non poncy  maybe slightly pedantic  review of a restaurant that is a paradigm of good service and an excellent kitchen the restaurant itself is beautiful  simple  airy  with very high ceilings  the way ceilings should be  and despite being in the middle of london  somehow  somewhere  it has found a garden  or a park  or just a clustering of grass  bushes and trees to have outside some magnificent bay windows  i sat facing them on the longest day of the year  the sun shining in and onto my table  idyllic the menu was simple  and wrapped around it was a small piece of cardboard which shouldn t go unnoticed  open it up  and read  and learn some piece of trivia as i said  service was excellent  water was refilled  questions asked and answered at the right time and the right tone and mood  everything was perfect  then  the food came  and made me giggle  the chicken liver parfait is shaped like a mandarine  i thought oh  how cute  we re in the mandarin oriental   hotel  it was also delicious  and for the first time in a very long time  definitely the first time in england  the english being notoriously stingy on water and bread  and not always a lucky occurrence in france  i had plenty of bread to eat nearly all of my pate  looooved it next up  steak  rump steak  yum  but you see the most delicious part of the dish wasn t the meat  oh the irony  it was of course the chips   heston truly has mastered the art of the french fry  well done  thank you  now if my choices were wider than dinner by heston at the mandarin oriental vs  frites antoine in brussels  place jourdan  i would be one happy  if slightly heftier  bunny as for dessert i got the giggles again  their signature dessert is called tipsy cake  how inimitable  had someone actually called it that back in 1810  apparently so  now all i need is to secure myself a copy of that cookery book and i will be able to have that delicious  divine  spongy brioche dribbling with delicate sweetness  hot from the oven  at my heart s content  and probably to the delight of any of my friends  and partner  willing to trek all the way to woking for it  will come out to surrey for tipsy cake  yes  well i came in from surrey for it  and i damn well would again  
443	3.0	We came with high expectations and were sorely disappointed. The bar in Mandarin had beautiful drinks and the glasses were stunning. It's certainly worth visiting and having a drink or two. However, upon entering the dining hall at 7.30 we felt like we had walked into lunch hour. For being a 5 star Michelin restaurant, the dress code was causal. We felt overdressed! We paid £900 for dinner for four persons and I feel like the food was decent and extremely overpriced. We ordered the meat fruit which was amazing, the best dish in the restaurant. However, the ribeye was terrible, it was thin and nothing to write home about. My partner ordered the pigeon and it was okay. The table enjoyed tipsy cake and said it was very good. If you are looking for an amazing wine list, look no further. You will enjoy being well attended by knowledgable staff. The location is amazing, there is no place like Hyde Park and Knightsbridge high street.	we came with high expectations and were sorely disappointed  the bar in mandarin had beautiful drinks and the glasses were stunning  it s certainly worth visiting and having a drink or two  however  upon entering the dining hall at 7 30 we felt like we had walked into lunch hour  for being a 5 star michelin restaurant  the dress code was causal  we felt overdressed  we paid  900 for dinner for four persons and i feel like the food was decent and extremely overpriced  we ordered the meat fruit which was amazing  the best dish in the restaurant  however  the ribeye was terrible  it was thin and nothing to write home about  my partner ordered the pigeon and it was okay  the table enjoyed tipsy cake and said it was very good  if you are looking for an amazing wine list  look no further  you will enjoy being well attended by knowledgable staff  the location is amazing  there is no place like hyde park and knightsbridge high street 
444	4.0	"We had a good friend coming into town and wanted a special evening out.  With all of the hype in the NYT, Heston Blumenthal seemed like an obvious choice.  Well, that is until we call to make a reservation.  We dined at Heston Blumenthal in early May.  However, when I called the reservation line, the answer phone stated that they were all booked until August....""if you'd like to make a reservation in September, please hold the line.""Luckily, our friend has an American Express Centurion card and was able to call and get an exclusive reservation.After all of the hoopla of getting a reservation, our expectations for dinner were already pretty high.Ok - onto the experience:We started the evening by ordering a very nice bottle of White Burgundy from Puligny-Montrachet.  I have to say that the wine list is much better in person - and there is a lot missing from their website.  The list was quite good and you could also see a good majority of the temperature-controlled wine celler from the main dining area.As I'm sure most do, I ordered the meat fruit (c. 1500) for my first course. It was a chicken liver parfait which was served in the shape of  Mandarin.  Very clever - and equally as tasty!  For my second course, I had the Roast Turbot (c. 1830).  This white fish was prepared perfectly and served with cockle ketchup and chicory leaves.  For dessert, I had the Tipsy cake (c.1810).  Really, there is only one word to describe this:  INCREDIBLE!  Probably the best dessert that I've ever had at a restaurant.  The Tipsy Cake is a buttery cake that is served with a spit roast pineapple which had been roasting for minimum of 4 hours.  This was the talk of our meal!Overall, we had a really nice dining experience and good service.  Heston Blumenthal, regardless of the Fat Duck connection, is a fantastic spot for a very nice meal.  The meal was expensive, but worth it for a special treat."	we had a good friend coming into town and wanted a special evening out   with all of the hype in the nyt  heston blumenthal seemed like an obvious choice   well  that is until we call to make a reservation   we dined at heston blumenthal in early may   however  when i called the reservation line  the answer phone stated that they were all booked until august     if you d like to make a reservation in september  please hold the line  luckily  our friend has an american express centurion card and was able to call and get an exclusive reservation after all of the hoopla of getting a reservation  our expectations for dinner were already pretty high ok   onto the experience we started the evening by ordering a very nice bottle of white burgundy from puligny montrachet   i have to say that the wine list is much better in person   and there is a lot missing from their website   the list was quite good and you could also see a good majority of the temperature controlled wine celler from the main dining area as i m sure most do  i ordered the meat fruit  c  1500  for my first course  it was a chicken liver parfait which was served in the shape of  mandarin   very clever   and equally as tasty   for my second course  i had the roast turbot  c  1830    this white fish was prepared perfectly and served with cockle ketchup and chicory leaves   for dessert  i had the tipsy cake  c 1810    really  there is only one word to describe this   incredible   probably the best dessert that i ve ever had at a restaurant   the tipsy cake is a buttery cake that is served with a spit roast pineapple which had been roasting for minimum of 4 hours   this was the talk of our meal overall  we had a really nice dining experience and good service   heston blumenthal  regardless of the fat duck connection  is a fantastic spot for a very nice meal   the meal was expensive  but worth it for a special treat 
445	5.0	I have been here three times now and I hope to be back soon.Service: I have had the same waiter,  I believe his name is John-Lucca, every time and I am certain the management staff planned that on purpose. We love him! We also love the rest of the staff, every one of them has been trained to a high standard and it shows. Not only are they highly professional but they're also incredibly nice and fun to chat to. Food: The food is phenomenal. I had never been to one of Heston's restaurants before but I am now a loyal fan. I love how inventive his dishes are. I think the idea behind Dinner has really worked well with Heston taking what was surely a so-so dish favorited however many years ago by this king or that queen and recreated it so that it is something fantastic and applicable to this day and age.  The presentation is always something special as well.  The Meatfruit is the most delicious pate I have ever tasted.  In terms of the mains I love the duck and the steak in particular and all of the desserts are worth trying but especially the ice cream, which is not to be missed.Value: I would rather spend £100 pounds at Dinner than £20 at some other sub-par restaurant.  Eating out should always be treated as a special occasion and therefore as a diner, one should always aim to eat somewhere different and special.  Dinner is definitely different and is absolutely worth every penny because it's so special .  I cannot recommend it enough.	i have been here three times now and i hope to be back soon service  i have had the same waiter   i believe his name is john lucca  every time and i am certain the management staff planned that on purpose  we love him  we also love the rest of the staff  every one of them has been trained to a high standard and it shows  not only are they highly professional but they re also incredibly nice and fun to chat to  food  the food is phenomenal  i had never been to one of heston s restaurants before but i am now a loyal fan  i love how inventive his dishes are  i think the idea behind dinner has really worked well with heston taking what was surely a so so dish favorited however many years ago by this king or that queen and recreated it so that it is something fantastic and applicable to this day and age   the presentation is always something special as well   the meatfruit is the most delicious pate i have ever tasted   in terms of the mains i love the duck and the steak in particular and all of the desserts are worth trying but especially the ice cream  which is not to be missed value  i would rather spend  100 pounds at dinner than  20 at some other sub par restaurant   eating out should always be treated as a special occasion and therefore as a diner  one should always aim to eat somewhere different and special   dinner is definitely different and is absolutely worth every penny because it s so special    i cannot recommend it enough

We started the evening with a drink at the hotel's bar. As soon as our table was ready we were taken through, where our first waiter greeted my mum with a ""I hear we're celebrating your special birthday this evening?"" which was a lovely touch. From then on, everything was a blur. The incredible wine list, attentive friendly knowledgable service, the beautiful decor... that's all before mentioning the food! As a peskitarian I often dread meals out, fearing I'd be left with the booby-food prize. But with delicious Scallops and cucumber ketchup followed my the best cod and mussles I'd ever eaten I was in food heaven. I then opted for brown bread ice cream, which was devine. Finally, we were given complimentary Earl Gray ganache for my mum's birthday, served by the Maitre D, who also wished my mum a very happy birthday. Heston - your staff and chef's did you proud - they made for a memorable, special evening in fabulous surroundings.

451	5.0	Lunch here was one of the best meals of my life, period. The meat fruit is amazingly tasty and gorgeous, and the pork chop was the best I have ever had. It came with a rather interesting and unique combination of sides as well that are better experienced than described. The meat was cooked to perfection. The Tipsy Cake for dessert was awesome. The brioche was warm and moist, and the pineapple gave it just the right kick.The only thing I would change is that the salted caramel ice cream dessert was just a tad too sweet, but it was still enjoyable. I miss this place already. I don't understand how this has a four-star average on Yelp at this time when one compares with the ratings of Le Gavroche (which I strongly recommend skipping) and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (which is fine but nothing like this). Heston Blumenthal is a culinary genius, and I take my hat off.	lunch here was one of the best meals of my life  period  the meat fruit is amazingly tasty and gorgeous  and the pork chop was the best i have ever had  it came with a rather interesting and unique combination of sides as well that are better experienced than described  the meat was cooked to perfection  the tipsy cake for dessert was awesome  the brioche was warm and moist  and the pineapple gave it just the right kick the only thing i would change is that the salted caramel ice cream dessert was just a tad too sweet  but it was still enjoyable  i miss this place already  i don t understand how this has a four star average on yelp at this time when one compares with the ratings of le gavroche  which i strongly recommend skipping  and l atelier de joel robuchon  which is fine but nothing like this   heston blumenthal is a culinary genius  and i take my hat off

453	3.0	nya-nya-nya-nya...nya.We got in to Dinner at Heston's on a Saturday night and if I wasn't such a nice bloke I would have been gloating all day Fri after my partner let me know this is where we were going for my birthday.Such excitement.Black cab down there. Boys in red opening the door. All good. Into the grand place and straight to the bar for a livener.The bar was a little unspectacular to be honest and the drinks took an age so we wandered into the dining room with them.Staff very welcoming, room very comfy, not too formal which is always my fear with hotel dining. Nice jelly moulds on the wall. Tables spacious. Menu wonderful. Lots of old english classics from the 1600s etc and a little literature on their history. This is a real occasion and if you're bothered about all that, very interesting.The bread came and was rather a disappointment though. Four slices of sort of toasted bread which was far too brittle to be pleasant in the mouth. The kind of stuff that scratches the roof of the mouth and leaves you rather sore. And frankly the taste wasn't up to much if you like your bread sour as well as chewy. Oh well!For starter I ordered Salamugundy which sounds like a Bond villain but is actually the 'oysters' of the chicken - those bits at the bottom of the carcass you dig out that nobody else is greedy enough to find. I love 'em and thought I was the only one who knew the secret. But clearly Heston does.The missus ordered hay smoked mackerel. My salamugundy was as pretty as a picture when it came, decorated with chicory leaves that looked like devil's horns. The blobs of marrow bone were beautifully decorated with crunchy breadcrumbs. The whole thing was a solid effort taste wise. The mackerel was delicious. Small bannetons of the fish, beautifully trimmed and gently cooked. You could have mistaken it for being raw but something had gone on and the texture was great.For mains I ordered roast halibut with cockle ketchup. The missus ordered fillet steak and chips.Halibut is an amazing fish. But once it's overdone it becomes dense and a bit of a dry mouthful. Guess what? Mine was overdone. What a crying shame. The cockle sauce was divine. It really was. But the bit I was craving was just a dense block. Gutted. Me, not the fish, you understand.The missus ordered her fillet steak medium so got what she deserved when it came out exactly like she had asked for it. I could tell that it used to be a wonderful piece of meat. The chips however were, again, a let down. Triple cooked? If that's what happens to them when they are triple cooked I'd prefer the double or single cooked version every time. They were leathery and not fluffy inside like chips should be. I reckon they had been left for a long while out of the fryer, that's how they came across anyhow. There was a mushroom ketchup which was good and the gravy that came in a small jug was delicious.But I have to say, there were a few things with the meal that really disappointed. You don't expect to go to a place with such a reputation and get your main course halibut overcooked. You don't expect the chips to be leathery. And you don't expect the bread to be so crunchy as to make it almost wholly unmanageable once the teeth have cracked it into the mouth. I felt like Monsieur Mange Tout, that circus bloke who ate glass and things when I was a kid. As I said there were real highlights to the cooking but these things really brought it down. A real shame as the service was delightful. A lovely chatty sommelier who had all the time in the world for an old ignoramus like me. And a young waiter only too keen to let us know any detail we wanted about the food.We came for an amazing experience but left feeling slightly disappointed and short changed. We spent over £200 and only had one bottle of wine and for that money you'd expect something approaching perfection. We deffo didn't get that. In fact, I'd call it a little careless. The problems were all wholly avoidable with a bit more care and attention.Ah well. You win some you lose some.We chatted together about places we had been to that had been as extravagant but simply better and came up with a good list. And thought of a fair few that were better and a lot cheaper too.I must say though, I got food envy when I saw the couple next to us tucking into their meat fruit starter. It looked great! Shame we won't be rushing back to try it.	nya nya nya nya   nya we got in to dinner at heston s on a saturday night and if i wasn t such a nice bloke i would have been gloating all day fri after my partner let me know this is where we were going for my birthday such excitement black cab down there  boys in red opening the door  all good  into the grand place and straight to the bar for a livener the bar was a little unspectacular to be honest and the drinks took an age so we wandered into the dining room with them staff very welcoming  room very comfy  not too formal which is always my fear with hotel dining  nice jelly moulds on the wall  tables spacious  menu wonderful  lots of old english classics from the 1600s etc and a little literature on their history  this is a real occasion and if you re bothered about all that  very interesting the bread came and was rather a disappointment though  four slices of sort of toasted bread which was far too brittle to be pleasant in the mouth  the kind of stuff that scratches the roof of the mouth and leaves you rather sore  and frankly the taste wasn t up to much if you like your bread sour as well as chewy  oh well for starter i ordered salamugundy which sounds like a bond villain but is actually the  oysters  of the chicken   those bits at the bottom of the carcass you dig out that nobody else is greedy enough to find  i love  em and thought i was the only one who knew the secret  but clearly heston does the missus ordered hay smoked mackerel  my salamugundy was as pretty as a picture when it came  decorated with chicory leaves that looked like devil s horns  the blobs of marrow bone were beautifully decorated with crunchy breadcrumbs  the whole thing was a solid effort taste wise  the mackerel was delicious  small bannetons of the fish  beautifully trimmed and gently cooked  you could have mistaken it for being raw but something had gone on and the texture was great for mains i ordered roast halibut with cockle ketchup  the missus ordered fillet steak and chips halibut is an amazing fish  but once it s overdone it becomes dense and a bit of a dry mouthful  guess what  mine was overdone  what a crying shame  the cockle sauce was divine  it really was  but the bit i was craving was just a dense block  gutted  me  not the fish  you understand the missus ordered her fillet steak medium so got what she deserved when it came out exactly like she had asked for it  i could tell that it used to be a wonderful piece of meat  the chips however were  again  a let down  triple cooked  if that s what happens to them when they are triple cooked i d prefer the double or single cooked version every time  they were leathery and not fluffy inside like chips should be  i reckon they had been left for a long while out of the fryer  that s how they came across anyhow  there was a mushroom ketchup which was good and the gravy that came in a small jug was delicious but i have to say  there were a few things with the meal that really disappointed  you don t expect to go to a place with such a reputation and get your main course halibut overcooked  you don t expect the chips to be leathery  and you don t expect the bread to be so crunchy as to make it almost wholly unmanageable once the teeth have cracked it into the mouth  i felt like monsieur mange tout  that circus bloke who ate glass and things when i was a kid  as i said there were real highlights to the cooking but these things really brought it down  a real shame as the service was delightful  a lovely chatty sommelier who had all the time in the world for an old ignoramus like me  and a young waiter only too keen to let us know any detail we wanted about the food we came for an amazing experience but left feeling slightly disappointed and short changed  we spent over  200 and only had one bottle of wine and for that money you d expect something approaching perfection  we deffo didn t get that  in fact  i d call it a little careless  the problems were all wholly avoidable with a bit more care and attention ah well  you win some you lose some we chatted together about places we had been to that had been as extravagant but simply better and came up with a good list  and thought of a fair few that were better and a lot cheaper too i must say though  i got food envy when i saw the couple next to us tucking into their meat fruit starter  it looked great  shame we won t be rushing back to try it

455	5.0	Dinner was a delight!  I dined there with my partner in August as a special date night and the food is still devastatingly memorable in my mind.  Mmmmmm...Firstly, I have to say the service was unbelievable.  The manager was so gracious and warm---we had accidentally forgotten to cancel one of our reservations (we hadn't been certain when we would return from a trip abroad so had also made reservations for lunch the following day) which would, by policy, have us incur at least a 50£ charge.  He immediately said it was alright and he just wanted us to have a good time that night.  It would definitely have been soured with a cancellation fee!  Our servers were really wonderful.  I think their names were Leianne and Wanda.  Wanda was especially warm and friendly, completely unpretentious, so attentive---she was so comfortably helpful, I felt like she was my best friend.  Really a top-notch server.Walking into the restaurant, it is immediately a very romantic and extravagant mood.  Dim but accented well, I felt it embodied the concept of the menu---a tribute to history and tradition while cleverly innovating with elegance.  I wish we had taken some time to view the open kitchen but we were so consumed with the food!THE FOOD.  We felt the meat fruit was compulsory given the buzz around it.  I had hesitated because I normally don't really like pate but the flavor and texture of this was AMAZING!  Perfection. And the presentation of encapsulating it within a jelly mandarin orange (even looked bumpy like a real peel!) was really fabulous.  Licked every bit of that pate up!  The salamugundy was so delectable!  The chicken oysters were seriously the most delicious, savory pieces of chicken I have ever had!  They were delicious with the marrow and horseradish cream.For mains, we had the spiced pigeon and pork chop.  I had never had pigeon before but I now know that I love it.  It's a bit like duck, very rich reddish flesh---and it was cooked so well.  Juicy, juicy, juicy.  I honestly can't remember the pork chop very well since it wasn't my dish but I do remember my boyfriend gobbling it up with gusto.  Oh, and we got some carrots on the side which were good but nothing very special.We toyed with the idea of getting 2 desserts but honestly, we were so full by this time.  We ordered the tipsy cake and omg, I wish we had ordered three.  The pillowy sweet bread just melts in your mouth.  And the roasted pineapple was the perfect complement.  It was quite an expensive meal---it added up with the wine and tea (which was also of unique and excellent quality) we had also ordered.  But it was a lovely treat for a romantic evening!	dinner was a delight   i dined there with my partner in august as a special date night and the food is still devastatingly memorable in my mind   mmmmmm   firstly  i have to say the service was unbelievable   the manager was so gracious and warm   we had accidentally forgotten to cancel one of our reservations  we hadn t been certain when we would return from a trip abroad so had also made reservations for lunch the following day  which would  by policy  have us incur at least a 50  charge   he immediately said it was alright and he just wanted us to have a good time that night   it would definitely have been soured with a cancellation fee   our servers were really wonderful   i think their names were leianne and wanda   wanda was especially warm and friendly  completely unpretentious  so attentive   she was so comfortably helpful  i felt like she was my best friend   really a top notch server walking into the restaurant  it is immediately a very romantic and extravagant mood   dim but accented well  i felt it embodied the concept of the menu   a tribute to history and tradition while cleverly innovating with elegance   i wish we had taken some time to view the open kitchen but we were so consumed with the food the food   we felt the meat fruit was compulsory given the buzz around it   i had hesitated because i normally don t really like pate but the flavor and texture of this was amazing   perfection  and the presentation of encapsulating it within a jelly mandarin orange  even looked bumpy like a real peel   was really fabulous   licked every bit of that pate up   the salamugundy was so delectable   the chicken oysters were seriously the most delicious  savory pieces of chicken i have ever had   they were delicious with the marrow and horseradish cream for mains  we had the spiced pigeon and pork chop   i had never had pigeon before but i now know that i love it   it s a bit like duck  very rich reddish flesh   and it was cooked so well   juicy  juicy  juicy   i honestly can t remember the pork chop very well since it wasn t my dish but i do remember my boyfriend gobbling it up with gusto   oh  and we got some carrots on the side which were good but nothing very special we toyed with the idea of getting 2 desserts but honestly  we were so full by this time   we ordered the tipsy cake and omg  i wish we had ordered three   the pillowy sweet bread just melts in your mouth   and the roasted pineapple was the perfect complement   it was quite an expensive meal   it added up with the wine and tea  which was also of unique and excellent quality  we had also ordered   but it was a lovely treat for a romantic evening

I just want to start and finish my review with those words.We were having lunch at Dinner and while Jovanie and i arrived early, Adrienne decided to take a cab and arrived an hour late. So we sat at our table while i got more  and more mad and embarrassed thinking that they were going to ask us to leave. They didn't. They were kind and solicitous the whole time and when she finally got there, our delicious meal started. I ordered Fillet of Aberdeen Angus which was very small yet amazing. The bread that they brought the table was delicious. The fries were heavenly as well. I tasted the other steak because Jovanie had ordered it as well as the pork that Adrienne had ordered. Everything was impeccable . We had two different waiters, one ,who i called Andy Murray, because he sounded and looked a lot like him, was an a amazing server all the way through the meal. Very professional and friendly. Up until this point, i was very dubious about British cuisine as well as British service but this place redeemed all of my doubts. If you have the money , or at least the credit left on your card, eat here. We got the tipsy cake and they also make ice cream with liquid nitrogen tables die, so you know i had to have it. While the ice cream was very tasty, the tipsy cake was amazing.Tipsy cake.	tipsy cake  i just want to start and finish my review with those words we were having lunch at dinner and while jovanie and i arrived early  adrienne decided to take a cab and arrived an hour late  so we sat at our table while i got more  and more mad and embarrassed thinking that they were going to ask us to leave  they didn t  they were kind and solicitous the whole time and when she finally got there  our delicious meal started  i ordered fillet of aberdeen angus which was very small yet amazing  the bread that they brought the table was delicious  the fries were heavenly as well  i tasted the other steak because jovanie had ordered it as well as the pork that adrienne had ordered  everything was impeccable   we had two different waiters  one  who i called andy murray  because he sounded and looked a lot like him  was an a amazing server all the way through the meal  very professional and friendly  up until this point  i was very dubious about british cuisine as well as british service but this place redeemed all of my doubts  if you have the money   or at least the credit left on your card  eat here  we got the tipsy cake and they also make ice cream with liquid nitrogen tables die  so you know i had to have it  while the ice cream was very tasty  the tipsy cake was amazing tipsy cake 
457	4.0	"""Dinner"" was certainly the most hyped new restaurant opening in London in 2011. It shouldn't come as a surprise since it is Heston Blumenthal's restaurant. I had gone to ""Fat Duck"" for lunch shortly after Dinner opened, and it blew my mind. I was determined to try Heston's establishment that was closer to home. It's incredibly difficult to get a decent dinner reservation here, though nowhere as hard as Fat Duck. But if you are prepared to have a late dinner, and by late I mean 10 pm or later, then you can be lucky. The four of us reached here for such a late dinner one evening in October. But the table wasn't ready yet. That came as a surprise, given the time. But we didn't have to wait long. Soon after ordering a round of drinks at the bar, we were ushered in to our table. The dining hall is a separate room from the bar, and it's huge. But it has poor acoustics. Throughout the meal we found it difficult to hear each other at normal volume. Dinner specialises in historical British cuisine. The menu contains items from the 14th century onwards (the dates of origin are mentioned in the menu) ... Dishes that are not eaten anywhere else at present. It's an exciting trip down the history of British food. If you go in a bigger group, then you will be able to sample more chapters of that history. The starters was the most interesting section. I was torn between ""meat fruit"", ""broth of lamb"" and ""rice and flesh"". I settled on the broth of lamb, an 18th century dish that was served with egg, radish and turnip. I also sampled the meat fruit from a friend ... It was a mandarin orange stuffed with chicken liver. I left the rice and flesh, one of the oldest dish on the menu (from 1390), for next time. I went for a more conventional main course.  From amongst the pork chops and the halibut and the pigeons, I picked the fillet of Aberdeen Angus, well done. It was served with mushroom sauce, a novel accompaniment to a steak for me. For dessert I went against the house recommendation of the ""tipsy cake"" and ordered the pudding instead and I did not regret my choice. The three course meal, with a glass of wine and one cocktail, cost us about £80 per person. It wasn't cheap but it wasn't much more expensive than what we had expected. The food and the presentation was great, and Dinner thoroughly deserves its one Michelin star. But no, it isn't the 9th best restaurant in the world ... That would be too much of a stretch."	 dinner  was certainly the most hyped new restaurant opening in london in 2011  it shouldn t come as a surprise since it is heston blumenthal s restaurant  i had gone to  fat duck  for lunch shortly after dinner opened  and it blew my mind  i was determined to try heston s establishment that was closer to home  it s incredibly difficult to get a decent dinner reservation here  though nowhere as hard as fat duck  but if you are prepared to have a late dinner  and by late i mean 10 pm or later  then you can be lucky  the four of us reached here for such a late dinner one evening in october  but the table wasn t ready yet  that came as a surprise  given the time  but we didn t have to wait long  soon after ordering a round of drinks at the bar  we were ushered in to our table  the dining hall is a separate room from the bar  and it s huge  but it has poor acoustics  throughout the meal we found it difficult to hear each other at normal volume  dinner specialises in historical british cuisine  the menu contains items from the 14th century onwards  the dates of origin are mentioned in the menu      dishes that are not eaten anywhere else at present  it s an exciting trip down the history of british food  if you go in a bigger group  then you will be able to sample more chapters of that history  the starters was the most interesting section  i was torn between  meat fruit    broth of lamb  and  rice and flesh   i settled on the broth of lamb  an 18th century dish that was served with egg  radish and turnip  i also sampled the meat fruit from a friend     it was a mandarin orange stuffed with chicken liver  i left the rice and flesh  one of the oldest dish on the menu  from 1390   for next time  i went for a more conventional main course   from amongst the pork chops and the halibut and the pigeons  i picked the fillet of aberdeen angus  well done  it was served with mushroom sauce  a novel accompaniment to a steak for me  for dessert i went against the house recommendation of the  tipsy cake  and ordered the pudding instead and i did not regret my choice  the three course meal  with a glass of wine and one cocktail  cost us about  80 per person  it wasn t cheap but it wasn t much more expensive than what we had expected  the food and the presentation was great  and dinner thoroughly deserves its one michelin star  but no  it isn t the 9th best restaurant in the world     that would be too much of a stretch

460	2.0	NOT WORTH IT.We dined here in August while visiting my wife's daughter who lives/works nearby and enjoying the fantastic job Britain did hosting the Olympics.  Wish I could say the same for Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.All three of us are spoiled and get to eat at many fine restaurants.  This place failed to live up to all the hype.  The food was okay, but we certainly didn't feel anything was at all memorable.  Frankly all the provenance and researching and updating old recipes and dishes is an interesting and worthwhile endeavor, but you don't get extra points if the meal delivered in the end is nothing special.  Make that magnificent, given the lofty prices charged.The other aspect of our disappointment was the service.  You could fairly well guarantee that if you were in mid-sentence, some waiter would interrupt you.  Perhaps the staff is pressured to turn the tables.  Don't know if that's the case, but it certainly felt like it.P.S. We had some terrific dining while in London, and I plan to write a more detailed review about a world class restaurant, The Ledbury, where everything is done right.	not worth it we dined here in august while visiting my wife s daughter who lives works nearby and enjoying the fantastic job britain did hosting the olympics   wish i could say the same for dinner by heston blumenthal all three of us are spoiled and get to eat at many fine restaurants   this place failed to live up to all the hype   the food was okay  but we certainly didn t feel anything was at all memorable   frankly all the provenance and researching and updating old recipes and dishes is an interesting and worthwhile endeavor  but you don t get extra points if the meal delivered in the end is nothing special   make that magnificent  given the lofty prices charged the other aspect of our disappointment was the service   you could fairly well guarantee that if you were in mid sentence  some waiter would interrupt you   perhaps the staff is pressured to turn the tables   don t know if that s the case  but it certainly felt like it p s  we had some terrific dining while in london  and i plan to write a more detailed review about a world class restaurant  the ledbury  where everything is done right 
461	5.0	"This might go down among the best meals we have had in London lately, as well as among the best meals of this vacation. The cooking was flawless, the service impeccable and the ambience befitting a Michelin star restaurant.Our first course included the much talked about Meat Fruit. Interestingly enough this was the only dish we had that qualifies as molecular gastronomy. The foie gras parfait was moulded into a shell made of mandarin orange geleé. Truth be told, I enjoy a seared slice of foie gras with a fruit compote accompaniment. To me, the searing adds a textural dimension that makes it a touch better. This was probably the least successful dish from a taste standpoint, whereas the presentation was really dramatic.The other appetizer, Nettle porridge with Frog legs was perfectly executed, unique and flavorful - characteristics it shared with all of the other dishes we sampled. This was the first time I had savory oats and they did not disappoint. The nettles were subtle. In combination with the heirloom jewel beets, garlic and fennel, they presented interesting and novel flavors.Our main dishes were the cod in cider with chard and mussels, and the powdered duck breast with fennel and umbles. I haven't the foggiest idea what part of the duck was powdered. I had to look up ""umbles"" to write this review (I found out that it means organ meats). Regardless, both mains were delicious. Perfectly executed with precisely balanced flavors. In fact, if it weren't for the chef's reputation as a mad scientist, I would have called this a great example of fine cooking.We had the Tipsy cake with spit roasted pineapple for dessert. No complaints, but nothing to sit up and take notice either. The brûléed pineapple was a nice touch.We asked the sommelier to pair wines with each of the dishes. He was extremely helpful, quite knowledgeable and did a fine job. We sampled a Ruinart NV champagne, white & red Burgundies and a Jurancon sweet wine with foie gras which was new to me - much like a Sauternes with a lighter, fresher profile.All in all, we think it is well worth a visit!"	this might go down among the best meals we have had in london lately  as well as among the best meals of this vacation  the cooking was flawless  the service impeccable and the ambience befitting a michelin star restaurant our first course included the much talked about meat fruit  interestingly enough this was the only dish we had that qualifies as molecular gastronomy  the foie gras parfait was moulded into a shell made of mandarin orange gele   truth be told  i enjoy a seared slice of foie gras with a fruit compote accompaniment  to me  the searing adds a textural dimension that makes it a touch better  this was probably the least successful dish from a taste standpoint  whereas the presentation was really dramatic the other appetizer  nettle porridge with frog legs was perfectly executed  unique and flavorful   characteristics it shared with all of the other dishes we sampled  this was the first time i had savory oats and they did not disappoint  the nettles were subtle  in combination with the heirloom jewel beets  garlic and fennel  they presented interesting and novel flavors our main dishes were the cod in cider with chard and mussels  and the powdered duck breast with fennel and umbles  i haven t the foggiest idea what part of the duck was powdered  i had to look up  umbles  to write this review  i found out that it means organ meats   regardless  both mains were delicious  perfectly executed with precisely balanced flavors  in fact  if it weren t for the chef s reputation as a mad scientist  i would have called this a great example of fine cooking we had the tipsy cake with spit roasted pineapple for dessert  no complaints  but nothing to sit up and take notice either  the br l ed pineapple was a nice touch we asked the sommelier to pair wines with each of the dishes  he was extremely helpful  quite knowledgeable and did a fine job  we sampled a ruinart nv champagne  white   red burgundies and a jurancon sweet wine with foie gras which was new to me   much like a sauternes with a lighter  fresher profile all in all  we think it is well worth a visit

Places come and go, concepts change, chefs depart -  but the very best in the business demonstrate they are on the money from day one. These places opened their doors to the public in the last 18 months and clearly have staying power. We have no doubt they will leave an indelible mark on their respective dining landscapes over the coming years.This was one of the first meals we had in 2012 while visiting friends and family in London. Phoning up three months in advance for a weekday lunch, we managed to secure a table and somehow bypass the five-month waiting list. Housed in the glorious surrounds of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, Dinner's tables are some of the most coveted in the world. It probably has something to do with Heston's mega-popularity, and the fact that diners can hang out in one of the city's best hotels for a few hours. There are two menus available at lunch - both consisting of dishes that have been inspired by recipes from between 1500-1700 - a la carte and a three-course set menu for only $40. This establishes it as one of the greatest bargains of the year - excellent service, views over the park, a glimpse into the mechanics of the cavernous kitchen (which includes rows of spit-roasted pineapples) and great wine by the bottle from $30, you can't go wrong.	sharky s best new restaurantsby sharking for chips and drinks the restaurant industry is a fickle beast and survival isn t always easy  places come and go  concepts change  chefs depart    but the very best in the business demonstrate they are on the money from day one  these places opened their doors to the public in the last 18 months and clearly have staying power  we have no doubt they will leave an indelible mark on their respective dining landscapes over the coming years this was one of the first meals we had in 2012 while visiting friends and family in london  phoning up three months in advance for a weekday lunch  we managed to secure a table and somehow bypass the five month waiting list  housed in the glorious surrounds of the mandarin oriental hyde park  dinner s tables are some of the most coveted in the world  it probably has something to do with heston s mega popularity  and the fact that diners can hang out in one of the city s best hotels for a few hours  there are two menus available at lunch   both consisting of dishes that have been inspired by recipes from between 1500 1700   a la carte and a three course set menu for only  40  this establishes it as one of the greatest bargains of the year   excellent service  views over the park  a glimpse into the mechanics of the cavernous kitchen  which includes rows of spit roasted pineapples  and great wine by the bottle from  30  you can t go wrong 
465	3.0	In 2010, news of a London opening by Heston was greeted with enthusiasm and plenty waited with bated breath for the actual date. The date was finally announced for 31st January and there was a flurry of emails and tweets during the week before reservation lines opened. You'll have to be hibernating under a rock not to notice what was happening. Barely a few minutes into the day reservations opened and all I could see was a steady stream of tweets with people announcing their successful reservations and echoes of others bemoaning if the system crashed. At 11.30am was when I finally decided to send an email to friends to see if anyone was interested. To my surprise, there was quick action from an otherwise usually laid back group my friends are and in a blink of an eye, I found myself with a lunch booking. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I found myself walking up the stairs of the Mandarin Oriental and into Dinner by Heston. I have to say that it's not exactly visible as there were no prominent signs and not surprising to see some lost souls wandering around. The first thing we tried was the meat fruit. his has been raved and described about by so many that it could stretch as long as to the moon and back. It certainly deserves all the accolades and gushes of compliments. The most beautiful light creamy texture possible, I have never had chicken liver parfait tasted this mind blowingly good. Being served with the aesthetic of a mandarin could only add to its uniqueness.	in 2010  news of a london opening by heston was greeted with enthusiasm and plenty waited with bated breath for the actual date  the date was finally announced for 31st january and there was a flurry of emails and tweets during the week before reservation lines opened  you ll have to be hibernating under a rock not to notice what was happening  barely a few minutes into the day reservations opened and all i could see was a steady stream of tweets with people announcing their successful reservations and echoes of others bemoaning if the system crashed  at 11 30am was when i finally decided to send an email to friends to see if anyone was interested  to my surprise  there was quick action from an otherwise usually laid back group my friends are and in a blink of an eye  i found myself with a lunch booking  on a rainy sunday afternoon  i found myself walking up the stairs of the mandarin oriental and into dinner by heston  i have to say that it s not exactly visible as there were no prominent signs and not surprising to see some lost souls wandering around  the first thing we tried was the meat fruit  his has been raved and described about by so many that it could stretch as long as to the moon and back  it certainly deserves all the accolades and gushes of compliments  the most beautiful light creamy texture possible  i have never had chicken liver parfait tasted this mind blowingly good  being served with the aesthetic of a mandarin could only add to its uniqueness 
466	5.0	I was treated to lunch as a birthday surprise and i had the most wonderful day.  My other half confessed he had been trying to get a table at the fat duck for months with no success so settled to try for dinner instead. The restraunt was modern and spacious but  filled  up pretty quickly. I was impressed by the off. The menu was very detailed in the heratige of each dish and the waiter was able to elaborate even more, adding personal recommendations. Whilst it didn't change our choices, was good to know he'd actually eaten the food. The smelliers recommendation was beautiful and we were not let down in the slightest. The snails in marrow bone with pickled veggies was a triumph to start. The belly pork with air light puffs of cracking the tipsy pudding and roasted pineaple still stick in my thoughts 8 months on. The extra attention to detail was incredible. The website mentions that lunch time dinners have an hour and a half  slot but 3 hours flew by as we received complimentary desserts for both my birthday and for both of us for our engagement. I was sat where i could see into the kitchen which was great fun and we were shown around the kitchens and met the chef as well. We were made to feel very welcome and despite the very full restaurant given every care and attention. A wonderful experience and just makes me even more determined to finally get a table at the fat duck!	i was treated to lunch as a birthday surprise and i had the most wonderful day   my other half confessed he had been trying to get a table at the fat duck for months with no success so settled to try for dinner instead  the restraunt was modern and spacious but  filled  up pretty quickly  i was impressed by the off  the menu was very detailed in the heratige of each dish and the waiter was able to elaborate even more  adding personal recommendations  whilst it didn t change our choices  was good to know he d actually eaten the food  the smelliers recommendation was beautiful and we were not let down in the slightest  the snails in marrow bone with pickled veggies was a triumph to start  the belly pork with air light puffs of cracking the tipsy pudding and roasted pineaple still stick in my thoughts 8 months on  the extra attention to detail was incredible  the website mentions that lunch time dinners have an hour and a half  slot but 3 hours flew by as we received complimentary desserts for both my birthday and for both of us for our engagement  i was sat where i could see into the kitchen which was great fun and we were shown around the kitchens and met the chef as well  we were made to feel very welcome and despite the very full restaurant given every care and attention  a wonderful experience and just makes me even more determined to finally get a table at the fat duck

We also had to get the room which is 1500 pound minimum because we had too many people.They started us with risotto, calf tail in red wine and saffron. The risotto was too raw for me. I don't like it when I can crunch down on them. It was pretty creamy and you can taste the butter in it.The next was the meat fruit, which I will give him prop in making it so beautiful. This mandarin looking thing was filled with chicken liver. It's not very flavorful or anything, but the toast was pretty good with it. It comes with way too much liver... I only ate about 1/3 before I started feeling a little sick.For my main course, I chose the Roast Turbot, which is a fish. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it very well. The pigeon was also pretty good, very juicy and tender. Wish I could've gotten more of this in stead of the meat fruit.The tipsy cake was absolutely delicious. Way better than the chocolate bar I chose. The bread was super fluffy and buttery and sweet. I should've just bought some wimbledon final tickets instead of coming here.	i m not sure what the hype is about here  i was quite disappointed for the quality given the price  we also had to get the room which is 1500 pound minimum because we had too many people they started us with risotto  calf tail in red wine and saffron  the risotto was too raw for me  i don t like it when i can crunch down on them  it was pretty creamy and you can taste the butter in it the next was the meat fruit  which i will give him prop in making it so beautiful  this mandarin looking thing was filled with chicken liver  it s not very flavorful or anything  but the toast was pretty good with it  it comes with way too much liver    i only ate about 1 3 before i started feeling a little sick for my main course  i chose the roast turbot  which is a fish  it was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it very well  the pigeon was also pretty good  very juicy and tender  wish i could ve gotten more of this in stead of the meat fruit the tipsy cake was absolutely delicious  way better than the chocolate bar i chose  the bread was super fluffy and buttery and sweet  i should ve just bought some wimbledon final tickets instead of coming here 
468	5.0	"Went here last week for lunch.The food, service and atmosphere were excellent.This is an expensive restaurant, so no surprises there. The restaurant's design and furnishings are all fine - as is the panoramic view over Hyde Park - but that's not really the main attraction so let's not dwell on them (yes, there's some flashy clock mechanism, giant jelly moulds for lampshades on the walls and the kitchen's on open view - so you can see the pineapples on the spit roast) - it's the food that matters. The portions are very large. I shared a starter and we opted for the almost famous ""meat fruit"". Highly recommended if you like foie gras and chicken liver parfait with a delicate mandarin jelly, shaped like the namesake of the hotel where Dinner is located; a fantastically memorable dish. On the waiter's recommendation we opted for the £72 between 2 people Wing of aged Aberdeen Angus Black. It was deliciously tender and meaningfully meaty but didn't look as impressive as we'd expected it to be, because the waiter had described it as a centrepiece. The wing arrived slightly underdone (more rare than medium rare) and a replacement arrived with an absolute minimum of fuss and delay. Accompanying the wing were a mushroom ketchup and berry jus - both delicious - with a cup of triple-fried chips on the side. We couldn't finish our main due to a meat induced near coma. There's room for improvement - the facilities were not nearby (guess a short walk is the price we pay for a restaurant based on some of the world's most valuable real-estate) - would have liked to deduct half a star from this review because with a restaurant of Dinner's calibre I'd have expected an amuse bouche; the bread and butter were excellent quality though and to deduct a whole star would be churlish. At the end of the meal we were offered a sort of post amuse bouche of a small cup of white chocolate creme with an almond biscuit - whilst not bad, it didn't rock my world in any way. With our meal we enjoyed two excellent non alcoholic cocktails - my friend went for a Green Goblin and I had a .....something or other sunrise - both well were made drinks that lasted. Looking forward to a return visit, in which case I'll be sorely tempted to just have a couple of starters - one of which will have to be the roasted marrowbone with anchovies. Dinner is in many ways a very different experience to the Fat Duck, yet it retains Heston Blumenthal's imprint - despite his comments in interview that it's really Ashley Palmer-Watts' restaurant with Blumenthal's name on the door - whilst not overtly displaying molecular gastronomy, there's definitely some heavyweight detail going on in the cooking; the menu's historic recipes span several centuries and it's Heston Blumenthal's clear passion for gastro historical-reenactment with a twist, that define's the food."	went here last week for lunch the food  service and atmosphere were excellent this is an expensive restaurant  so no surprises there  the restaurant s design and furnishings are all fine   as is the panoramic view over hyde park   but that s not really the main attraction so let s not dwell on them  yes  there s some flashy clock mechanism  giant jelly moulds for lampshades on the walls and the kitchen s on open view   so you can see the pineapples on the spit roast    it s the food that matters  the portions are very large  i shared a starter and we opted for the almost famous  meat fruit   highly recommended if you like foie gras and chicken liver parfait with a delicate mandarin jelly  shaped like the namesake of the hotel where dinner is located  a fantastically memorable dish  on the waiter s recommendation we opted for the  72 between 2 people wing of aged aberdeen angus black  it was deliciously tender and meaningfully meaty but didn t look as impressive as we d expected it to be  because the waiter had described it as a centrepiece  the wing arrived slightly underdone  more rare than medium rare  and a replacement arrived with an absolute minimum of fuss and delay  accompanying the wing were a mushroom ketchup and berry jus   both delicious   with a cup of triple fried chips on the side  we couldn t finish our main due to a meat induced near coma  there s room for improvement   the facilities were not nearby  guess a short walk is the price we pay for a restaurant based on some of the world s most valuable real estate    would have liked to deduct half a star from this review because with a restaurant of dinner s calibre i d have expected an amuse bouche  the bread and butter were excellent quality though and to deduct a whole star would be churlish  at the end of the meal we were offered a sort of post amuse bouche of a small cup of white chocolate creme with an almond biscuit   whilst not bad  it didn t rock my world in any way  with our meal we enjoyed two excellent non alcoholic cocktails   my friend went for a green goblin and i had a      something or other sunrise   both well were made drinks that lasted  looking forward to a return visit  in which case i ll be sorely tempted to just have a couple of starters   one of which will have to be the roasted marrowbone with anchovies  dinner is in many ways a very different experience to the fat duck  yet it retains heston blumenthal s imprint   despite his comments in interview that it s really ashley palmer watts  restaurant with blumenthal s name on the door   whilst not overtly displaying molecular gastronomy  there s definitely some heavyweight detail going on in the cooking  the menu s historic recipes span several centuries and it s heston blumenthal s clear passion for gastro historical reenactment with a twist  that define s the food

470	4.0	"I am really, really proud to be the 3rd person to review Dinner. I had put all thoughts of getting a table for the next 6 months completely out of my mind as nigh on impossible, and so was flabbergastered when my brother announced that he'd managed to secure a table for lunch. I was practically hyperventilating with excitement - which was only exacerbated when I noticed who was sitting in middle of the room - only Heston Blooming Blumenthal himself. Reader, I am not normally a star struck person, but suddenly I was in love and could barely standing up. The room is vast and has a wonderful view of Hyde Park, but couldn't really escape the feeling of being part of a hotel. I remember reading that it is formed out of part of the old breakfast rooms, and I did feel like I should be expecting a waiter to take my tea or coffee orders at any point...albeit posh ones. Nonetheless - this was the place I'd been reading - and drooling - about as the reviews starting pouring in, and so the excitement flooded back as we were led to our table and I began to notice all the details the reviewers had pointed out: THERE WERE THE PINEAPPLES! THERE WERE THE JELLY MOULD LIGHTS! My brother (despite being in the restaurant industry, I might add) didn't seem to know that much about the menu, so I quickly launched into an explanation of what he should have and what we had to order. I should now point out that I don't eat red meat. This meant that I forced him to have the Meat Fruit ""because we have to"" despite the fact that I wouldn't actually try it - although the fact that his face lit up as soon as he tasted it assured me that I'd steered him in the right direction. I started with the scallops with cucumber ketchup, which we both agreed was rather disappointing - yes, the scallops were good, but there are only so many bits of roasted cucumber you can eat without getting bored, and I would have taken regular ketchup over the cucumber variety every time. My brother had some concoction of steak and bone marrow next, which he said was very good, but was hard pressed to say that it was the Best Steak He'd Ever Eaten - with good quality ingredients, which of course these were, it's hard to get anything too wrong with a steak. My Cod In Cider, which came with a mussel broth, was far superior, and conversely I could say that it was possibly The Best Fish I'd Ever Eaten. I think the waiter said they poach it in oil before pan frying it, and it was positively sumptuous. We'd pre-ordered the famed Tipsy Cake, and also had the Brown Bread Ice-Cream, which we were warned would be ""slightly more savoury than most people would think."" I can honestly say I didn't get the big deal with the Tipsy Cake - the brioche was nice and yes, roasted pineapple is novel (although tasted half like fresh and half like dried pineapple), but it didn't really blow me away. The Brown Bread ice cream was better, but I felt this was certainly the weakest course in the meal. A post-dessert of white chocolate and earl grey ganache was far superior - a quirky combo that really worked, and a lovely way to finish off the meal. So why the four stars? Partly to be controversial - everyone and his dog seems to be giving Dinner 5 stars, to the point of which I think they were preparing to do so even before the restaurant had opened. But also because, in all honesty, not every dish was a hit. It was a fantastic experience, and one I will never forget, but I wasn't left dreaming of dishes or desperate to go back, suggesting that perhaps it wasn't quite the Perfection Heston was in search of."	i am really  really proud to be the 3rd person to review dinner  i had put all thoughts of getting a table for the next 6 months completely out of my mind as nigh on impossible  and so was flabbergastered when my brother announced that he d managed to secure a table for lunch  i was practically hyperventilating with excitement   which was only exacerbated when i noticed who was sitting in middle of the room   only heston blooming blumenthal himself  reader  i am not normally a star struck person  but suddenly i was in love and could barely standing up  the room is vast and has a wonderful view of hyde park  but couldn t really escape the feeling of being part of a hotel  i remember reading that it is formed out of part of the old breakfast rooms  and i did feel like i should be expecting a waiter to take my tea or coffee orders at any point   albeit posh ones  nonetheless   this was the place i d been reading   and drooling   about as the reviews starting pouring in  and so the excitement flooded back as we were led to our table and i began to notice all the details the reviewers had pointed out  there were the pineapples  there were the jelly mould lights  my brother  despite being in the restaurant industry  i might add  didn t seem to know that much about the menu  so i quickly launched into an explanation of what he should have and what we had to order  i should now point out that i don t eat red meat  this meant that i forced him to have the meat fruit  because we have to  despite the fact that i wouldn t actually try it   although the fact that his face lit up as soon as he tasted it assured me that i d steered him in the right direction  i started with the scallops with cucumber ketchup  which we both agreed was rather disappointing   yes  the scallops were good  but there are only so many bits of roasted cucumber you can eat without getting bored  and i would have taken regular ketchup over the cucumber variety every time  my brother had some concoction of steak and bone marrow next  which he said was very good  but was hard pressed to say that it was the best steak he d ever eaten   with good quality ingredients  which of course these were  it s hard to get anything too wrong with a steak  my cod in cider  which came with a mussel broth  was far superior  and conversely i could say that it was possibly the best fish i d ever eaten  i think the waiter said they poach it in oil before pan frying it  and it was positively sumptuous  we d pre ordered the famed tipsy cake  and also had the brown bread ice cream  which we were warned would be  slightly more savoury than most people would think   i can honestly say i didn t get the big deal with the tipsy cake   the brioche was nice and yes  roasted pineapple is novel  although tasted half like fresh and half like dried pineapple   but it didn t really blow me away  the brown bread ice cream was better  but i felt this was certainly the weakest course in the meal  a post dessert of white chocolate and earl grey ganache was far superior   a quirky combo that really worked  and a lovely way to finish off the meal  so why the four stars  partly to be controversial   everyone and his dog seems to be giving dinner 5 stars  to the point of which i think they were preparing to do so even before the restaurant had opened  but also because  in all honesty  not every dish was a hit  it was a fantastic experience  and one i will never forget  but i wasn t left dreaming of dishes or desperate to go back  suggesting that perhaps it wasn t quite the perfection heston was in search of

472	5.0	Some time ago, I spent a good half an hour or so discussing Tudor banquets at Hampton Court and, despite the risk of turning into a latter-era Henry VIII, vowed someday I'd try and experience this feast. Even if it meant spending the next month living at the gym in apology to my arteries. Dinner by Heston Blumenthal isn't quite this Tudor feast, but it'll do as the nearest thing available until time travel's invented. Even the setting overlooking Hyde Park makes you forget that you're in a hotel and instead conjures up the image of the royal party galloping back through the park to the finest food of their era. And Henry would probably approve of Heston's olde England-inspired menu. For those who've missed the hype (in which case, where have you been?), this is not the Fat Duck does London, this is a very different beast indeed. Dinner, overseen by Heston and led by Ashley Palmer-Watts, could be seen as an extension of the chef's Channel 4 Feasts series, as he delves back into England's culinary heritage for inspiration. And, as the name of the restaurant itself would imply, there's more of a hint of playfulness running throughout a menu full of bold, powerful flavours. Let's stop for a minute right here and warn you what to expect. Dinner is not cheap, unless you go for the excellent value Monday to Friday £28 lunch deal. We missed the Monday to Friday aspect of this, realised we were going to have to go full-whack, shrugged, and decided what the hell. Our credit cards didn't thank us, but our bellies certainly did. For starters, their was no question that we weren't going to try the curiously-titled Meat Fruit. Arriving like a tangerine with grilled bread, this was a dish that teased and dared you to go inside. The mandarin covering was like a light jelly that complement the rich chicken liver parfait perfectly. Rich, yes, but lighter than you'd expect. Equally good was the broth of lamb, with sweetbreads, assorted vegetables and a perfectly slow-cooked hen's egg floating in the middle. Such was the aroma, I almost inhaled this. The broth had such a depth of flavour that it threatened to overwhelm the other flavours, but just stayed on the right side of tying the dish together, with the sweetbreads in particular delicious. For mains, it was onto the powdered duck with smoked fennel and potato puree and, on the recommendation of one of the many excellent staff attending to us, and spiced pigeon with artichoke hearts and ale sauce. Neither animal should have the right to be this obscenely tender. You could leave the pigeon on your tongue and it would melt straight through, while the duck (powdered lightly with spices, not talcum powder, although the latter wouldn't surprised you with Heston) was slow-cooked to perfection, with a layer of fat around pink meat. The texture was almost more akin to lamb, the taste was definitely duck. One small criticism was the fennel had been smoked a little too long, but this is a minor quibble. All this, though, was merely softening our stomachs up for the final assault: dessert. At this stage, the kitchen seriously stepped the action up a gear, in case we hadn't expanded enough. Brown bread ice cream with a salted caramel sauce was refreshing and devoured with relish. The chocolate bar with ginger ice cream was thick, rich and played with your tastebuds, yet didn't weigh your stomach down. Dinner could market these as a snack for those in need of a comfort snack on the sofa and would make a killing. And finally came the unexpected highlight - a petite four of Earl Grey ganache with caraway seed biscuit. This was thick and creamy with the tea flavour dominating but not overwhelming. As my friend said, if it wasn't inappropriate, she would have licked the cup dry. You could make a few minor criticisms if you were looking for absolute perfection. The presentation was occasionally a little less than you'd expect and, while the meal was excellent throughout, it would perhaps be too much to describe as absolutely mind-blowing. And, on a personal level, I shed a small tear inside when I learnt the 72-hour slow-cooked beef wasn't available for our sitting. But this is casting around for faults for the sake of it and, as Dinner gets into its stride, it would be no shock to see these ironed out completely. And given the amount of happy noises coming from both of us during the meal and the sheer joy, depth and fun throughout the two hours we were seated, perhaps even a tad ungracious. It was good, let's leave it at that. For the special, if limited, lunch menu and the unexpectedly reasonable wine by the glass (but definitely not the bottle), this is actually an absolute bargain of high-end cooking at prices that won't break the bank. But, to hell with it, go ahead, splash out and enjoy, because I've not had many better meals. The only danger is that such is the richness of the courses that I may now be in danger of contracting gout.

476	3.0	For those of you who have spent the last year only eating in MacDonalds, or who don't care a fig for fine dining, bald headed culinary Wonka Heston Blumenthal (he of the snail porridge and 'food as theatre' TV programmes) has just opened a new restaurant called Dinner on the most expensive street corner in Western Europe. Restaurateurs. Don't. Get. Any. More. Exciting. Than. Him.The room is fairly generic opulent hotel resto chic. Neutral beige palate, expensive fixtures and a proliferation of arseholes in suits. It is the dining room of the Mandarin Oriental, one of London's most expensive hotels, after all. That being said, there are moments of zany Heston-ism scattered around; jelly moulds act as light fittings, the back bar is lit with gummi coloured bottles of booze and serried ranks of pineapples roast on a spit powered by the largest Swiss watch you'll ever see (I'll come back to those...).It ain't another Fat Duck. Neither is it just a posh food pit for fat cats to roll around in. It's somewhere between the two, but mostly just a five star hotel restaurant. It's less complex than you'd expect. There's no nine course set tasting menu here (no tasting menu at all, unless you're in the Chef's Table overlooking the pass), just three simple courses, each with 8 or 10 options. Recipes aren't beset with foams and gels and carnival flourish, but are taken from the annals of British food history, the grand dishes served to our forefathers (or at least the forefathers belonging to the monied arseholes in suits).As you'd expect, the prices are challenging in places, challenging to those not on expense account dining certainly. While there are a number of wines in the 28 page list below £100, the vast bulk of the list is pitched above this point (some considerably so), that being said, we found a very pleasant Fleurie at £45. More surprising is a three course lunch set menu at a very reasonable £28. I go for this while my guest plumps for the a la carte option. I've seen one too many reviews not to have heard of the Meat Fruit, a chicken liver parfait coated in mandarin gel, shaped and textured like a little mandarin. We add one of those to the table too, with the current waiting list at 6 months it's going to be a while before I'm back to try it again. My Ragoo of Pigs Ears is a real star. It's been braised for hours with sweet onion and parsley and the cartilage is sweet and soft, an intensely concentrated meaty kick. Dr Science goes for the Salamagundy, a perfectly constructed and flavoursome hot salad of chicken oysters, bone marrow and a light horseradish cream. If anything it's a little soft and texturally lacking, but that's not much to lay against it. And the Meat Fruit? It's a ball of chicken liver parfait. Strangely tasteless without the char of the sourdough. I don't think I saw a single table go without one though. The Roast Quail from the set menu was another flavour triumph for my cheaper menu choice. The turnips served with it were subtly smoked and then roasted, just the sort of thing you hope for from Heston. Soft game breast worked well barely cooked, though the just cooked meat was remarkably difficult to separate from the tiny quail legs. The 72 hour slow roast rib of angus beef managed to arouse high passion on arrival, a thick lozenge of dark meat, served with a thick jus, cubes of ox tongue and baby veg. It was good, but certainly not brilliant. The meat had the texture of a hunk of salt beef, and was relatively one dimensional in its flavour. Definitely one that didn't live up to my hype. That being said, we finished on a storming note, with the Tipsy Cake. A baked brioche, crystal studded with sugar, cooked in cream, Sauternes and brandy. It came served with a slice of the pineapple from earlier mentioned spit roast and my rapidly expiring heart. Pudding perfection from 1810; no wonder they had a life expectancy of less than 45 back then.	for those of you who have spent the last year only eating in macdonalds  or who don t care a fig for fine dining  bald headed culinary wonka heston blumenthal  he of the snail porridge and  food as theatre  tv programmes  has just opened a new restaurant called dinner on the most expensive street corner in western europe  restaurateurs  don t  get  any  more  exciting  than  him the room is fairly generic opulent hotel resto chic  neutral beige palate  expensive fixtures and a proliferation of arseholes in suits  it is the dining room of the mandarin oriental  one of london s most expensive hotels  after all  that being said  there are moments of zany heston ism scattered around  jelly moulds act as light fittings  the back bar is lit with gummi coloured bottles of booze and serried ranks of pineapples roast on a spit powered by the largest swiss watch you ll ever see  i ll come back to those     it ain t another fat duck  neither is it just a posh food pit for fat cats to roll around in  it s somewhere between the two  but mostly just a five star hotel restaurant  it s less complex than you d expect  there s no nine course set tasting menu here  no tasting menu at all  unless you re in the chef s table overlooking the pass   just three simple courses  each with 8 or 10 options  recipes aren t beset with foams and gels and carnival flourish  but are taken from the annals of british food history  the grand dishes served to our forefathers  or at least the forefathers belonging to the monied arseholes in suits  as you d expect  the prices are challenging in places  challenging to those not on expense account dining certainly  while there are a number of wines in the 28 page list below  100  the vast bulk of the list is pitched above this point  some considerably so   that being said  we found a very pleasant fleurie at  45  more surprising is a three course lunch set menu at a very reasonable  28  i go for this while my guest plumps for the a la carte option  i ve seen one too many reviews not to have heard of the meat fruit  a chicken liver parfait coated in mandarin gel  shaped and textured like a little mandarin  we add one of those to the table too  with the current waiting list at 6 months it s going to be a while before i m back to try it again  my ragoo of pigs ears is a real star  it s been braised for hours with sweet onion and parsley and the cartilage is sweet and soft  an intensely concentrated meaty kick  dr science goes for the salamagundy  a perfectly constructed and flavoursome hot salad of chicken oysters  bone marrow and a light horseradish cream  if anything it s a little soft and texturally lacking  but that s not much to lay against it  and the meat fruit  it s a ball of chicken liver parfait  strangely tasteless without the char of the sourdough  i don t think i saw a single table go without one though  the roast quail from the set menu was another flavour triumph for my cheaper menu choice  the turnips served with it were subtly smoked and then roasted  just the sort of thing you hope for from heston  soft game breast worked well barely cooked  though the just cooked meat was remarkably difficult to separate from the tiny quail legs  the 72 hour slow roast rib of angus beef managed to arouse high passion on arrival  a thick lozenge of dark meat  served with a thick jus  cubes of ox tongue and baby veg  it was good  but certainly not brilliant  the meat had the texture of a hunk of salt beef  and was relatively one dimensional in its flavour  definitely one that didn t live up to my hype  that being said  we finished on a storming note  with the tipsy cake  a baked brioche  crystal studded with sugar  cooked in cream  sauternes and brandy  it came served with a slice of the pineapple from earlier mentioned spit roast and my rapidly expiring heart  pudding perfection from 1810  no wonder they had a life expectancy of less than 45 back then 
477	4.0	Finally, excellent food in London. Yum yum yum. The food here very tasty and fresh. The meat fruit for starter,  the fillet of Aberdeen Angus and the chocolate souffle with peanut butter ice cream were prepared/cooked to perfection! We were lucky to be seated by the window that we were able to enjoy the view of Hyde Park as well as the clear glass covered kitchen. It was really fun watching the chefs preparing busily the food for the guests. As for the decor, it is simple but elegant and the ambiance is  british casual. Great day and great food. Thanks to my husband for the hook up here.	finally  excellent food in london  yum yum yum  the food here very tasty and fresh  the meat fruit for starter   the fillet of aberdeen angus and the chocolate souffle with peanut butter ice cream were prepared cooked to perfection  we were lucky to be seated by the window that we were able to enjoy the view of hyde park as well as the clear glass covered kitchen  it was really fun watching the chefs preparing busily the food for the guests  as for the decor  it is simple but elegant and the ambiance is  british casual  great day and great food  thanks to my husband for the hook up here 
478	5.0	WOOOWWWWW... seriously. One can only expect the best from the 3 star Michelin chef, Heston Blumenthal. The signature dish is the Meat Fruit appetiser, which... well. I don't want to really tell everyone the secrets before it opens (so I will be as discrete as possible). Let's just say that it's an experience, not just a dinner. He really does his homework. The flavors to his bread/icecream dessert dish came in 3 different steps. I was impressed. The chocolate bar was out-of-this world, intense and addictive. The slow roasted pineapple dessert was flavorful and intense. Now that dessert is done. I would not suggest the broth as an appetiser for people who like light flavors first. I found it a bit aggressive and a bit like miso soup, which is not bad, only, I wasn't expecting it, so it was a bit intense. My favourite starter was the meat fruit. It didn't feel like you were eating, it was so soft that you feel like you are imagining the food, yet the flavor is there and the taste is to die for. The ketchup in the scallops dish was quite a good addition to the meal. It was creative and impactful. The duck main dish was perfect. Absolutely perfect. The sauce was quite good with it, however, I regretted not trying something more experimental for my plate. The Beef plate was a huge favourite, unfortunately, too much of a favourite for there to be enough when I arrived. The fish was tender and fresh. The pigeon left me a bit confused. I didn't understand it's texture. It was extremely tender, delicious, but it left me with a confused feeling... as if I didn't feel like I was eating meat. The pork chop was to die for!!!!!! by far the winner of my favourite main dish. It was tender, packed with rich flavor and well... i don't know if i have ever experienced pork chop this way before. As for the wine, the selection was great, expensive, but great. The service was good. We were there before opening, so I imagine everyone was quite new. We didn't meet the chef, and this was the greatest let down we experienced. It would have been an honor to have met him. The architecture was ok. I didn't like it too much. the light fixtures looked like bunt cake pans... The private room was great (and the walls were leather) I wish the place looked more like that. It would have been much more authentic and less.... late 80s-early 90s modern. The only really cool thing about the architecture was the open windowed kitchen. That was great. It was fascinating to see the chefs at work while eating. This made it feel like a lab more than anything else. Reservation is a must and I believe there are no more available right now up until May. I guess you'll need some luck to get a place. I think you should go.	wooowwwww    seriously  one can only expect the best from the 3 star michelin chef  heston blumenthal  the signature dish is the meat fruit appetiser  which    well  i don t want to really tell everyone the secrets before it opens  so i will be as discrete as possible   let s just say that it s an experience  not just a dinner  he really does his homework  the flavors to his bread icecream dessert dish came in 3 different steps  i was impressed  the chocolate bar was out of this world  intense and addictive  the slow roasted pineapple dessert was flavorful and intense  now that dessert is done  i would not suggest the broth as an appetiser for people who like light flavors first  i found it a bit aggressive and a bit like miso soup  which is not bad  only  i wasn t expecting it  so it was a bit intense  my favourite starter was the meat fruit  it didn t feel like you were eating  it was so soft that you feel like you are imagining the food  yet the flavor is there and the taste is to die for  the ketchup in the scallops dish was quite a good addition to the meal  it was creative and impactful  the duck main dish was perfect  absolutely perfect  the sauce was quite good with it  however  i regretted not trying something more experimental for my plate  the beef plate was a huge favourite  unfortunately  too much of a favourite for there to be enough when i arrived  the fish was tender and fresh  the pigeon left me a bit confused  i didn t understand it s texture  it was extremely tender  delicious  but it left me with a confused feeling    as if i didn t feel like i was eating meat  the pork chop was to die for       by far the winner of my favourite main dish  it was tender  packed with rich flavor and well    i don t know if i have ever experienced pork chop this way before  as for the wine  the selection was great  expensive  but great  the service was good  we were there before opening  so i imagine everyone was quite new  we didn t meet the chef  and this was the greatest let down we experienced  it would have been an honor to have met him  the architecture was ok  i didn t like it too much  the light fixtures looked like bunt cake pans    the private room was great  and the walls were leather  i wish the place looked more like that  it would have been much more authentic and less     late 80s early 90s modern  the only really cool thing about the architecture was the open windowed kitchen  that was great  it was fascinating to see the chefs at work while eating  this made it feel like a lab more than anything else  reservation is a must and i believe there are no more available right now up until may  i guess you ll need some luck to get a place  i think you should go 
479	3.0	Call me oblivious, but I had no idea who Heston Blumenthal was until his name popped up in a NY Times list of places to go in 2011. I've since learned about the Fat Duck, etc., etc., so I was not totally ignorant when I walked into his new restaurant, but I didn't express any of the infantile cooing that might otherwise occur on other occasions.The meal was very good. It's possible that I'm spoiled (in fact, I am definitely spoiled, but whether this had an effect on my perception of the dinner is debatable), but the food didn't dazzle me. There were moments of awe (the baked lemon suet pudding in its caramel gooey-ness, the razor-thin rhubarb that looked like translucent sugar candy, the delightful finger limes that look like caviar and burst on your tongue like mini grapefruit, the astonishing sweetness of artichoke paired with succulent pigeon, the creamy mashed potatoes that very readily acknowledged their butter content). My companion started with the salamagundy (perfectly cooked chicken oysters, bone marrow, horseradish cream), continued with the pork chop (also perfectly cooked), and ended with the rhubarb sorbet. I had the roast scallops, spiced pigeon, and baked lemon pudding. We opted out of the tipsy cake, though the waiter did try hard to sell it to us. All in all, excellent quality, and for London the prices were not too bad. But still . . . at the end of the evening, it felt like something was missing. Had I walked in not knowing who Blumenthal was, I might have been more pleased, but my expectations were too high for what was offered.Having just read what I wrote, I think I've landed on the problem: it was perfect. Too perfect. So perfect it was boring. There was no edge, no excitement, no surprises (except perhaps the finger limes). Not that I need foam (foam is so pretentious), but there was nothing very risky about the menu. All in all, pleasant, but dull.	call me oblivious  but i had no idea who heston blumenthal was until his name popped up in a ny times list of places to go in 2011  i ve since learned about the fat duck  etc   etc   so i was not totally ignorant when i walked into his new restaurant  but i didn t express any of the infantile cooing that might otherwise occur on other occasions the meal was very good  it s possible that i m spoiled  in fact  i am definitely spoiled  but whether this had an effect on my perception of the dinner is debatable   but the food didn t dazzle me  there were moments of awe  the baked lemon suet pudding in its caramel gooey ness  the razor thin rhubarb that looked like translucent sugar candy  the delightful finger limes that look like caviar and burst on your tongue like mini grapefruit  the astonishing sweetness of artichoke paired with succulent pigeon  the creamy mashed potatoes that very readily acknowledged their butter content   my companion started with the salamagundy  perfectly cooked chicken oysters  bone marrow  horseradish cream   continued with the pork chop  also perfectly cooked   and ended with the rhubarb sorbet  i had the roast scallops  spiced pigeon  and baked lemon pudding  we opted out of the tipsy cake  though the waiter did try hard to sell it to us  all in all  excellent quality  and for london the prices were not too bad  but still       at the end of the evening  it felt like something was missing  had i walked in not knowing who blumenthal was  i might have been more pleased  but my expectations were too high for what was offered having just read what i wrote  i think i ve landed on the problem  it was perfect  too perfect  so perfect it was boring  there was no edge  no excitement  no surprises  except perhaps the finger limes   not that i need foam  foam is so pretentious   but there was nothing very risky about the menu  all in all  pleasant  but dull

The meat fruit was fabulous, which was the perfect fois gras disguised as a clementine. But the list goes on.. the best steak with triple cooked chips followed by tipsy cake (reminiscent of an upside down pineapple cake but with a Heston sensational twist).

485	4.0	Amazing. Pretty much loved everything about this meal. I had the tasting menu which seemed like a steal at 32 or so British pounds because, let's be honest, with a full week in London in store my dollars wouldn't cover the a-la-carte ordering. I had a salad with beetroot puree, goat curds, etc which was delish! The salmon for the main course that was cured in bergamot was probably the best salmon I've ever had--and I've had quite a lot. The dessert, however, was a bit disappointing. It was a prune and date tart, on which I would venture they overcooked the crust. But the little amuse bouche they gave at the end made up for it--bergamot flavored chocolate ganache w/a caraway cracker of sorts. Couple all that with a couple glasses of wine, finish off the meal w/an espresso and I was a happy lady. Highly recommended! I should have ordered the pineapple dessert a-la-carte though (some kind of sticky cake w/it), as the French women sitting at the next table were making crazy sounds while eating it.	amazing  pretty much loved everything about this meal  i had the tasting menu which seemed like a steal at 32 or so british pounds because  let s be honest  with a full week in london in store my dollars wouldn t cover the a la carte ordering  i had a salad with beetroot puree  goat curds  etc which was delish  the salmon for the main course that was cured in bergamot was probably the best salmon i ve ever had  and i ve had quite a lot  the dessert  however  was a bit disappointing  it was a prune and date tart  on which i would venture they overcooked the crust  but the little amuse bouche they gave at the end made up for it  bergamot flavored chocolate ganache w a caraway cracker of sorts  couple all that with a couple glasses of wine  finish off the meal w an espresso and i was a happy lady  highly recommended  i should have ordered the pineapple dessert a la carte though  some kind of sticky cake w it   as the french women sitting at the next table were making crazy sounds while eating it

I was prepared to really enjoy a great meal and was instead disappointed at every level. The food was bland, uninspired and, at times, completely unappealing. The presentation of the food was disjointed and wait staff seemed disinterested. The vegetable dishes lacked cohesiveness and the steak was laced with gristle and large chunks of fat. The view of the park was nice, thus the single star is merited.	i live in new york city and have traveled through out the world  i regularly patronize top restaurants at home and abroad  i was prepared to really enjoy a great meal and was instead disappointed at every level  the food was bland  uninspired and  at times  completely unappealing  the presentation of the food was disjointed and wait staff seemed disinterested  the vegetable dishes lacked cohesiveness and the steak was laced with gristle and large chunks of fat  the view of the park was nice  thus the single star is merited

488	3.0	Went to Hestons Dinner with a group of 10 people and had the private room (max seating in the main room is 8 people). Private room was lovely, overlooks the main dining area but is away from the hussle and bustle (also main restaurant was v. noisy). We were well looked after with attentive service. Started with scallops (disappointing, small and taste-less); followed by Meat-Fruit which was stunning - both in looks and taste. Shaped like a small mandarin orange it was actually filled with a delicious chicken liver pate. Followed by Turbot which was so so, then onto the famous Tipsey Cake with spit roast pineapple. Again I found this disappointing - like a runny bread & butter pudding with dull warm pineapple on the side. My friends tried the Chocolate Bar which I thought was more sucessful - dark and multi-layered.Most of the other guests were completely wowed by the food so I think it must only have been me who was under-whelmed. Sorry seems over hyped to me but worth considering for the £28.00 set lunch.	went to hestons dinner with a group of 10 people and had the private room  max seating in the main room is 8 people   private room was lovely  overlooks the main dining area but is away from the hussle and bustle  also main restaurant was v  noisy   we were well looked after with attentive service  started with scallops  disappointing  small and taste less   followed by meat fruit which was stunning   both in looks and taste  shaped like a small mandarin orange it was actually filled with a delicious chicken liver pate  followed by turbot which was so so  then onto the famous tipsey cake with spit roast pineapple  again i found this disappointing   like a runny bread   butter pudding with dull warm pineapple on the side  my friends tried the chocolate bar which i thought was more sucessful   dark and multi layered most of the other guests were completely wowed by the food so i think it must only have been me who was under whelmed  sorry seems over hyped to me but worth considering for the  28 00 set lunch 
489	3.0	Lots of wonderful things about this place- imaginative, refined, and at-play with some of the more conventional British staples (eg. an exquisite quail's scotch egg). Also: Salamagundy... (chicken liver ambrosia- for pirates). So its with surprise to assign only 3 stars... which is given with all the appreciation in the world for all the research and history on the menu. I enjoyed the kitchen (gorgeous), the wine list, flawless puddings, the wait-staff... but no wow. I suppose the concept (which I have a great deal of respect for) didn't draw me in- each dish had a 'title' and a year... but there was clearly so much more to those dishes as 'signs of the times'.... & taste alone couldn't convey. Lost in translation, I suppose, but I wanted more way-points. A solid amuse bouche & a brief conceptual orientation from the (excellent) server would have set things up nicely I expect. One also has to set the table also for a conversation, if that's what one is wanting to have, but in my impression- despite the ordination- it wasn't.	lots of wonderful things about this place  imaginative  refined  and at play with some of the more conventional british staples  eg  an exquisite quail s scotch egg   also  salamagundy     chicken liver ambrosia  for pirates   so its with surprise to assign only 3 stars    which is given with all the appreciation in the world for all the research and history on the menu  i enjoyed the kitchen  gorgeous   the wine list  flawless puddings  the wait staff    but no wow  i suppose the concept  which i have a great deal of respect for  didn t draw me in  each dish had a  title  and a year    but there was clearly so much more to those dishes as  signs of the times        taste alone couldn t convey  lost in translation  i suppose  but i wanted more way points  a solid amuse bouche   a brief conceptual orientation from the  excellent  server would have set things up nicely i expect  one also has to set the table also for a conversation  if that s what one is wanting to have  but in my impression  despite the ordination  it wasn t

The only diversion to this was the frequent sound of smashing glassware and east end babble.

At first I thought one bone was not going to be enough but it was so rich it was perfect. My friend had the meat fruit - not only gorgeous to look at, but the creamiest pate with an amazing mandarin jelly. The Beef Royale is one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten - so tender and flavourful after 72 hours of marinating. And for dessert the brown bread icecream with salted caramel was to die for, but I have to say the Tipsy Cake with roasted pineapple was even better	i wish i could give this restaurant 6 stars  the food was absolutely amazing  even better than expected  started with the roast marrow bone   rich  silky  decadent  at first i thought one bone was not going to be enough but it was so rich it was perfect  my friend had the meat fruit   not only gorgeous to look at  but the creamiest pate with an amazing mandarin jelly  the beef royale is one of the best pieces of meat i ve ever eaten   so tender and flavourful after 72 hours of marinating  and for dessert the brown bread icecream with salted caramel was to die for  but i have to say the tipsy cake with roasted pineapple was even better

For a main I had the pigeon which must have been actively trying to get away from the chef, because the meat was tough... the sign of a true athlete! The Tipsy Cake was not terribly tipsy, but yummy - a bit like brioche in rum sauce. However the roasted pineapple garnish was not worth the calories.

495	4.0	[Non-Photo Review] For full review, please click here: wp.me/pwXBH-1ag  IT'S TECHNICALLY DELICIOUS Summary:Heston Blumenthal's first London restaurant has set the UK's food media into a frenzy. And with some good reason  the food is pretty good. In a similar vein to the Fat Duck, there is a lot of work that goes into the creation of each dish  both intellectually and in terms of the technical skill required to consistently replicate each deceivingly simple dish on a much grander scale than any of his Bray outposts. The kitchen generally pulls it off, and the service seemed to be pretty spot-on when we dined there (though we were at the chef's table, so you would expect nothing less). Don't come expecting the dramatic culinary theatre that Heston is famous for at the Fat Duck  and on many of his TV programs  as the dishes here are far more straightforward in their presentation, with a few exceptions. With a windowful view of Hyde Park  thanks to the newly installed floor-to-ceiling windows  and its very own Swiss watchmaker-fashioned rotating gas-fired rotisserie for pineapples, it's definitely worth trying when in London. Much ado about something The only way I could actually score a table at what was then being billed by most as the hottest restaurant opening in London in a long time, and by some as the best new restaurant in the world (which was probably taking things a little too far), was to book the chef's table. When I enquired, I found out that there is technically no fee for booking the table, but there is a minimum spend of £900, which can be split amongst up to six guestsso definitely the more the merrier. The £150/person price, in the case of six, pays for the tasting menu, which enables you to sample much of the à la carte menu. Drinks and service will cost extra. One small point, which relates smaller people. We wanted to bring our daughter with us (who at the time was nine months old), and although this seemed to present a problem at first, the issue was eventually resolved (indeed, there had been no issue in the first place but we seemingly had been misinformed the first time around), though not without some time and effort. In any case, I will assume for the benefit of most readers that you know who Heston Blumenthal is (if not, see my previous review of his Michelin 3-star restaurant in Bray), and that you know that 'Dinner' is his first restaurant in London. You can read about the word play  a typical example of Heston's historical whimsy  on the restaurant's website or in many of the other reviews out there. Apparently, the Mandarin Oriental, in which the restaurant is housed, insisted that they use his name on the masthead, even though he personally will not be the chef at the restaurant  a fact he has been refreshingly transparent about from the beginning. Heston's right-hand man, Ashley Palmer-Watts is in charge of quite literally a small army of chefs (there are more than 40) and kitchen staff, most of whom remain cleverly shielded from the restaurant's customers, who are likely none the wiser. There are 126 covers at Dinner, which makes it by far the largest of Heston's restaurants  the Fat Duck only has about 40 covers by comparison, and his two pubs in Bray (the Hinds Head and The Crown) are also far smaller. The part of the kitchen that is visible to diners is open, though mostly covered by a sheet of glass that comes down from the ceiling. There are two large islands in the kitchen, which were custom-made by Rorgue, that utilize multi-point induction hobs. As many readers will already know, Heston is well-known for using the sous-vide (or 'water bath') method for cooking many of the proteins in his dishes, and there are correspondingly seven large built-in water baths in the main kitchen itself. There is also a Josper oven, which can reach temperatures of over 930° F, which is used for the beef dishes. In addition to all of this, there is a pastry kitchen, which is more or less hidden behind the chef's table, and there are more prep kitchens located out of site in the bowels of the hotel. The design of the restaurant is pleasant enough, without demanding your attention. But once you begin to look around, you do notice that in true Heston style, no detail in this Adam Tihany designed room has been left unconsidered. The space is very open, with high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that were newly installed with the changing of the restaurant's guard. Brown and gray hues dominate the lower reaches, with wood flooring, unadorned wooden tables, and classy cushioned banquettes. Then there are the oft-noted jelly mold (or possibly cake mold) lamps and the Swiss watchmaker Ebel-designed chrome and steel pulley-operated rotating gas fire rotisseriefor what else but pineapples. The front of house is also smartly attired in well-tailored suits and waistcoats. Being at the chef's table, we had the benefit of each course being presented by the head chef himself. The table	 non photo review  for full review  please click here  wp me pwxbh 1ag  it s technically delicious summary heston blumenthal s first london restaurant has set the uk s food media into a frenzy  and with some good reason  the food is pretty good  in a similar vein to the fat duck  there is a lot of work that goes into the creation of each dish  both intellectually and in terms of the technical skill required to consistently replicate each deceivingly simple dish on a much grander scale than any of his bray outposts  the kitchen generally pulls it off  and the service seemed to be pretty spot on when we dined there  though we were at the chef s table  so you would expect nothing less   don t come expecting the dramatic culinary theatre that heston is famous for at the fat duck  and on many of his tv programs  as the dishes here are far more straightforward in their presentation  with a few exceptions  with a windowful view of hyde park  thanks to the newly installed floor to ceiling windows  and its very own swiss watchmaker fashioned rotating gas fired rotisserie for pineapples  it s definitely worth trying when in london  much ado about something the only way i could actually score a table at what was then being billed by most as the hottest restaurant opening in london in a long time  and by some as the best new restaurant in the world  which was probably taking things a little too far   was to book the chef s table  when i enquired  i found out that there is technically no fee for booking the table  but there is a minimum spend of  900  which can be split amongst up to six guestsso definitely the more the merrier  the  150 person price  in the case of six  pays for the tasting menu  which enables you to sample much of the   la carte menu  drinks and service will cost extra  one small point  which relates smaller people  we wanted to bring our daughter with us  who at the time was nine months old   and although this seemed to present a problem at first  the issue was eventually resolved  indeed  there had been no issue in the first place but we seemingly had been misinformed the first time around   though not without some time and effort  in any case  i will assume for the benefit of most readers that you know who heston blumenthal is  if not  see my previous review of his michelin 3 star restaurant in bray   and that you know that  dinner  is his first restaurant in london  you can read about the word play  a typical example of heston s historical whimsy  on the restaurant s website or in many of the other reviews out there  apparently  the mandarin oriental  in which the restaurant is housed  insisted that they use his name on the masthead  even though he personally will not be the chef at the restaurant  a fact he has been refreshingly transparent about from the beginning  heston s right hand man  ashley palmer watts is in charge of quite literally a small army of chefs  there are more than 40  and kitchen staff  most of whom remain cleverly shielded from the restaurant s customers  who are likely none the wiser  there are 126 covers at dinner  which makes it by far the largest of heston s restaurants  the fat duck only has about 40 covers by comparison  and his two pubs in bray  the hinds head and the crown  are also far smaller  the part of the kitchen that is visible to diners is open  though mostly covered by a sheet of glass that comes down from the ceiling  there are two large islands in the kitchen  which were custom made by rorgue  that utilize multi point induction hobs  as many readers will already know  heston is well known for using the sous vide  or  water bath   method for cooking many of the proteins in his dishes  and there are correspondingly seven large built in water baths in the main kitchen itself  there is also a josper oven  which can reach temperatures of over 930  f  which is used for the beef dishes  in addition to all of this  there is a pastry kitchen  which is more or less hidden behind the chef s table  and there are more prep kitchens located out of site in the bowels of the hotel  the design of the restaurant is pleasant enough  without demanding your attention  but once you begin to look around  you do notice that in true heston style  no detail in this adam tihany designed room has been left unconsidered  the space is very open  with high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows that were newly installed with the changing of the restaurant s guard  brown and gray hues dominate the lower reaches  with wood flooring  unadorned wooden tables  and classy cushioned banquettes  then there are the oft noted jelly mold  or possibly cake mold  lamps and the swiss watchmaker ebel designed chrome and steel pulley operated rotating gas fire rotisseriefor what else but pineapples  the front of house is also smartly attired in well tailored suits and waistcoats  being at the chef s table  we had the benefit of each course being presented by the head chef himself  the table
496	1.0	"oh dear! oh dear! oh dear! Just returned from lunch at Dinner. Very dissappointed. The service was soooo slow. Felt totally ignored for far too long. The dishes came out and sat on a table next to us while we waited for the ""waiter"" to come past to place it in front of us! The food was BELOW average. The wines by the glass left alot to be desired. The famous chicken liver mousse ""meat fruit"" starter was bland to say the least. My partners ""rice and flesh"" was even worse. The rice being undercooked, and having waited so long to be served, had developed a film on top! The main of beef for two was so fatty and underwhelming that we did not finish it. This is saying alot considering my partner is a self confessed beef addict! To add insult to injury, the portion of mushroom ketchup was tiny.The sides of triple cooked fries and black cabbage were far too salty. The mixed leaf salad beyond boring.Trying to cheer ourselves up we looked forward to the dessert. Having read the reviews, ""tipsy cake"" was a no brainer. Wish i hadnt bothered!A brioche in a syrup with a tiny sliver of grilled pineapple on the side. What is the fuss about?!All in all, our meal here was a diabolical dissapointment. Reminded us of how we felt when we left the Fat Duck a few years ago! No more Heston for us thats for sure!"	oh dear  oh dear  oh dear  just returned from lunch at dinner  very dissappointed  the service was soooo slow  felt totally ignored for far too long  the dishes came out and sat on a table next to us while we waited for the  waiter  to come past to place it in front of us  the food was below average  the wines by the glass left alot to be desired  the famous chicken liver mousse  meat fruit  starter was bland to say the least  my partners  rice and flesh  was even worse  the rice being undercooked  and having waited so long to be served  had developed a film on top  the main of beef for two was so fatty and underwhelming that we did not finish it  this is saying alot considering my partner is a self confessed beef addict  to add insult to injury  the portion of mushroom ketchup was tiny the sides of triple cooked fries and black cabbage were far too salty  the mixed leaf salad beyond boring trying to cheer ourselves up we looked forward to the dessert  having read the reviews   tipsy cake  was a no brainer  wish i hadnt bothered a brioche in a syrup with a tiny sliver of grilled pineapple on the side  what is the fuss about  all in all  our meal here was a diabolical dissapointment  reminded us of how we felt when we left the fat duck a few years ago  no more heston for us thats for sure

498	3.0	Very California vibes with the decor and background music. It was visually appealing just like their food. Unfortunately, their food wasn't as good as it looked. The pancake looked fluffy and light, but it was dense and chewy. The bacon was real meat which made it better, but my friend would have preferred it a little more cooked. The chicken and waffles were probably the best thing on our table with a perfect poached egg that was yolky. This wasn't the best meal of our trip, but it sufficed.	very california vibes with the decor and background music  it was visually appealing just like their food  unfortunately  their food wasn t as good as it looked  the pancake looked fluffy and light  but it was dense and chewy  the bacon was real meat which made it better  but my friend would have preferred it a little more cooked  the chicken and waffles were probably the best thing on our table with a perfect poached egg that was yolky  this wasn t the best meal of our trip  but it sufficed 
499	3.0	Great news everyone. I can save you time and money. Time by only forcing you to read a few words instead of my usual long-winded reviews.The ambiance was awesome, our server was really great... although it was my first proper English girl, so I am assuming I was simply smitten by the accent. However, she was great. Wish I could remember her name.First and last traditional English breakfast. Not good. Don't get it, but I know that I had to do it at least once. No redeeming quality of this breakfast (this is more a comment on all places that serve this and less on the Breakfast Club). Don't get it... keep it England it is all yours.THE VERDICT:We waited in line for this place and I am assuming it is just a tourist trap because... I did not get it because anywhere that serves English food isn't the best. However, ambiance was cool and servers were cool so... if that is worth like 20 american dollars to you... well, go for it. Otherwise... pass. (a 1-star bump for exceptional service).	great news everyone  i can save you time and money  time by only forcing you to read a few words instead of my usual long winded reviews the ambiance was awesome  our server was really great    although it was my first proper english girl  so i am assuming i was simply smitten by the accent  however  she was great  wish i could remember her name first and last traditional english breakfast  not good  don t get it  but i know that i had to do it at least once  no redeeming quality of this breakfast  this is more a comment on all places that serve this and less on the breakfast club   don t get it    keep it england it is all yours the verdict we waited in line for this place and i am assuming it is just a tourist trap because    i did not get it because anywhere that serves english food isn t the best  however  ambiance was cool and servers were cool so    if that is worth like 20 american dollars to you    well  go for it  otherwise    pass   a 1 star bump for exceptional service  
500	4.0	American here:Solid stop for breakfast. Their portions are just over perfect (read: you won't leave hungry). I also have gluten and dairy allergies and I'm very happy.1. Their oatmilk porridge was great - ask for extra oatmilk2. Their gluten free pancakes are ok (heavy/slightly tough) but topped with tasty fruits3. Their side of bacon and sausage are big portions. Should have chosen just the bacon since we couldn't finish4. The side avocado comes out as really cold guacamole. For breakfast it was not what we wanted. But would go great with lunch foods 5. I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. I drink it black so it tasted almost citrusy. Turned it around by adding in the extra oatmilk we had :)6. Staff and greeter chef guy were super nice.Would come here again. PS. Grab a pin before you leave!	american here solid stop for breakfast  their portions are just over perfect  read  you won t leave hungry   i also have gluten and dairy allergies and i m very happy 1  their oatmilk porridge was great   ask for extra oatmilk2  their gluten free pancakes are ok  heavy slightly tough  but topped with tasty fruits3  their side of bacon and sausage are big portions  should have chosen just the bacon since we couldn t finish4  the side avocado comes out as really cold guacamole  for breakfast it was not what we wanted  but would go great with lunch foods 5  i wasn t a big fan of the coffee  i drink it black so it tasted almost citrusy  turned it around by adding in the extra oatmilk we had   6  staff and greeter chef guy were super nice would come here again  ps  grab a pin before you leave

The place drove you back in the 90s and they always play great tunes.Unfortunately they don't take reservations in the weekend and you may queue for a while.	this is probably my favorite place for brunch  you can choose between a variety of savory plates as well as sweet and delicious pancakes and milkshakes  the place drove you back in the 90s and they always play great tunes unfortunately they don t take reservations in the weekend and you may queue for a while

The only thing I would give a good review to we staff, they are very nice though completely run off their feet.  We ordered the salt beef Reuben and the shakshuka Benny with fries. I've had shakshuka many times, especially travelling as been to quite a few Israeli place and it's amazing... when cooked right. This wasn't, the flavour was horrible and to top it off...ALL the food was COLD. My husband and I only ate the meteocre Reuben (bread was nice) only because we waited so long and was starving! Fries COLD. Stay away and save your money.	touist trap  save your money  waited 40 min for food just to be completely disappointed  the only thing i would give a good review to we staff  they are very nice though completely run off their feet   we ordered the salt beef reuben and the shakshuka benny with fries  i ve had shakshuka many times  especially travelling as been to quite a few israeli place and it s amazing    when cooked right  this wasn t  the flavour was horrible and to top it off   all the food was cold  my husband and i only ate the meteocre reuben  bread was nice  only because we waited so long and was starving  fries cold  stay away and save your money

Unfortunate because I heard rave reviews about this place and the man seating us seemed to have an attitude with everything he said.Had to cancel my pancakes because I'm sure those would have been cold as well. This place may be too busy for their own good and the food seems to sit a while before it's ran out.	got the chorizo eggs benedict and it was cold  got the hot chocolate and it was cold  the marshmallows are still unmelted in my cup as i type this  unfortunate because i heard rave reviews about this place and the man seating us seemed to have an attitude with everything he said had to cancel my pancakes because i m sure those would have been cold as well  this place may be too busy for their own good and the food seems to sit a while before it s ran out

The band was fun and extremely appropriate to get the night going. I always love the positive funk energy that's at the Old Street store. On the Friday night I was in their new little ""cubbyhouse"" section drink a great selection of gin cocktails (during happy hour they're £5! - happy house is from 5pm - 7pm) along with a big bowel of fries. The Breakfast Club is definitely not a place for a quiet night. It's always busy, loud and happening.

507	5.0	"What a lovely place to be! I found this restaurant before coming to London, in case the hotel I'm staying doesn't provide the best breakfast. I need a good breakfast to pump up my energy and keep me up. Since they open at 8 AM, I came here a little bit before 8 to look at the place. I was greeted by Lauren, a nice lovely host and waitress. I was seated by the window overlooking the street. Nothing's going on outside the street at this hour. I ordered coffee, of course. She brought me coffee with a very CUTE cup! Woohoo! Loved this cup and of course I forgot to purchase it. Good thing she's very knowledgeable about their menu. When I tried to order a plate that seems offer avocado, which I like, she explained to me about the portion and what else comes with the dish. She's right to recommend me another breakfast plate that also comes with avocado and poached eggs. Since I told her that I could be allergic to some seeds, my breakfast came with a regular white bread. It's better to be safe than sorry during my travel. I got my breakfast with sunflower seeds on the side, which was safe for me to eat. The breakfast is a must-have dish! Btw, the coffee was amazing! Nice rich coffee, I loved it! Try this and you won't be disappointed. I am so pleased with Lauren's best treatment. She took great care of me. I thought it's because I was the first customer that morning but she said ""it's nice to have a nice warm customer to start a day!"" (something like that). It made me cry! I thought she's nice from the beginning and didn't realize she was thinking the same thing about me. In this city, not only that I won't go hungry, but I wasn't abandoned and ignored! The restaurant is pretty big for a breakfast place, could probably accommodate up to 30 people maybe? Very colorful place, which is perfect for my personality and what I enjoy. Life is colorful! Embrace it! I actually came back later that afternoon to try and purchase their t-shirt for Hubby because I liked the wordings. Unfortunately they ran out of his size. Too bad I don't wear t-shirts. Highly recommended place to enjoy your breakfast! Thanks to Lauren for her brilliant recommendation and her persona. Thanks the Club for adding more smiles on my face! *:)"	what a lovely place to be  i found this restaurant before coming to london  in case the hotel i m staying doesn t provide the best breakfast  i need a good breakfast to pump up my energy and keep me up  since they open at 8 am  i came here a little bit before 8 to look at the place  i was greeted by lauren  a nice lovely host and waitress  i was seated by the window overlooking the street  nothing s going on outside the street at this hour  i ordered coffee  of course  she brought me coffee with a very cute cup  woohoo  loved this cup and of course i forgot to purchase it  good thing she s very knowledgeable about their menu  when i tried to order a plate that seems offer avocado  which i like  she explained to me about the portion and what else comes with the dish  she s right to recommend me another breakfast plate that also comes with avocado and poached eggs  since i told her that i could be allergic to some seeds  my breakfast came with a regular white bread  it s better to be safe than sorry during my travel  i got my breakfast with sunflower seeds on the side  which was safe for me to eat  the breakfast is a must have dish  btw  the coffee was amazing  nice rich coffee  i loved it  try this and you won t be disappointed  i am so pleased with lauren s best treatment  she took great care of me  i thought it s because i was the first customer that morning but she said  it s nice to have a nice warm customer to start a day    something like that   it made me cry  i thought she s nice from the beginning and didn t realize she was thinking the same thing about me  in this city  not only that i won t go hungry  but i wasn t abandoned and ignored  the restaurant is pretty big for a breakfast place  could probably accommodate up to 30 people maybe  very colorful place  which is perfect for my personality and what i enjoy  life is colorful  embrace it  i actually came back later that afternoon to try and purchase their t shirt for hubby because i liked the wordings  unfortunately they ran out of his size  too bad i don t wear t shirts  highly recommended place to enjoy your breakfast  thanks to lauren for her brilliant recommendation and her persona  thanks the club for adding more smiles on my face

509	3.0	Disappointed! Had super high expectations and was craving a bomb brekky but the service was super slow, the pancakes were dry, and they forgot our cappuccino order. The menu is pretty extensive but they have nothing super special or exotic. The waffles were average, as the banana wasn't caramelized. Felt like I could make any of these things at home for a fraction of the price and wait. They were also out of orange juice at 10am. It was fine but wouldn't recommend it to a friend.	disappointed  had super high expectations and was craving a bomb brekky but the service was super slow  the pancakes were dry  and they forgot our cappuccino order  the menu is pretty extensive but they have nothing super special or exotic  the waffles were average  as the banana wasn t caramelized  felt like i could make any of these things at home for a fraction of the price and wait  they were also out of orange juice at 10am  it was fine but wouldn t recommend it to a friend 
510	4.0	Ate here while on vacation in London. We ran across this place while looking for a Banksy bit. I had the pancakes and bacon. It was a welcomed change of pace from what I had been eating the past few days around London. Reminded me of what I would eat at home(Alabama). The waiters were all nice - we sat at the community table. I know that because we were at that table any of the waiters could help out but it was fun talking to them after they would hear our accents and start a conversation about everything from the weather outside to my phone cover. It's a pretty hip place but very approachable even if you aren't!	ate here while on vacation in london  we ran across this place while looking for a banksy bit  i had the pancakes and bacon  it was a welcomed change of pace from what i had been eating the past few days around london  reminded me of what i would eat at home alabama   the waiters were all nice   we sat at the community table  i know that because we were at that table any of the waiters could help out but it was fun talking to them after they would hear our accents and start a conversation about everything from the weather outside to my phone cover  it s a pretty hip place but very approachable even if you aren t

I ordered the Full Monty breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, tomato, toast, baked beans, and black pudding. Not exactly ""American"" per se, but plenty greasy. It was enjoyable and a good approximation for the diner food back in the States. The restaurant itself has a cool, kitschy decor and atmosphere. Laid back, but not trashy. The staff was friendly. If I were a local, I'd probably come here pretty often. It seems like a good place for casual meals with friends. It's also located in a good spot with easy access to a variety of bars and cafes. Not mind-blowing, but definitely recommended."	after a few days wandering the streets of london  i had a nostalgic hankering for some good ole fashioned greasy american food  this place seemed like a good option  i ordered the full monty breakfast with scrambled eggs  bacon  tomato  toast  baked beans  and black pudding  not exactly  american  per se  but plenty greasy  it was enjoyable and a good approximation for the diner food back in the states  the restaurant itself has a cool  kitschy decor and atmosphere  laid back  but not trashy  the staff was friendly  if i were a local  i d probably come here pretty often  it seems like a good place for casual meals with friends  it s also located in a good spot with easy access to a variety of bars and cafes  not mind blowing  but definitely recommended

The waitress who showed was in was impatient and not really polite when we wanted to change seats as the chairs were wet, but then again, the place was packed and we should look appreciative that we got a seat.I ordered the Chicken & Waffles and it looked fantastic. The chicken was a little overcooked and the meat was a little dry and the chicken was bland borrowing Flavours from the batter. Maybe I am Spoilt with the chicken and waffles in Brooklyn and LA, this dish would get only 2 stars but I would give this place a slightly higher rating due to the nice interior and ambience....and maybe lose the hipster waitress who had one French fry too many.	it doesn t get anything more hipster in shoreditch as the breakfast club  cool cafe with loud music with hip waitresses  this place is tastefully designed as a happy fun place to eat  the waitress who showed was in was impatient and not really polite when we wanted to change seats as the chairs were wet  but then again  the place was packed and we should look appreciative that we got a seat i ordered the chicken   waffles and it looked fantastic  the chicken was a little overcooked and the meat was a little dry and the chicken was bland borrowing flavours from the batter  maybe i am spoilt with the chicken and waffles in brooklyn and la  this dish would get only 2 stars but i would give this place a slightly higher rating due to the nice interior and ambience    and maybe lose the hipster waitress who had one french fry too many 
516	4.0	I've not been to BC in the evening before so I'm not sure if it is generally a more quiet branch or if its just the Hoxton location.We arrived just before 7 and it was still quite quiet with lots of tables free. Even on a Friday they have a happy hour 5-7 - all cocktails £5 and they are yuuuum cocktails! They aren't your bog standard mojito or Cosmo. Full of flavours, something a bit different but are just served in normal cocktail glasses with no extravagance or quirky extras like you see in LCC or Experimental Cocktail Club.Unfortunately they had run out of the short rib and goats cheese fries but the chilli fries were a good replacement - plenty of chilli but perhaps not cheesy enough for me. The main however was the real icing on the cake - waffles with fried chicken, gravy and maple syrup. It was sooo good - chicken good, waffle lovely and soft, gravy thick and well flavoured. I cannot recommend this dish enough. There was also plenty of other choices on the menu if this isn't your thing. One a month they also have live music (which I don't think they advertise on their website - shame) which starts at about 8 on their small stage in the far side of the restaurant. Such a nice idea and great for a little dance after some food and with your drink!	i ve not been to bc in the evening before so i m not sure if it is generally a more quiet branch or if its just the hoxton location we arrived just before 7 and it was still quite quiet with lots of tables free  even on a friday they have a happy hour 5 7   all cocktails  5 and they are yuuuum cocktails  they aren t your bog standard mojito or cosmo  full of flavours  something a bit different but are just served in normal cocktail glasses with no extravagance or quirky extras like you see in lcc or experimental cocktail club unfortunately they had run out of the short rib and goats cheese fries but the chilli fries were a good replacement   plenty of chilli but perhaps not cheesy enough for me  the main however was the real icing on the cake   waffles with fried chicken  gravy and maple syrup  it was sooo good   chicken good  waffle lovely and soft  gravy thick and well flavoured  i cannot recommend this dish enough  there was also plenty of other choices on the menu if this isn t your thing  one a month they also have live music  which i don t think they advertise on their website   shame  which starts at about 8 on their small stage in the far side of the restaurant  such a nice idea and great for a little dance after some food and with your drink 
517	3.0	Yeahhhhh, if you're going to boast a bright and cheery breakfast spot, the staff better catch the vibe.We are regulars at this particular Breakfast Club. I'd never que in the weekend morning rush, but we often find ourselves here for lunch, midweek breakfast, early dinners, coffee with friends, etc. We come often. We tip. We are polite. We spend a lot of money because I really like breakfast stuff. Usually the service is pretty good (I actually can't remember a time it wasn't) -- but last night (Sunday the 26th October) our service was perfunctory at best, bordering on super rude. I still don't actually know why. We brought our 8 month old to eat with us (it was 530pm on a Sunday). We didn't bring a huge buggy, he sat in my lap. He was not allowed to play with anything on the table. We did not order him specific off menu things to eat. He likes the loud 80's/90's music. All in all, it was barely as if he was there -- but my feeling was that the bad service was because of him, or that this chick really just has an axe to grind with life. Either way -- I'm not a fan of that BS. Get a grip or get a job outside of the service industry. We finally just had to get up and walk to the counter to get the bill and leave (the restaurant was about quarter to half full). Right from the time we started ordering we felt like we were a bother and almost defensively had to answer questions. Really weird. Super disappointing in a place where we've come many, many times over the years f or a good meal since we've lived near Hoxton Square. The food is fine, but not good enough to mask bad service. It'll be a long while before I return, if ever.	yeahhhhh  if you re going to boast a bright and cheery breakfast spot  the staff better catch the vibe we are regulars at this particular breakfast club  i d never que in the weekend morning rush  but we often find ourselves here for lunch  midweek breakfast  early dinners  coffee with friends  etc  we come often  we tip  we are polite  we spend a lot of money because i really like breakfast stuff  usually the service is pretty good  i actually can t remember a time it wasn t     but last night  sunday the 26th october  our service was perfunctory at best  bordering on super rude  i still don t actually know why  we brought our 8 month old to eat with us  it was 530pm on a sunday   we didn t bring a huge buggy  he sat in my lap  he was not allowed to play with anything on the table  we did not order him specific off menu things to eat  he likes the loud 80 s 90 s music  all in all  it was barely as if he was there    but my feeling was that the bad service was because of him  or that this chick really just has an axe to grind with life  either way    i m not a fan of that bs  get a grip or get a job outside of the service industry  we finally just had to get up and walk to the counter to get the bill and leave  the restaurant was about quarter to half full   right from the time we started ordering we felt like we were a bother and almost defensively had to answer questions  really weird  super disappointing in a place where we ve come many  many times over the years f or a good meal since we ve lived near hoxton square  the food is fine  but not good enough to mask bad service  it ll be a long while before i return  if ever

This part of London is bursting with great cafes, amazing brunch spots and ridiculously good value greasy spoons. Walk on to ozone coffee, around the corner to friends of ours. 5 more minutes to one Jamie Oliver's favourite all day breakfast - the shepherdess cafe, etc.On an on and on. Skip the crazy queue and get a better meal!	i don t get the hype of any of the breakfast clubs   i ve been here several times and while it s not bad  it s just not great  this part of london is bursting with great cafes  amazing brunch spots and ridiculously good value greasy spoons  walk on to ozone coffee  around the corner to friends of ours  5 more minutes to one jamie oliver s favourite all day breakfast   the shepherdess cafe  etc on an on and on  skip the crazy queue and get a better meal

I didn't really have much voice after the madness of karaoke and drinking the previous evening...but this breakfast made me sufficiently full of energy to make it home to my kitten, fiancée and recovery cuddles. Phew.I like:- The décor and ambience - the loo wallpaper is awesome!- My yummy eggs with chorizo (I have no idea what it was called, but it made me happy)- Tea in smiling mugs- One of the waiters took a photo of us all...he turned the camera around and took a photo with himself in...plus another waitress ran across the room to photo-bomb it. I approve of slightly-crazy, friendly staff.I didn't like:- My first tea came in a mug with lipstick mark (I wasn't wearing lipstick so it was obviously not washed- *gross*!) - The line as we left was huuuge. So yay! I like this place, and I'd come back if I am ever in the area early...but I don't think I like it enough to queue if I arrive later in the day.	yelp doesn t really need another review for the breakfast club   but they fed me and brought me back to life when i was very hungover and in desperately need of tea   so they really deserve my four stars i rocked up here with the surviving girls on the morning after my hen party  i didn t really have much voice after the madness of karaoke and drinking the previous evening   but this breakfast made me sufficiently full of energy to make it home to my kitten  fianc e and recovery cuddles  phew i like   the d cor and ambience   the loo wallpaper is awesome   my yummy eggs with chorizo  i have no idea what it was called  but it made me happy   tea in smiling mugs  one of the waiters took a photo of us all   he turned the camera around and took a photo with himself in   plus another waitress ran across the room to photo bomb it  i approve of slightly crazy  friendly staff i didn t like   my first tea came in a mug with lipstick mark  i wasn t wearing lipstick so it was obviously not washed   gross      the line as we left was huuuge  so yay  i like this place  and i d come back if i am ever in the area early   but i don t think i like it enough to queue if i arrive later in the day

522	2.0	I went in for a late lunch on my own. Having been uninspired by the breakfast at another branch, I decided to plump for lunch-style food.I was seated quickly (the restaurant was pretty empty at 3pm on a weekday) and my order was taken promptly. I went for a pulled chicken sandwich, poutine, and a coke.My food came pretty quickly and looked good but, eww, it was not. The chicken sandwich was tasty for the first few bites, until I bit into a hunk of what I think was bone - put me right off. The chips? Crunchy and tasty with nice gravy and then WTF IS THIS ABOMINATION OF CHEESE? I thought at first it was mozzarella pearls but upon tasting, it was some kind of goats cheese. It just made no sense and was not what I was expecting.Then the service went downhill. I waited 10 minutes with dirty dishes and no service - and I just wanted to leave, to be honest. Even though my plates were about 90% full, there was no query about my food and as it was only about £11, I just paid and left.Oh, and ETA - I see from the previous review that they ran out of orange juice. They were out today, too.

Look at the pictures to see yourself! The picture I took shows a ""Full Monthy"" plate, which is also available in a smaller version (i.e. with less ingredients) that is called ""The Half Monthy"". The plate is very rich and it's really worth a shot. Price is 10.5 for the full version and 8.5£ for the ""half"" version, which is not ""half"" a plate but just a less challenging one.They have juices in their menu just as it should be for a brunch. Unfortunately they ran out of orange juice and we had to take a smoothie, but it was good too. Since it took a bit to have it served, the restaurant offered the whole pitcher for free. This is a great service!In a few words, the price was good, the service great, the restaurant nicely decorated.I would totally recommend this place for a brunch."	this is a very nice breakfast oriented restaurant brunch is the main focus here and i loved it i couldn t take a picture of the menu but they have some nice ideas to make up a rich brunch plate  look at the pictures to see yourself  the picture i took shows a  full monthy  plate  which is also available in a smaller version  i e  with less ingredients  that is called  the half monthy   the plate is very rich and it s really worth a shot  price is 10 5 for the full version and 8 5  for the  half  version  which is not  half  a plate but just a less challenging one they have juices in their menu just as it should be for a brunch  unfortunately they ran out of orange juice and we had to take a smoothie  but it was good too  since it took a bit to have it served  the restaurant offered the whole pitcher for free  this is a great service in a few words  the price was good  the service great  the restaurant nicely decorated i would totally recommend this place for a brunch 
524	3.0	I tried the club for the first time today and although I enjoyed my breakfast burrito more than I had expected being from California and quite the snob when it comes to both breakfast and Mexican-style fare, I was disappointed to find that against my mentioning it several times that I was allergic to avocado and therefore guacamole and even asking if there was any in my meal, being told no - that I arrived back at work with my takeout to find the green chunky paste both inside and on the side of my meal. Let me reiterate that this isn't a preference but a health issue as I am allergic (trust me, as a native Californian, I know how unfortunate that is). As I didn't have time to go back and exchange the meal and wait another 10+ minutes for scrambled eggs to be tossed in a tortilla - I had to forego lunch today after two bites. Willing to give it another go, but not unless they learn how to take notes in the POS system or make sure someone reads them / quality control. Maybe I'll go for a pancake or something less complicated.	i tried the club for the first time today and although i enjoyed my breakfast burrito more than i had expected being from california and quite the snob when it comes to both breakfast and mexican style fare  i was disappointed to find that against my mentioning it several times that i was allergic to avocado and therefore guacamole and even asking if there was any in my meal  being told no   that i arrived back at work with my takeout to find the green chunky paste both inside and on the side of my meal  let me reiterate that this isn t a preference but a health issue as i am allergic  trust me  as a native californian  i know how unfortunate that is   as i didn t have time to go back and exchange the meal and wait another 10  minutes for scrambled eggs to be tossed in a tortilla   i had to forego lunch today after two bites  willing to give it another go  but not unless they learn how to take notes in the pos system or make sure someone reads them   quality control  maybe i ll go for a pancake or something less complicated

526	4.0	This is my second visit to Breakfast Club and what a joy it is. I always leave this place in a food coma state. First time I went, was in a group, and don't remember the food taking too long to come. I ordered the club sandwich which had chicken, which was not a disappointment at all! I also ordered the green smoothie but felt the mint was too powerful in it although it did leave me with fresh breath!Second visit,God suggested  I try the Buttermilk fried chicken with chips...I was about to until my mum picked it and because we did not want to eat the same thing I let her have it. So I picked the Big Bad Burrito with the choice of pork. It was big and bad but was not as great as the Buttermilk fried chicken that I got a taste of which was devinnnneeee!!!  I also ordered the Mango Go smoothie which had mango,strawberry and apple. To my disappointment it did not look and taste like a mango it looked more strawberry and tasted like a strawberry with sharp apple taste.To finish off we managed to squeeze in a pancakes with berries, maple syrup and vanilla cream. Again pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious with the extra accessories.I like Breakfast Club vibe, and their playlist! The service was great on both occasions and did not have to wait too long for our food. I'm not always in this side of town, but when I come here next I will try what they are known for....Breakfast!	this is my second visit to breakfast club and what a joy it is  i always leave this place in a food coma state  first time i went  was in a group  and don t remember the food taking too long to come  i ordered the club sandwich which had chicken  which was not a disappointment at all  i also ordered the green smoothie but felt the mint was too powerful in it although it did leave me with fresh breath second visit god suggested  i try the buttermilk fried chicken with chips   i was about to until my mum picked it and because we did not want to eat the same thing i let her have it  so i picked the big bad burrito with the choice of pork  it was big and bad but was not as great as the buttermilk fried chicken that i got a taste of which was devinnnneeee     i also ordered the mango go smoothie which had mango strawberry and apple  to my disappointment it did not look and taste like a mango it looked more strawberry and tasted like a strawberry with sharp apple taste to finish off we managed to squeeze in a pancakes with berries  maple syrup and vanilla cream  again pancakes were light and fluffy and delicious with the extra accessories i like breakfast club vibe  and their playlist  the service was great on both occasions and did not have to wait too long for our food  i m not always in this side of town  but when i come here next i will try what they are known for    breakfast 
527	2.0	I don't know where to start with this review as I hate to write a bad one! Unfortunately, my most recent visit to The Breakfast Club in Hoxton was a disaster. It was a quiet Sunday night and their card machine was broken, announced a sign on their door. Absolutely not their fault and easily overcome with a quick trip to the cash machine. I imagine at least partly due to this there was only one couple dining when we arrived, in the whole of the usually jam packed restaurant! Despite this, staff were pretty slow to move and greet us. That kind of set the standard. The food order was taken without hiccup & my small human was going to share the hummus and halloumi wrap, original poutine and the short rib & goats cheese topped fries with me. When the food arrived after a 25+ minute wait (we were the only table in there at this point!) I was so sure they'd got my order wrong I actually complained to the waitress. The short rib & goat cheese fries contained zero visible goats cheese whereas the poutine was covered in it. I see now from other reviews that actually, for some reason, that's just how they choose to ruin their poutine! The chips were topped with what I'd have sworn was the goats cheese and should have been on the rib topped fries. The super soft, tangy cheese under the gravy just didn't work in the slightest and I was unable to eat them. The rib fries were good but would have been complimented with some crumbled goats cheese on top. The waitress assured me it was mixed in with the meat but the BBQ sauce entirely overpowered it if that were the case. The wrap was tasty but the halloumi hadn't been grilled enough for my tastes. The wrap basically gets the second star, as it certainly wasn't the service or any of the other food! While there a couple arrived to be seated and neither of the two waitresses or the barman moved to seat them. They were sat on their phones or laptop the entire time and told the customers to pick up their own menus and choose a table while they sat motionless at the bar, hardly a warm welcoming service! I'll not return again, two bad experiences on my last two visits to the place. Disappointing.	i don t know where to start with this review as i hate to write a bad one  unfortunately  my most recent visit to the breakfast club in hoxton was a disaster  it was a quiet sunday night and their card machine was broken  announced a sign on their door  absolutely not their fault and easily overcome with a quick trip to the cash machine  i imagine at least partly due to this there was only one couple dining when we arrived  in the whole of the usually jam packed restaurant  despite this  staff were pretty slow to move and greet us  that kind of set the standard  the food order was taken without hiccup   my small human was going to share the hummus and halloumi wrap  original poutine and the short rib   goats cheese topped fries with me  when the food arrived after a 25  minute wait  we were the only table in there at this point   i was so sure they d got my order wrong i actually complained to the waitress  the short rib   goat cheese fries contained zero visible goats cheese whereas the poutine was covered in it  i see now from other reviews that actually  for some reason  that s just how they choose to ruin their poutine  the chips were topped with what i d have sworn was the goats cheese and should have been on the rib topped fries  the super soft  tangy cheese under the gravy just didn t work in the slightest and i was unable to eat them  the rib fries were good but would have been complimented with some crumbled goats cheese on top  the waitress assured me it was mixed in with the meat but the bbq sauce entirely overpowered it if that were the case  the wrap was tasty but the halloumi hadn t been grilled enough for my tastes  the wrap basically gets the second star  as it certainly wasn t the service or any of the other food  while there a couple arrived to be seated and neither of the two waitresses or the barman moved to seat them  they were sat on their phones or laptop the entire time and told the customers to pick up their own menus and choose a table while they sat motionless at the bar  hardly a warm welcoming service  i ll not return again  two bad experiences on my last two visits to the place  disappointing

I wanted to go for some time and it did not disappoint me at all!We went there at breakfast time and we did not have to queue (yeah, lucky us). As you might know, the place is really easygoing and trendy. We got a nice table with a really cute tablecloth (full of sunflowers!). We took a look at the menu and Mamma Mia! It was like heaven! I did not know what to choose so I opted for one of my favourite breakfast dishes: Eggs Benedict. Yummi x100! The sauce was AMAZING and the little muffins underneath so fluffy and delicious. We ordered home-fries on the side (of course). We also got pancakes and Homemade yogurt with fruit and mint (really refreshing). We needed a healthier option after all these comfort food. The pancakes were to-die-for; with some kind of Vanilla cream on top.The coffees were really good as well, specially Cappuccino.

539	4.0	I was staying in the area for a couple days and yelped breakfast and this place popped up. The rating and reviews were solid so I decided to see for myself. I came on a Saturday morning and there was a line but since I was alone I didn't have to really wait in it. I can be indecisive so I didn't really know what to order. I decided on the All American breakfast because I felt that was a safe choice. The All American comes with bacon, pancakes, eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Everything was really good BUT the pancakes. Yikes! They were so flavorless and mushy tasting. The tasty syrup couldn't even save them. I finished them because I don't like leaving food on my plate. I'm still giving this place four stars cause the service was good and everything else besides the pancakes tasted nice. However, it's not hard to mess up bacon, eggs, sausage, and potatoes and I thought pancakes too! But I was wrong. I would still come back here if I'm in London again but will try something else.	i was staying in the area for a couple days and yelped breakfast and this place popped up  the rating and reviews were solid so i decided to see for myself  i came on a saturday morning and there was a line but since i was alone i didn t have to really wait in it  i can be indecisive so i didn t really know what to order  i decided on the all american breakfast because i felt that was a safe choice  the all american comes with bacon  pancakes  eggs  sausage  and potatoes  everything was really good but the pancakes  yikes  they were so flavorless and mushy tasting  the tasty syrup couldn t even save them  i finished them because i don t like leaving food on my plate  i m still giving this place four stars cause the service was good and everything else besides the pancakes tasted nice  however  it s not hard to mess up bacon  eggs  sausage  and potatoes and i thought pancakes too  but i was wrong  i would still come back here if i m in london again but will try something else

You wouldn't catch me anywhere else on a Saturday or Sunday when I was trying to cure a bad hangover.The atmosphere is great and the food is even better. However they service can be hit or miss. It was top notch a few years ago and then started to get a bit flakey which is one of the reason I don't go as often, but I'm happy to say that after my last visit all seems to be good again.If you're going for breakfast don't just go for The Full Monty, their pancakes are next level so make sure you get some. I personally love the All American. Bacon, sausage, potato and pancakes, sounds weird but it's great.

But seriously their breakfast was great and I really can't wait to come back again with friends. I gotta mention again that the staff was super cool. This is a company that's doing it right Side note: As a vegetarian I really wish the UK would adopt Morning Star products into their menu.	great food  chill staff  good vibes  i m super into this place which probably comes from being a ny transplant in the uk  but seriously their breakfast was great and i really can t wait to come back again with friends  i gotta mention again that the staff was super cool  this is a company that s doing it right side note  as a vegetarian i really wish the uk would adopt morning star products into their menu

(While we're on the subject - yes we're talking about the restaurant, but if you don't like the film, we seriously can't be friends.)They recently had a make over, which i'm still adjusting to (I'm a cancer and a bit resistant to change), but frankly it still totally does the job in getting delicious food into my mouth. The service can be a bit manic - but as long as there's a pint sized Bloody and a Ham so Eggsited in front of me in front of me in a reasonable amount of time, I'm happy as a clam.	i know some people have issues with the breakfast club  but i ve always had a lovely time   while we re on the subject   yes we re talking about the restaurant  but if you don t like the film  we seriously can t be friends  they recently had a make over  which i m still adjusting to  i m a cancer and a bit resistant to change   but frankly it still totally does the job in getting delicious food into my mouth  the service can be a bit manic   but as long as there s a pint sized bloody and a ham so eggsited in front of me in front of me in a reasonable amount of time  i m happy as a clam 
544	4.0	And so I find myself at the Breakfast Club, Shoreditch again. It's our default breakfast meeting place when we can't think of anything new. I guess that's because it's mostly reliably good. This morning I'm having the huevos rancheros, which are as good as I've had in London. My other regular choices are the avocado with poach eggs, bacon and chilli and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, which are also pretty consistent. I used to go for the full breakfast, but found it a little dull in comparison. My colleagues enjoy the bircher muesli, but I've never tried it.The service here can be a bit erratic, as they seem to value hiring staff based on how hipster they are instead of how good they are at waiting tables, but it's usually good enough.We normally come weekday early morning, and so never have to queue to get in, but I'd imagine this is a different story for weekend brunch, if the queue at the Islington branch is anything to go by.	and so i find myself at the breakfast club  shoreditch again  it s our default breakfast meeting place when we can t think of anything new  i guess that s because it s mostly reliably good  this morning i m having the huevos rancheros  which are as good as i ve had in london  my other regular choices are the avocado with poach eggs  bacon and chilli and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon  which are also pretty consistent  i used to go for the full breakfast  but found it a little dull in comparison  my colleagues enjoy the bircher muesli  but i ve never tried it the service here can be a bit erratic  as they seem to value hiring staff based on how hipster they are instead of how good they are at waiting tables  but it s usually good enough we normally come weekday early morning  and so never have to queue to get in  but i d imagine this is a different story for weekend brunch  if the queue at the islington branch is anything to go by 
545	5.0	If you have an appetite for breakfast, this place has no equal.Gigantic portions, the ability to customise dishes to your liking (within reason) and friendly staff make this place a pleasure when you can hardly open your eyes or see what you're ordering at 8am in the morning.A nice touch are changes to the menu for events like pancake day or christmas. Suddenly you get red pancakes with egg and bacon stacked high. And challenges that accompany that. Like finishing 20 pieces of pancake to get your meal free. Christmas is even better with Christmas Sandwiches and Full Dinners in the Breakfast club style, which is oft. More Bacon makes a Better Meal.Once you've discovered this place, it's the place you'll feel like you're cheating on whenever you go elsewhere.	if you have an appetite for breakfast  this place has no equal gigantic portions  the ability to customise dishes to your liking  within reason  and friendly staff make this place a pleasure when you can hardly open your eyes or see what you re ordering at 8am in the morning a nice touch are changes to the menu for events like pancake day or christmas  suddenly you get red pancakes with egg and bacon stacked high  and challenges that accompany that  like finishing 20 pieces of pancake to get your meal free  christmas is even better with christmas sandwiches and full dinners in the breakfast club style  which is oft  more bacon makes a better meal once you ve discovered this place  it s the place you ll feel like you re cheating on whenever you go elsewhere

I also had a detox juice (Apple, orange, ginger and carrot) that was very healthy and nice.

On a low-carb thing, I had to bypass the amazing looking Banana French Toast with Bacon and some awesome smoothie mixes.Instead, I went with the Eggs Royale, a split English Muffin (which I skipped) with two poached eggs on top of a solid portion of smoked salmon, which in turn was topped with a good portion of hollandaise (see picture). Great latte in a huge cup. Perfect!Really neat decorations in this place. First, there aren't any two tables that match. And the chairs are a weird combination of just about everything possible Completely randomized. Stuff on the wall is like that ""vintage"" decor you find in some American theme restaurants, but this stuff seems like it's real and not fake.Wi-fi is protected, but I found the password was ""gettingjiggywithit"".Note that the place gets very very busy as the morning progresses.

Sure, in America it would be average, but when you're craving real maple syrup, there are only so many places you can go. My favourite dishes are: -eggs on toast with 3 tomato jam-pancakes with berries (don't order if you don't like sweet, but I love this. It is basically a short stack of pancakes with a huge plop of vanilla whipped cream, berries, and maple syrup on the side. I actively crave this dish.The bacon is not QUITE exactly American bacon, but it is crispy and as close as I've found in London.Don't come on a weekend though (or come early), if it can be helped. Huge lines make it not worth it. Its good, but it isn't 'queue for a long time' good.	i really don t understand the 2 star reviews from other americans   granted  i ve only been to the hoxton location  but i ve always liked my food here  sure  in america it would be average  but when you re craving real maple syrup  there are only so many places you can go  my favourite dishes are   eggs on toast with 3 tomato jam pancakes with berries  don t order if you don t like sweet  but i love this  it is basically a short stack of pancakes with a huge plop of vanilla whipped cream  berries  and maple syrup on the side  i actively crave this dish the bacon is not quite exactly american bacon  but it is crispy and as close as i ve found in london don t come on a weekend though  or come early   if it can be helped  huge lines make it not worth it  its good  but it isn t  queue for a long time  good 
549	4.0	My partner and I actually went to check out the monster supply shop in Hoxton on a Sunday, found it was shut, wandered around and found The Breakfast Club and remembered a friend of ours recommended it.We had to wait outside for half an hour or so (queueing), but after walking past and smelling the amazing smell of BREAKFAST we were loath to leave and go elsewhere. It was lovely though as the staff kept coming out to apologise to the queue and provide little complimentary hot drinks of mint or ginger for us cold folk!Once inside, we were overwhelmed with breakfast choice. You can actually see into the kitchen and the chefs hard at work and I was amazed at the quality and quantity of food appearing - huge portions presented really well! Of course not in a fancy presentation but rather food piled high, looking delicious and crying out to be eaten!We went for a pitcher of orange juice between us (fresh orange juice, arrived a shiny metal pitcher with lots of ice) which worked out an amazing deal, I think we managed to have 3 or 4 glasses each from this - in fact we even had some left over which we gifted to the people sat next to us so they got some free orange juice and the staff even brought them over glasses with ice to enjoy the juice, no complaints from the staff!The food was as good as it looked, absolutely perfect. I have attached photographs as well so please do check them out! The staff were lovely and polite, people were not rushed out and there were even board games being played over breakfasts. Really want to go back here.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars is simply the wait to get seated, or in the cold time we visited, the wait to get INSIDE. I don't know how it'd be possible to fix this as it was pretty packed of seats but if you are in a rush this isn't the place for you. But do make time to come and enjoy breakfast here, whatever time of day!As a warning too, Wi-Fi is FREE but not in use at the weekend.	my partner and i actually went to check out the monster supply shop in hoxton on a sunday  found it was shut  wandered around and found the breakfast club and remembered a friend of ours recommended it we had to wait outside for half an hour or so  queueing   but after walking past and smelling the amazing smell of breakfast we were loath to leave and go elsewhere  it was lovely though as the staff kept coming out to apologise to the queue and provide little complimentary hot drinks of mint or ginger for us cold folk once inside  we were overwhelmed with breakfast choice  you can actually see into the kitchen and the chefs hard at work and i was amazed at the quality and quantity of food appearing   huge portions presented really well  of course not in a fancy presentation but rather food piled high  looking delicious and crying out to be eaten we went for a pitcher of orange juice between us  fresh orange juice  arrived a shiny metal pitcher with lots of ice  which worked out an amazing deal  i think we managed to have 3 or 4 glasses each from this   in fact we even had some left over which we gifted to the people sat next to us so they got some free orange juice and the staff even brought them over glasses with ice to enjoy the juice  no complaints from the staff the food was as good as it looked  absolutely perfect  i have attached photographs as well so please do check them out  the staff were lovely and polite  people were not rushed out and there were even board games being played over breakfasts  really want to go back here the reason for 4 out of 5 stars is simply the wait to get seated  or in the cold time we visited  the wait to get inside  i don t know how it d be possible to fix this as it was pretty packed of seats but if you are in a rush this isn t the place for you  but do make time to come and enjoy breakfast here  whatever time of day as a warning too  wi fi is free but not in use at the weekend

552	4.0	Very helpful lady at the door helped us get a nice table for 5 during a very busy lunch (on a Monday, so this place must be popular). We were very happy to be tucked away in the back/side room so we could talk although ironically they then put some music on really loud (turned it down on our request though). Warning about this side room - the most comfortable looking chair may turn out to be something you feel you will be trapped and tortured in forever. Go round to the far side.Drinks a bit slow both with ordering and subsequent arrival but the food came fairly swiftly and made everyone very happy. I tried both cow & pig burger and the beef chilli cheese (SPLITTING obviously, I am not a total pie) and overall preferred the latter although basically loved both. My friend got buffalo wings which are technically a starter but the portion is massive, and also delicious, so I finished them (oh wait, I am a total pie). I want to go back so I can try the burrito, and/or the mac & cheese options.NB this is not an everyday office lunch place - main with a drink will be over £10.	very helpful lady at the door helped us get a nice table for 5 during a very busy lunch  on a monday  so this place must be popular   we were very happy to be tucked away in the back side room so we could talk although ironically they then put some music on really loud  turned it down on our request though   warning about this side room   the most comfortable looking chair may turn out to be something you feel you will be trapped and tortured in forever  go round to the far side drinks a bit slow both with ordering and subsequent arrival but the food came fairly swiftly and made everyone very happy  i tried both cow   pig burger and the beef chilli cheese  splitting obviously  i am not a total pie  and overall preferred the latter although basically loved both  my friend got buffalo wings which are technically a starter but the portion is massive  and also delicious  so i finished them  oh wait  i am a total pie   i want to go back so i can try the burrito  and or the mac   cheese options nb this is not an everyday office lunch place   main with a drink will be over  10 
553	4.0	After a very satisfying visit at the Artillery Lane TBC two weeks ago, I decided to try the branch I've never been to. Judging by the speed and efficiency of the Spitalfield branch, I'd calculated that I should be able to have a lovely quick lunch and be back at the office within an hour. I couldn't be more wrong! Even though the place was only full slightly above half, we waited 45 minutes for our burgers. But it was worth waiting for! The smoked fish burger was melting in my mouth. It was full of flavours, moist and nicely complemented with coriander and mango.I liked the atmosphere and the décor too. And the fact that if has so many different sections. So you can a little bit industrial front, dinery corner on the right and another hidden corner at the back for more romantic dinners.I've seen lost of people ordering poached eggs with avocado and salmon.

I don't think there is any under the 3 stars.This place is a fake or it's just one of the greatest places in London.Aaaaaaaaaand... it's the latter one.First, the atmosphere: Not really the place for hard hungovers, as there is a lot of light, lot of noise, lot of music. And a queue of at least a quarter of hour in front of the door.But if you just spent a great night with somebody (ok well at a second thought..... if you spent a great night with a friend in visit or something like that, not really for your morning-after date!) then this is the place where to have a good robust breakfast the morning after.You have american breakfast, english breakfast, and a lot of other things, toasts, pancakes etc! And it's just good, really good!Probably my rate is biased by the fact that I'm not the most experienced person for judjying an american breakfast (damn I'm italian, my best breakfast will always be a cappuccino&brioche!), but I love this place, and every time a friend of mine is in town I bring them here!	105 reviews  i don t think there is any under the 3 stars this place is a fake or it s just one of the greatest places in london aaaaaaaaaand    it s the latter one first  the atmosphere  not really the place for hard hungovers  as there is a lot of light  lot of noise  lot of music  and a queue of at least a quarter of hour in front of the door but if you just spent a great night with somebody  ok well at a second thought      if you spent a great night with a friend in visit or something like that  not really for your morning after date   then this is the place where to have a good robust breakfast the morning after you have american breakfast  english breakfast  and a lot of other things  toasts  pancakes etc  and it s just good  really good probably my rate is biased by the fact that i m not the most experienced person for judjying an american breakfast  damn i m italian  my best breakfast will always be a cappuccino brioche    but i love this place  and every time a friend of mine is in town i bring them here

I was walking around on Easter Sunday starving like a whore in church. Everything in sight was closed, kept walking and out of the corner of my eye saw a sign that read ""Breakfast Club."" So I did what any lost Angeleno would do and cut right to the front of the line and told the girl with the perky fun bags I need to grub as bad as she needed dental work. I made my way to the back of the restaurant and noticed there was more talent here than my last family reunion.I sat down, ordered a bloody mary to get things going (they add chopped cucumbers which is cool) and then ordered the chorizo, eggs and potato dish. On freakin point! The food was not only hearty and good but it wasn't greasy as you would come to expect. The menu can be considered to be very Americanish probably because its loaded with pancake and omelet combos and other diner type items. They also have traditional English breakfast items but then again I'm no connoisseur.  Either way I highly recommend you give this place a try if your looking to have a great meal in a trendy environment."	one of the best breakfasts i ve ever had  this is what i consider diner food without the heartburn  this place was so good i went bofe days i was in london  that s right bofe  i was walking around on easter sunday starving like a whore in church  everything in sight was closed  kept walking and out of the corner of my eye saw a sign that read  breakfast club   so i did what any lost angeleno would do and cut right to the front of the line and told the girl with the perky fun bags i need to grub as bad as she needed dental work  i made my way to the back of the restaurant and noticed there was more talent here than my last family reunion i sat down  ordered a bloody mary to get things going  they add chopped cucumbers which is cool  and then ordered the chorizo  eggs and potato dish  on freakin point  the food was not only hearty and good but it wasn t greasy as you would come to expect  the menu can be considered to be very americanish probably because its loaded with pancake and omelet combos and other diner type items  they also have traditional english breakfast items but then again i m no connoisseur   either way i highly recommend you give this place a try if your looking to have a great meal in a trendy environment

And no one looked even remotely like Emilio Estevez or Molly Ringwald, which was a little surprising considering the large contingent of hipsters eating here. I quickly got over it though when I was told that I just HAD to go check out the bathroom (which I dutifully documented for you: yelp.com/biz_photos/ao-y…).Great decor aside, the food here is pretty decent but not exactly ""American style"" as some reviews claim - we don't have bacon this good in the United States. Being afraid of what I'd heard about black pudding, I opted for the Half Monty. It was so filling I can't imagine what the Full Monty would have done to me.

566	3.0	We were a party of 4 and came on a Saturday morning (at 11:30 AM) to avoid the rush hour. And it worked  (we had previously tried the Soho outlet, and given up after waiting for 1 hour).My general impression of the place is that it is a bit overrated: the food is really good, but a bit to pricey and the service sort of makes you feel as if you were brunching in a factory. We had two sets of american breakfasts, and Two blueberry pancakes. Both came in great quantity and every thing was tasty and filling to say the least.But clients keep coming in and out and waiters are a bit overwhelmed: we had to wait a lot and ask several times each time we had something to ask (be it water, or the check or the card machine) and they were not making any effort on being agreeable. I'm quite sure there are several places in London where you can taste equally tasty food, at a better price and with better service.	we were a party of 4 and came on a saturday morning  at 11 30 am  to avoid the rush hour  and it worked   we had previously tried the soho outlet  and given up after waiting for 1 hour  my general impression of the place is that it is a bit overrated  the food is really good  but a bit to pricey and the service sort of makes you feel as if you were brunching in a factory  we had two sets of american breakfasts  and two blueberry pancakes  both came in great quantity and every thing was tasty and filling to say the least but clients keep coming in and out and waiters are a bit overwhelmed  we had to wait a lot and ask several times each time we had something to ask  be it water  or the check or the card machine  and they were not making any effort on being agreeable  i m quite sure there are several places in london where you can taste equally tasty food  at a better price and with better service

The menu is split into breakfast/brunch (running till 5pm) the the dinner menu (which still contains some breakfast items) takes over. All the key dishes you'd expect from an American-ish diner are there. Your huge eggs, breakfast burritos and French toast have all been sampled and they're just great. The vast amount of sides available also allow you to really make the plate of food yours. (I mean, always throw on extra advacado!)...BUT, the pancakes are incredible. Huge stacks of fluffy and moist cakes with lashings of what ever makes you tick. We went for some fruit and the vanilla cream, which is somewhere between the cream between an Oreo, whipped double cream, oh and heaven. Seriously order what you need, then add pancakes!The setting is very cool, it feel like the antiques roadshow have had a huge blowout party but it all works. Smeg fridges, old pianos, number plates on the walls and mismatched chairs and tables. It works. The staff are more than helpful and really work hard to make your experience a good one. The only watch out??? The line! Morning in the weekend can stretch to an hour and even mid-week I've seen 20-30 mins. But there are other ones in Liverpool St and Angel, so can all be fixed with a short tube ride. You've got to go here and get involved, especially good with friends or family visiting from out of town!Now, more pancakes...	i ve been back and forth to this place for a while now and ghad dam  what food  breakfast is easily the most important meal of the day and by taking any cynic here  they ll soon get on board  the menu is split into breakfast brunch  running till 5pm  the the dinner menu  which still contains some breakfast items  takes over  all the key dishes you d expect from an american ish diner are there  your huge eggs  breakfast burritos and french toast have all been sampled and they re just great  the vast amount of sides available also allow you to really make the plate of food yours   i mean  always throw on extra advacado     but  the pancakes are incredible  huge stacks of fluffy and moist cakes with lashings of what ever makes you tick  we went for some fruit and the vanilla cream  which is somewhere between the cream between an oreo  whipped double cream  oh and heaven  seriously order what you need  then add pancakes the setting is very cool  it feel like the antiques roadshow have had a huge blowout party but it all works  smeg fridges  old pianos  number plates on the walls and mismatched chairs and tables  it works  the staff are more than helpful and really work hard to make your experience a good one  the only watch out    the line  morning in the weekend can stretch to an hour and even mid week i ve seen 20 30 mins  but there are other ones in liverpool st and angel  so can all be fixed with a short tube ride  you ve got to go here and get involved  especially good with friends or family visiting from out of town now  more pancakes

My boyfriend took me as a surprise as this particular one in Hoxton used to have sofas and boardgames - they no longer had.We went in the evening and it was quite empty. The waitress came and asked for our orders about 2 minutes after we'd sat down, we ordered drinks and she then took forever to take our order again for food.Eventually the food and cocktails we ordered came together. It all looked and tasted great, until my boyfriend kept finding egg shell in his eggs, then thick hairs in both of our cocktails (underneath the ice, not even floating on top).We told the nearest waiter to us whom didn't seem bothered. He took the drinks away and came back rolling his eyes saying ""what do you want to do?""  - I suspect he thought we were trying to get out of paying though it hadn't been mentionedEventually we said we were just going to leave the rest of the food and go. He said he was the manager and started to be really rude and as we walked out the door he told us not to come back!! Who would go back to a place with that level of customer service?! I don't recommend this location for ANY breakfast club fan."	unhygienic and an awful service   this was my first time hearing of the breakfast club  my boyfriend took me as a surprise as this particular one in hoxton used to have sofas and boardgames   they no longer had we went in the evening and it was quite empty  the waitress came and asked for our orders about 2 minutes after we d sat down  we ordered drinks and she then took forever to take our order again for food eventually the food and cocktails we ordered came together  it all looked and tasted great  until my boyfriend kept finding egg shell in his eggs  then thick hairs in both of our cocktails  underneath the ice  not even floating on top  we told the nearest waiter to us whom didn t seem bothered  he took the drinks away and came back rolling his eyes saying  what do you want to do      i suspect he thought we were trying to get out of paying though it hadn t been mentionedeventually we said we were just going to leave the rest of the food and go  he said he was the manager and started to be really rude and as we walked out the door he told us not to come back   who would go back to a place with that level of customer service   i don t recommend this location for any breakfast club fan

I went for the cheese burger which was delish. The cocktails are a fiver during a happy hour. I ordered a dark'n'stormy (my favourite drink of all time) with little expectation. By golly was it good. May have been the best dark'n'stormy I have ever laid my lips on.Scrumptious.	this won t be a shocker if you ve read the other reviews cosy yet light and welcoming  this breakfast club is such a lovely place to catch up with your nearest and dearest  i went for the cheese burger which was delish  the cocktails are a fiver during a happy hour  i ordered a dark n stormy  my favourite drink of all time  with little expectation  by golly was it good  may have been the best dark n stormy i have ever laid my lips on scrumptious 
574	5.0	They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day -- and The Breakfast Club is the perfect excuse to eat it all day long.The fairly extensive menu has a homemade-by-an-American-mum kind of freshness and flavor. Options range from sweet (fresh fruit, cinnamon and sugar) to savory (bacon, veggies, cheese, and eggs). And if you plan on eating your breakfast for dinner, there are a few alcoholic drink options to choose from. The interior has a Shoreditch feel to it: vintage decor hanging from the walls and ceiling, plus a mix of patterns, fabrics, and seating types. I've never had trouble finding a seat, even with a small group.The combination of creative decor and delicious, hearty food makes The Breakfast Club a winner.	they say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day    and the breakfast club is the perfect excuse to eat it all day long the fairly extensive menu has a homemade by an american mum kind of freshness and flavor  options range from sweet  fresh fruit  cinnamon and sugar  to savory  bacon  veggies  cheese  and eggs   and if you plan on eating your breakfast for dinner  there are a few alcoholic drink options to choose from  the interior has a shoreditch feel to it  vintage decor hanging from the walls and ceiling  plus a mix of patterns  fabrics  and seating types  i ve never had trouble finding a seat  even with a small group the combination of creative decor and delicious  hearty food makes the breakfast club a winner 
575	4.0	Every time I'm around Hoxton Square, most of the restaurants are too crowded and have 45 minute wait times. And what true Londoner has a full three-quarts of their precious hour to spend waiting around for a seat in a diner?Yet, I've never failed to find a seat in The Breakfast Club at Shoreditch/Hoxton. Unlike it's sister venue at Liverpool Street (which usually has a waiting line going down the street), I've never seen this restaurant quite so packed out. The restaurant staff are friendly, and will generally go out of their way to make sure you have a good dining experience.On our visit, we arrived shortly before 5pm (when their day menu changes to their evening menu), and we were given the wrong menu. After having to compensate for a couple of things in our late, late breakfast (who doesn't want Mexican refried beans in lieu of baked beans?), our waitress was very apologetic. In the end, she struck off the jug of fruit smoothie from our bill - Result!The full English breakfast is about as good as a breakfast usually is, without all the ingredients being ridiculously sourced from exotic animals. All the trimmings were on the plate, and a lovely evening breakfast was had.Also, the Americans-style pancakes are definitely recommended. Ask for extra maple syrup.. because there's no such thing as too much maple syrup.

578	2.0	"I'm really just so confused by The Breakfast Club.  Are we London expats just so excited by the prospect of an American-ish breakfast that we're all turning a blind eye to the fact that the food is actually pretty crummy here?I got the All-American, excited by the appearance of what looked to be a ""real"" American pancake on a neighbor's plate.  I will say this for the positives: my eggs were really well poached, the sausage was tasty, and there was a rather generous portion of streaky bacon on my plate.  That being said, the streaky bacon was somehow not very flavorful... so I ended up dragging a lot of it through some HP sauce.  And the potatoes were bland and desperately lacking in crispiness of any sort.  But the criminal offender on my plate were those pancakes.  They looked so promising.  They were dense.  Soooooo dense.  Look, I'm a horrific cook.  I have no shame in admitting that.  But there are a couple things I do well and fluffy, light pancakes are one of them.  Guess what... they're not hard to make if a crappy cook such as myself can do it.  I basically had a giant pancakey brick in my stomach for the majority of the day.There were other food faux-pas, but Grant pretty much said it all.  The worst (aside from the pancakes) for me was the inconsumable Bloody Mary, which I just left unfinished.I will say that service was nice.  Super nice.  But frankly, the most enjoyable thing about the meal was sitting at the table, brainstorming variations of ""Don't You Forget About Me"" for the beginning of Grant's review."	i m really just so confused by the breakfast club   are we london expats just so excited by the prospect of an american ish breakfast that we re all turning a blind eye to the fact that the food is actually pretty crummy here i got the all american  excited by the appearance of what looked to be a  real  american pancake on a neighbor s plate   i will say this for the positives  my eggs were really well poached  the sausage was tasty  and there was a rather generous portion of streaky bacon on my plate   that being said  the streaky bacon was somehow not very flavorful    so i ended up dragging a lot of it through some hp sauce   and the potatoes were bland and desperately lacking in crispiness of any sort   but the criminal offender on my plate were those pancakes   they looked so promising   they were dense   soooooo dense   look  i m a horrific cook   i have no shame in admitting that   but there are a couple things i do well and fluffy  light pancakes are one of them   guess what    they re not hard to make if a crappy cook such as myself can do it   i basically had a giant pancakey brick in my stomach for the majority of the day there were other food faux pas  but grant pretty much said it all   the worst  aside from the pancakes  for me was the inconsumable bloody mary  which i just left unfinished i will say that service was nice   super nice   but frankly  the most enjoyable thing about the meal was sitting at the table  brainstorming variations of  don t you forget about me  for the beginning of grant s review

Menu is extensive, you could literally eat a different (and I'm sure delicious) meal every day for weeks. Had the Veggie All American - was not disappointed. Caramel latte was perfect. The little bit of pickle juice in the Bloody Mary was perfect. :-)Definitely try this place once for brunch.	brunch all day long  bring your appetite and your friends  great atmosphere  fun  kitschy  menu is extensive  you could literally eat a different  and i m sure delicious  meal every day for weeks  had the veggie all american   was not disappointed  caramel latte was perfect  the little bit of pickle juice in the bloody mary was perfect     definitely try this place once for brunch 
580	2.0	"""Don't queue... Forget about me.""This should be the theme song for this restaurant with the same name as the quintessential John Hughes movies from the 80's. When I arrived, I thought I would be having an experience similar to Allison: kooky, sexy and fun. What I received was more like Brian: plain, boring and trying way too hard to fit in.There was a queue when we arrived and it only took us about a half an hour to get in, so it wasn't bad, but I did overhear someone mention that she didn't understand why there was a queue because there was plenty of seating inside. (Maybe that's why it went so fast.)When we got in and seated, we were at the center shared table. I'm down with that sort of dining. The decor was very eclectic in that wanna-be hipster sort of way. Trying way too hard to look like they're not trying at all.We started with Bloody Marys and ordered four meals (there were three of us, but ever since I was introduced to ""table waffle"" by some friends, I'm always doing it at brunch now): The Full Monty (a full English), The All-American, Huevos ala Benny and Banana and Bacon French Toast. The Bloody Marys were absolutely terrible. We drank them quickly so we could move on to Prosecco and orange juice. The Full Monty: Your standard English breakfast. Except almost everything was sub-standard. The black pudding was dry and thick and not at all delicious. Of the two poached eggs, one was slightly overcooked and the other was completely overcooked. The bacon was hard and chewy and not at all good. The toast had no butter so was dry and gross. The mushrooms and potatoes were alright, nothing special. The only good thing on the plate was the sausage (which they probably don't make themselves).The All-American: Dry, overcooked and rubbery pancakes. I'm not a chef, I'm probably your better-than-average home cook. I definitely make better pancakes. What a disappointment. I saw a sign for Pancake Tuesday saying eat 12 in 20 minutes. I wouldn't want to eat one of their pancakes in 20 minutes let alone 12 of them. At least the poached eggs on this plate were cooked right. The Huevos: This was the only good plate of food. Everything was actually quite tasty. One of the poached eggs was slightly overcooked, but the other was perfect. I felt bad because this was my meal, and I was probably the only one of the three of us who enjoyed it.The French Toast: If by now you're still thinking about coming here (which I highly recommend NOT doing), do not order the french toast. It was by far the worst french toast I've eaten. The bread was BARELY dragged through the egg wash which left the inside rock hard and chewy. Very tough and no flavor. To soften it up, I poured on twice as much maple syrup. It made it edible. It made me sad. I made french toast at home and it was insanely better than what they try to pass off as french toast here. The bananas were just chopped up and thrown on top (it would have been nice for a bit of caramelization to bring out some of the banana flavor, but no they were just cold chopped up bananas.) The bacon was all right, and there was lots of it. A note on the home fried potatoes. I liked them. Neither of my dining partners did. They both complained that they needed more flavor and needed to be crispier.I was surprised at how quickly the meal came out. The kitchen really cranks out the food. However, I think I would rather have them make GOOD food instead of FAST food. When I go out, I expect to be eating food that I either can't make at home. If I can make it at home, I expect a restaurant to do a better job. I could pretty much whip up any of these dishes at home (and far better). Probably because I actually would be putting the time in to try to make it good instead of whatever the chefs here think they're doing.The straw that broke the camel's back was the orange juice we got to make Mimosas (that's Buck's Fizz to you Brits) out of the Prosecco. When it arrived, it was full of ice. Really? No one wants ice in their juice. Especially if you're using it to add to bubbly alcohol. I'm already diluting it, I don't want to have ice floating around in my bubbly. It's just plain wrong.At least the service was reasonable. Friendly faces abound.Which is pretty much my opinion of The Breakfast Club. Plain wrong. Good in concept but very poor in execution. By the time we were ready to leave, there was still a queue outside. And a slightly empty looking restaurant. It seems that they keep a queue outside for the hype instead of letting people sit down. And they need the hype because the food is pretty terrible. But we all know that Brits love to queue and the sheer act of queuing seems to make things better. Not for me, and I will not be coming back."	 don t queue    forget about me  this should be the theme song for this restaurant with the same name as the quintessential john hughes movies from the 80 s  when i arrived  i thought i would be having an experience similar to allison  kooky  sexy and fun  what i received was more like brian  plain  boring and trying way too hard to fit in there was a queue when we arrived and it only took us about a half an hour to get in  so it wasn t bad  but i did overhear someone mention that she didn t understand why there was a queue because there was plenty of seating inside   maybe that s why it went so fast  when we got in and seated  we were at the center shared table  i m down with that sort of dining  the decor was very eclectic in that wanna be hipster sort of way  trying way too hard to look like they re not trying at all we started with bloody marys and ordered four meals  there were three of us  but ever since i was introduced to  table waffle  by some friends  i m always doing it at brunch now   the full monty  a full english   the all american  huevos ala benny and banana and bacon french toast  the bloody marys were absolutely terrible  we drank them quickly so we could move on to prosecco and orange juice  the full monty  your standard english breakfast  except almost everything was sub standard  the black pudding was dry and thick and not at all delicious  of the two poached eggs  one was slightly overcooked and the other was completely overcooked  the bacon was hard and chewy and not at all good  the toast had no butter so was dry and gross  the mushrooms and potatoes were alright  nothing special  the only good thing on the plate was the sausage  which they probably don t make themselves  the all american  dry  overcooked and rubbery pancakes  i m not a chef  i m probably your better than average home cook  i definitely make better pancakes  what a disappointment  i saw a sign for pancake tuesday saying eat 12 in 20 minutes  i wouldn t want to eat one of their pancakes in 20 minutes let alone 12 of them  at least the poached eggs on this plate were cooked right  the huevos  this was the only good plate of food  everything was actually quite tasty  one of the poached eggs was slightly overcooked  but the other was perfect  i felt bad because this was my meal  and i was probably the only one of the three of us who enjoyed it the french toast  if by now you re still thinking about coming here  which i highly recommend not doing   do not order the french toast  it was by far the worst french toast i ve eaten  the bread was barely dragged through the egg wash which left the inside rock hard and chewy  very tough and no flavor  to soften it up  i poured on twice as much maple syrup  it made it edible  it made me sad  i made french toast at home and it was insanely better than what they try to pass off as french toast here  the bananas were just chopped up and thrown on top  it would have been nice for a bit of caramelization to bring out some of the banana flavor  but no they were just cold chopped up bananas   the bacon was all right  and there was lots of it  a note on the home fried potatoes  i liked them  neither of my dining partners did  they both complained that they needed more flavor and needed to be crispier i was surprised at how quickly the meal came out  the kitchen really cranks out the food  however  i think i would rather have them make good food instead of fast food  when i go out  i expect to be eating food that i either can t make at home  if i can make it at home  i expect a restaurant to do a better job  i could pretty much whip up any of these dishes at home  and far better   probably because i actually would be putting the time in to try to make it good instead of whatever the chefs here think they re doing the straw that broke the camel s back was the orange juice we got to make mimosas  that s buck s fizz to you brits  out of the prosecco  when it arrived  it was full of ice  really  no one wants ice in their juice  especially if you re using it to add to bubbly alcohol  i m already diluting it  i don t want to have ice floating around in my bubbly  it s just plain wrong at least the service was reasonable  friendly faces abound which is pretty much my opinion of the breakfast club  plain wrong  good in concept but very poor in execution  by the time we were ready to leave  there was still a queue outside  and a slightly empty looking restaurant  it seems that they keep a queue outside for the hype instead of letting people sit down  and they need the hype because the food is pretty terrible  but we all know that brits love to queue and the sheer act of queuing seems to make things better  not for me  and i will not be coming back

He warned me there could be a long wait but it that it would be totally worth it.As we got there we noticed the queue was going half way down the street, with a lot of cold and hungry looking hipster-type people waiting. My friend assured me that it would be worth the wait - and to be honest if people are prepared to wait half an hour or more for some food then it can only be a good sign, right?Well after a half hour wait, we finally got inside and were shown to hour seats by a lovely member of staff - she was bubbly and enthusiastic and made me feel most welcome. What can I say about the menu! My god - AMAZING!! Absolutely every type of breakfast you can think of, American-Style pancakes, waffles, English Breakfasts, Breakfast Burritos and a whole lot more. They also have a really good vegetarian menu so the veggies won't miss out!I opted for a full English, My friend had the breakfast burrito. At just under ten pounds it was a lot cheaper than I expected it to be, especially with it being in super-pricey Hoxton!I loved everything about the place, it was very busy but the staff were really cool and helpful, and the decor was great too.My only wish is that they open a Breakfast club in Brighton - they would make an absolute killing!!	if you want an amazing breakfast  in a place with a great vibe then the breakfast club is the place to go i was persuaded to go there on my most recent visit to london  by a friend that lives nearby  he warned me there could be a long wait but it that it would be totally worth it as we got there we noticed the queue was going half way down the street  with a lot of cold and hungry looking hipster type people waiting  my friend assured me that it would be worth the wait   and to be honest if people are prepared to wait half an hour or more for some food then it can only be a good sign  right well after a half hour wait  we finally got inside and were shown to hour seats by a lovely member of staff   she was bubbly and enthusiastic and made me feel most welcome  what can i say about the menu  my god   amazing   absolutely every type of breakfast you can think of  american style pancakes  waffles  english breakfasts  breakfast burritos and a whole lot more  they also have a really good vegetarian menu so the veggies won t miss out i opted for a full english  my friend had the breakfast burrito  at just under ten pounds it was a lot cheaper than i expected it to be  especially with it being in super pricey hoxton i loved everything about the place  it was very busy but the staff were really cool and helpful  and the decor was great too my only wish is that they open a breakfast club in brighton   they would make an absolute killing  
584	1.0	Got here shortly after opening and really wanted to love this place. Interior is cute, good music and to its credit the coffee is very good. However the service was poor- slow to take my order, get food, and pay. Didn't check up once during the meal- was drinking my water bottle as I couldn't get a water refill. If the food was amazing I'd be able to overlook poor service... But the bacon egg and cheese was very sad. Toasted English muffin was soggy, eggs overdone so that yolks were hard and eggs rubbery, cheese clumped and not spread over the sandwich. Overall lacking flavor. One of the worst BEC I have had. Hate to post a bad review but look elsewhere if a BEC is what you're after.	got here shortly after opening and really wanted to love this place  interior is cute  good music and to its credit the coffee is very good  however the service was poor  slow to take my order  get food  and pay  didn t check up once during the meal  was drinking my water bottle as i couldn t get a water refill  if the food was amazing i d be able to overlook poor service    but the bacon egg and cheese was very sad  toasted english muffin was soggy  eggs overdone so that yolks were hard and eggs rubbery  cheese clumped and not spread over the sandwich  overall lacking flavor  one of the worst bec i have had  hate to post a bad review but look elsewhere if a bec is what you re after

589	5.0	"I have to say that the breakfasts here are really very good. They don't take reservations in the morning though, so sometimes you'll have to wait outside in the cold but once you get a table, you can enjoy trendy music and some of the best service I've had in the city. The menu has everything from eggs, to beans, to bacon (if you want American bacon, i.e. crispy thin bacon, you must ask for ""streaky bacon""). They also have black pudding, vegetarian sausage and a variety of smoothies plus sweet breakfasts like pancakes. The Breakfast Club is a good option for vegetarians because they have a lot of vegetarian meals indicated as such. Not so sure for vegans because most things will have eggs or some kind of milk. This restaurant is in the heart of the trendy SOHO disrict of London but don't let that fool you. The service is just as friendly as if they were in a smaller location and really needed your business (at other places like this , that areoften packed, so you could think they might not care about an individual client but really, not the case here.) The waiter was attentive, always checking that we had enough juice, coffee, if we needed anything, if the meal was ok. Everything. The food is great. I had the eggs with streaky bacon and veggie sausage. The veggie sausage is made from tomatoes and mozza so takes some getting used to.The one thing I'd say is that you should probably order tea here as the coffee was a little disappointing compared to the greatness of the overall meal. Not terrible, just a little bitter and less flavorful than I usually like. But drinkable.

To eat, I had the all American breakfast which came with a HUGE side of bacon (in America you literally get two little strips of bacon with breakfast). I recommend getting a side of fruit with your breakfast, it's a yummy mixture of different fruits. I want to try the eggs benedict next time!

I had never been to this location, but was won over, even after the 30 minute wait.Yes, arriving at 1pm, we waited about half an hour for our group of 5 to be seated.  Considering there was a menu posted outside, we were ready with our orders right away.  I dove in with a strawberry shake, huevos rancheros, and split a pancakes and berries with a friend.  Huevos ranchers were delicious -- the only thing spicy was a sauce that was one side, but the rest of the place was superb -- tortilla with melted cheese in the middle, 2 fried eggs, sour cream, guacamole, beans and 2 sausages. YUM. And for something sweet -- pancakes with berries -- four panckaes served with just the right about of syrup and berries and a MOUNTAIN of cream.  Needless to say, I was not very hungry by dinner time.  I was still dreaming about my brunch at the Breakfast Club.Not raving about the shake, as it wasn't anything special.  I honestly might try a smoothie the next time.All in all, a definite keeper.	loved loved loved this place  i had never been to this location  but was won over  even after the 30 minute wait yes  arriving at 1pm  we waited about half an hour for our group of 5 to be seated   considering there was a menu posted outside  we were ready with our orders right away   i dove in with a strawberry shake  huevos rancheros  and split a pancakes and berries with a friend   huevos ranchers were delicious    the only thing spicy was a sauce that was one side  but the rest of the place was superb    tortilla with melted cheese in the middle  2 fried eggs  sour cream  guacamole  beans and 2 sausages  yum  and for something sweet    pancakes with berries    four panckaes served with just the right about of syrup and berries and a mountain of cream   needless to say  i was not very hungry by dinner time   i was still dreaming about my brunch at the breakfast club not raving about the shake  as it wasn t anything special   i honestly might try a smoothie the next time all in all  a definite keeper

601	1.0	The kind of place where the staff show up to see their mates and the customers are an inconvenience. Obviously, in our waitresses case, she was far too cool to be working there and didn't so much walk as she did drag herself around the place. When asked questions about the food and how it was prepared, she would guess. And guess incorrectly. I wouldn't mind the queue, but this is London, not New York or Berlin, so the food inside was of course obvious and uninspired and completely unworthy of waiting outside. Bacon this. Fried egg that. It would be good to go somewhere so obviously cool like this and see a bit of ingenuity, but, in typical London fashion, only the bare minimum and the least amount of effort is provided. Not worth the money as the food would have been exactly the same in my local greasy spoon. My veggie breakfast was bland, the veggie sausages were dry and almost flavourless. It says you get mushrooms. You get one mushroom, withered and sad with no seasoning. A tiny pot of beans. If you happen to be vegan, you are screwed. Utterly boring and tedious. Really nice interior design though! And comfy chairs.	the kind of place where the staff show up to see their mates and the customers are an inconvenience  obviously  in our waitresses case  she was far too cool to be working there and didn t so much walk as she did drag herself around the place  when asked questions about the food and how it was prepared  she would guess  and guess incorrectly  i wouldn t mind the queue  but this is london  not new york or berlin  so the food inside was of course obvious and uninspired and completely unworthy of waiting outside  bacon this  fried egg that  it would be good to go somewhere so obviously cool like this and see a bit of ingenuity  but  in typical london fashion  only the bare minimum and the least amount of effort is provided  not worth the money as the food would have been exactly the same in my local greasy spoon  my veggie breakfast was bland  the veggie sausages were dry and almost flavourless  it says you get mushrooms  you get one mushroom  withered and sad with no seasoning  a tiny pot of beans  if you happen to be vegan  you are screwed  utterly boring and tedious  really nice interior design though  and comfy chairs

We waited the line for about 15 minutes before a table came up and are super happy that we didn't give up and go elsewhere.  We had our New Year's day brunch her (at, ahem, 3pm) & it was absolutely perfect. A casual, comfortable spot but the food was what really hit it out of the park. I chose eggs benedict while my partner enjoyed huevos rancheros (and we split sides of fruit and home fries). Everything was fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented. The coffee is quite amazing as well!If you can't tell - I highly recommend!	hmmm    how to start  five stars  yes  loved the decor  the menu  the staff  the crowd  all wonderful  we waited the line for about 15 minutes before a table came up and are super happy that we didn t give up and go elsewhere   we had our new year s day brunch her  at  ahem  3pm    it was absolutely perfect  a casual  comfortable spot but the food was what really hit it out of the park  i chose eggs benedict while my partner enjoyed huevos rancheros  and we split sides of fruit and home fries   everything was fresh  tasty  and beautifully presented  the coffee is quite amazing as well if you can t tell   i highly recommend

Avocado is fantastic except when served in a heaping mess as the main event.Yes, it's pricey and just a once-in-awhile sort of thing.

614	4.0	Having been a place I've wanted to try for God knows how long, but either a too long queue or just plans not going ahead, it is only recently I have experienced The Breakfast Club. I've decided to review my fave location out of the three I've been to. The portions at each location seem to vary. I am basing this on the portions for the pancakes and berries. This place and the Artillery Lane serve 4, where as the Soho branch serves 3. So the pancakes. I have to say they are my favourite pancakes in London. For something so simple they got it right.  I usually just use the buttermilk pancake mix from Costco to make my American style pancakes, but I will gladly part money when the pancakes are this good. The only complaint is that they don't use Aunt Jemima's syrup (which is my FAVE and only syrup I like to use at home), but I know that is an absurd request, therefore an invalid complaint, I am just picky. I also (because I eat way too much) ordered the Huevos Ranchero. The chorizo sausages they use are hella tasty as well as the beans served with it. Usually Mexican food in the UK is a huge let down for me. But this hit the mark of being exceptional. I then became obsessed with making my own variations at home. I've been the The Breakfast Club 3 times in 3 weeks. Had pancakes each time. It's the place I know think of when I think where to go for a bite to eat.	having been a place i ve wanted to try for god knows how long  but either a too long queue or just plans not going ahead  it is only recently i have experienced the breakfast club  i ve decided to review my fave location out of the three i ve been to  the portions at each location seem to vary  i am basing this on the portions for the pancakes and berries  this place and the artillery lane serve 4  where as the soho branch serves 3  so the pancakes  i have to say they are my favourite pancakes in london  for something so simple they got it right   i usually just use the buttermilk pancake mix from costco to make my american style pancakes  but i will gladly part money when the pancakes are this good  the only complaint is that they don t use aunt jemima s syrup  which is my fave and only syrup i like to use at home   but i know that is an absurd request  therefore an invalid complaint  i am just picky  i also  because i eat way too much  ordered the huevos ranchero  the chorizo sausages they use are hella tasty as well as the beans served with it  usually mexican food in the uk is a huge let down for me  but this hit the mark of being exceptional  i then became obsessed with making my own variations at home  i ve been the the breakfast club 3 times in 3 weeks  had pancakes each time  it s the place i know think of when i think where to go for a bite to eat 
615	5.0	This just-South-of-Hoxton Square branch of the popular Soho breakfast spot/sandwich joint/free WiFi paradise opened last Wednesday and it's about to be my new favorite place in London.  That is, as soon as they get the free WiFi installed next week. Unlike the Soho outpost, which is adorable but smaller than than my ex-boyfriends...closet, this Breakfast Club is spacious, sunny, and oh so happily decorated. There are comfy leather couches, worn benches, picnic tables, kitschy wall decorations, enamel buckets full of condiments, surfboards, colorful lettering, and assorted antique-y chairs of all kinds. Most importantly,  the bathrooms fill me with an overflowing abundance of joy that bubbles out of my pores and stretches a smile across my face. You walk into the 'Bathrooms and World's Smallest Disco' to a revolving disco ball and four different stalls independently wallpapered with memories of my childhood. He-Man and Masters of the Universe. Ghostbusters. Fraggle Rock. Strawberry Shortcake. This place makes me feel like a five-year-old-dancing with adorable little monsters to the Fraggle Rock theme song. Besides the toilets, the food is AWESOME (that's a bad switch in topics in one sentence). An excellent flat white, creamy and strong and perfect for an unnecessarily early morning. A delicious bacon bap/butty/bit of perfection is a soft white roll generously swabbed with butter and stuffed full of salty savory stupendous streaky bacon. My companion's BLT was another bite of blissfulness.

So the food is great but what makes the breakfast club stand out for me is the attentiveness of the staff. As soon as you are out of juice or coffee, they come. Also, if you want to customize your meal (this instead of that, more sausage and no bacon, etc) they are more than happy to accommodate even the most pickey pallet! Deco is simple, like London's version of the diner. A must if you are in the neighborhood.

So I don't know whether I had my expectations set too high, but I was seriously not impressed. For £10, I had bland scrambled eggs with no texture whatsoever; a really disgusting vegetarian sausage (apparently the pork sausage, which I don't eat, was just as bad); dodgy looking and tasting mushrooms; and decent beans. I really do wish I went to the little cafe around the corner and had a nice little fry up for about £4. Also, if you want to go to The Breakfast Club, do NOT go on a Sunday morning. You will find yourself waiting for at least half an hour if not more. However, I have to be completely honest here- I should have gone for the pancakes. I had serious table/menu envy (not too sure what it's called) when i saw the 4 big pancakes being delivered to the next table. In that respect, I am actually going to go back to The Breakfast Club to try them out and let you know what I think!	i moved to the shoreditch area about a month or so ago  and there had been a lot of hype over  the breakfast club   seriously  a lot of hype  so i don t know whether i had my expectations set too high  but i was seriously not impressed  for  10  i had bland scrambled eggs with no texture whatsoever  a really disgusting vegetarian sausage  apparently the pork sausage  which i don t eat  was just as bad   dodgy looking and tasting mushrooms  and decent beans  i really do wish i went to the little cafe around the corner and had a nice little fry up for about  4  also  if you want to go to the breakfast club  do not go on a sunday morning  you will find yourself waiting for at least half an hour if not more  however  i have to be completely honest here  i should have gone for the pancakes  i had serious table menu envy  not too sure what it s called  when i saw the 4 big pancakes being delivered to the next table  in that respect  i am actually going to go back to the breakfast club to try them out and let you know what i think

I was pretty disappointed with what I got!There was a short queue on a Sunday morning, staff were friendly and it moved pretty quickly so can't complain about that.We ordered a variety of breakfasts, one having pancakes, another veggie burrito and I went for sausage and egg sandwich. I love chorizo so the idea of a chorizo in a butty excited me, but it wasn't great quality and even the egg was pretty over cooked! The veggie burrito was pretty tasteless. Pancakes were good, but from what I've heard they are meant to be the best pancakes in london and they are definitely not!One very positive thing to say is that the staff are super helpful."	i ve just moved to hoxton  and one of the first places on my list of  to do s  was breakfast club  i was pretty disappointed with what i got there was a short queue on a sunday morning  staff were friendly and it moved pretty quickly so can t complain about that we ordered a variety of breakfasts  one having pancakes  another veggie burrito and i went for sausage and egg sandwich  i love chorizo so the idea of a chorizo in a butty excited me  but it wasn t great quality and even the egg was pretty over cooked  the veggie burrito was pretty tasteless  pancakes were good  but from what i ve heard they are meant to be the best pancakes in london and they are definitely not one very positive thing to say is that the staff are super helpful 
621	4.0	I came twice while on holiday in London (and staying in Hoxton).  Once for a late nite snack and once for breakfast.  Food and service were excellent both times.  But I thought L14 was pricey for breakfast.  The apple juice was L4! (it's fresh pressed).  The late nite snack was pancakes and berries, which I enjoyed.  Would go back, but only to snack.	i came twice while on holiday in london  and staying in hoxton    once for a late nite snack and once for breakfast   food and service were excellent both times   but i thought l14 was pricey for breakfast   the apple juice was l4   it s fresh pressed    the late nite snack was pancakes and berries  which i enjoyed   would go back  but only to snack 
622	3.0	I continue to return to The Breakfast Club because it's location is convenient, the breakfast burrito rocks my world, and the atmosphere makes me happy. The service is borders on obnoxiously slow, which only really bothers me when I'm ready to pay and leave. I always have a good time when I go and they have a nice happy hour, so that increases the fun. It seems to be my friends' choices too when we're wondering where to go for any meal of the day or just a coffee and a chat. Seems like we all pretty much enjoy it.	i continue to return to the breakfast club because it s location is convenient  the breakfast burrito rocks my world  and the atmosphere makes me happy  the service is borders on obnoxiously slow  which only really bothers me when i m ready to pay and leave  i always have a good time when i go and they have a nice happy hour  so that increases the fun  it seems to be my friends  choices too when we re wondering where to go for any meal of the day or just a coffee and a chat  seems like we all pretty much enjoy it 
623	4.0	A little slice of home. Or at least it reminded me of a place in Brooklyn I brunched at before. Cute decor, lots of seating, bright open space. Came on a bank holiday, pre-brunch hours, so there was no waiting which was nice.  I ordered something healthy with a side of bacon. Of course. The healthy was poached eggs atop mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and parmesan shavings. yum. Alas, the bacon was not real american style bacon. IT DIDNT CLAIM TO BE. But my food order was based entirely on what they served the guy next to me and the bacon looked like the genuine article from 3 feet away. The only con so far is that they seated us on this weird long picnic bench with another couple next to us and the guy kept shifting around which made for an interesting carnival style ride while waiting for my food. Not fun once I was trying to enjoy eating said food though.	a little slice of home  or at least it reminded me of a place in brooklyn i brunched at before  cute decor  lots of seating  bright open space  came on a bank holiday  pre brunch hours  so there was no waiting which was nice   i ordered something healthy with a side of bacon  of course  the healthy was poached eggs atop mushrooms  cherry tomatoes and parmesan shavings  yum  alas  the bacon was not real american style bacon  it didnt claim to be  but my food order was based entirely on what they served the guy next to me and the bacon looked like the genuine article from 3 feet away  the only con so far is that they seated us on this weird long picnic bench with another couple next to us and the guy kept shifting around which made for an interesting carnival style ride while waiting for my food  not fun once i was trying to enjoy eating said food though 
624	5.0	I am not sure how anyone would give The Breakfast Club less than 5 stars. I studied abroad in London for 6 months and I lived around the corner from this magical place. It has the BEST breakfast food I have ever had. I am pretty sure I went to it at least 10+ times. I brought family and friends and everyone loved it. Their eggs benedict and French toast with bananas and bacon are to die for. Not only does the food come out beautifully but the decor inside is amazing. Every chair is different, the decorations have a diner feel but an urban look. I absolutely love The Breakfast Club and if you are in London and do not go to it, that is a shame.	i am not sure how anyone would give the breakfast club less than 5 stars  i studied abroad in london for 6 months and i lived around the corner from this magical place  it has the best breakfast food i have ever had  i am pretty sure i went to it at least 10  times  i brought family and friends and everyone loved it  their eggs benedict and french toast with bananas and bacon are to die for  not only does the food come out beautifully but the decor inside is amazing  every chair is different  the decorations have a diner feel but an urban look  i absolutely love the breakfast club and if you are in london and do not go to it  that is a shame

As with most things I've eaten in London so far, this isn't the BEST, but it is pretty tasty. Their menu offers a really good selection, especially their smoothie choices! I really enjoyed my Bacon and Banana french toast, though i was a little disappointed when it came out and the strips of bacon were sitting on top of the french toast and not inside of it, as I had thought. (I know what some of you may be thinking - bacon INSIDE french toast?? Trust me - it exists and it's gooohd.) Huevos Rancheros - whatevs. I'll be returning to this place soon to try all the other goodies :)	any restaurant that plays 90s r b and hip hop  the good shit  is already good in my book  i love the decor and ambiance of this restaurant   eclectic  charming  relaxed  as with most things i ve eaten in london so far  this isn t the best  but it is pretty tasty  their menu offers a really good selection  especially their smoothie choices  i really enjoyed my bacon and banana french toast  though i was a little disappointed when it came out and the strips of bacon were sitting on top of the french toast and not inside of it  as i had thought   i know what some of you may be thinking   bacon inside french toast   trust me   it exists and it s gooohd   huevos rancheros   whatevs  i ll be returning to this place soon to try all the other goodies

627	5.0	Love this place for many reasons.  First, the food is solid.  Excellent apple cinnamon French toast, real salads, and some other dietary staples for me.  Second, the people here are nice and actually happy to help you...which is a pleasant change from most of Shoreditch.  Third, the space is great.  Lots of diverse seating.  Giant front windows that open in the summer.  Miniature arcade machine in the back.  Classic cartoon wallpaper in the bathrooms.  All in all just a great place.	love this place for many reasons   first  the food is solid   excellent apple cinnamon french toast  real salads  and some other dietary staples for me   second  the people here are nice and actually happy to help you   which is a pleasant change from most of shoreditch   third  the space is great   lots of diverse seating   giant front windows that open in the summer   miniature arcade machine in the back   classic cartoon wallpaper in the bathrooms   all in all just a great place 
628	2.0	Ate at this spot after having a great experience at the one in Angel.  Thought that this one in Hoxton would be easy to get into in the morning as it is in the epicenter of hipster living and therefore would have a less motivated breakfast crowd.  I was right about the queue, no wait at opening.  Food was good, especially if you are looking for American-style breakfast with a cool vibe.  Pancakes are good and the Huevos Rancheros were surprisingly really good with excellent chorizo and a good use of a quesedilla (not too much cheese) instead of just a tortilla (makes for a good base to stack your salsa, beans, quac on).  Service was absolutely horrendous though.  With the restaurant half full it took us 20 minutes to get our coffee, it actually came after the food arrived.  Food was a little cold and we soon saw plenty of dishes stacking up in the kitchen window.  Plenty of staff around but they seemed more concerned about talking with each other than doing any work.  Wife and I both waited tables for many years so we may have more awareness than normal on seeing causes of bad service (not multitasking, talking with coworkers) but the effects were obvious with everyone else also looking for food, bills, someone to seat them.  They definitely need to have a manager in the mornings to make sure these servers actually do some work.  Will definitely go back to BC when I want a good breakfast but will avoid this particular one.	ate at this spot after having a great experience at the one in angel   thought that this one in hoxton would be easy to get into in the morning as it is in the epicenter of hipster living and therefore would have a less motivated breakfast crowd   i was right about the queue  no wait at opening   food was good  especially if you are looking for american style breakfast with a cool vibe   pancakes are good and the huevos rancheros were surprisingly really good with excellent chorizo and a good use of a quesedilla  not too much cheese  instead of just a tortilla  makes for a good base to stack your salsa  beans  quac on    service was absolutely horrendous though   with the restaurant half full it took us 20 minutes to get our coffee  it actually came after the food arrived   food was a little cold and we soon saw plenty of dishes stacking up in the kitchen window   plenty of staff around but they seemed more concerned about talking with each other than doing any work   wife and i both waited tables for many years so we may have more awareness than normal on seeing causes of bad service  not multitasking  talking with coworkers  but the effects were obvious with everyone else also looking for food  bills  someone to seat them   they definitely need to have a manager in the mornings to make sure these servers actually do some work   will definitely go back to bc when i want a good breakfast but will avoid this particular one

Or maybe just meant to be silly! There is usually a great mix of people here all throughly enjoying their food which makes the experience complete! My friends like the banana and bacon french toast but its a mountain of food and I tend to go more savory anyhow so I like to pick something like the mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and poached egg on toast or the huevos rancheros!

631	4.0	Better than the Soho location: more spacious, better lighting, and better ambiance in generally. Food is the same: pancakes and french toast were a little boring (pancakes were bland, french toast could've used a bit more seasoning), but the eggs, smoothies, and coffee are good. The kitchen is fast but the wait staff could be more attentive. Being as busy as they are, however, I'm willing to give them a little leniency. There's usually a wait on the weekend, so either get there early or bring a book (or, better yet, an interesting friend). Prices are reasonable and portions are good, but not obscenely large.Overal, a good place to go for brunch if you don't mind the wait.	better than the soho location  more spacious  better lighting  and better ambiance in generally  food is the same  pancakes and french toast were a little boring  pancakes were bland  french toast could ve used a bit more seasoning   but the eggs  smoothies  and coffee are good  the kitchen is fast but the wait staff could be more attentive  being as busy as they are  however  i m willing to give them a little leniency  there s usually a wait on the weekend  so either get there early or bring a book  or  better yet  an interesting friend   prices are reasonable and portions are good  but not obscenely large overal  a good place to go for brunch if you don t mind the wait

Fraggle Rock? More like Fraggle Rock 'n roll...    ...see what I did there? (Nice one Laura. Real nice.) Turns out, the goodness doesn't just stop at the potty, but extends to the food as well, which is much less awkward when it's not typed in the same sentence, I promise. Like the other BC branches, the food is a pleasant blend of Brit meets Americana, with ample options from both sides of the pond.

634	4.0	Last night we were walking around Hoxton and we spotted it, and after seeing that huevos rancheros were on the menu, we decided we had to go the next morning. We got there at noon and there was a fairly substantial queue, but that didn't dissuade us as I always figure, if there's a line, then they're doing something right. We wait maybe a half hour and get in, the the decor was very homey and lived in. For someone who is used to eating in more grand places, this probably wouldn't be for you. I found the decor really charming and fun. Once inside we really didn't have to wait long to order or for our food to arrive, it seemed we had just ordered 5 minutes before and they were already out. I got the huevos rancheros without the chorizo (as I'm vegetarian although I bet the refried beans were fried in animal fat, oh well), and that was quite nice. The portion was pretty much perfect for me, and I guess you could say I have an average-above average appetite. The refried beans were much better than most I've had before, and the guacamole was also quite good. It was a proper messy dish, which is exactly how I like my Hispanic food :D I'd 100% go there again, next time with a bigger crowd, as it has such a friendly atmosphere and its the sort of place I just want to share with everyone else.	last night we were walking around hoxton and we spotted it  and after seeing that huevos rancheros were on the menu  we decided we had to go the next morning  we got there at noon and there was a fairly substantial queue  but that didn t dissuade us as i always figure  if there s a line  then they re doing something right  we wait maybe a half hour and get in  the the decor was very homey and lived in  for someone who is used to eating in more grand places  this probably wouldn t be for you  i found the decor really charming and fun  once inside we really didn t have to wait long to order or for our food to arrive  it seemed we had just ordered 5 minutes before and they were already out  i got the huevos rancheros without the chorizo  as i m vegetarian although i bet the refried beans were fried in animal fat  oh well   and that was quite nice  the portion was pretty much perfect for me  and i guess you could say i have an average above average appetite  the refried beans were much better than most i ve had before  and the guacamole was also quite good  it was a proper messy dish  which is exactly how i like my hispanic food  d i d 100  go there again  next time with a bigger crowd  as it has such a friendly atmosphere and its the sort of place i just want to share with everyone else

And that is 30 minutes for a small breakfast in a normal not so busy day. They finally started moving faster when I said they either bring the food or I leave. Anyhow. The food itself wasn't bad. But there's plenty other places in the area with nicer food and better custome service.	very bad service  i m not impressed at all  i came here with a friend  the place wasn t too busy yet we were made to wait quite a while to be seated  then again the food took 30 minutes  and that is 30 minutes for a small breakfast in a normal not so busy day  they finally started moving faster when i said they either bring the food or i leave  anyhow  the food itself wasn t bad  but there s plenty other places in the area with nicer food and better custome service

Yes, please, Sam, I am! Goes perfectly with their delicious bloody marys.

639	2.0	Hmm.. okSo I had a really cool memory of the breakfast club, from when Chris O. and Mei L. had dinner there, and we came and joined them after the Yelp GoGame (wasn't that an awesome 4th of July game!! - YeeHaw!!)So, I'd already experienced the ubercool toilets disco, and tasted a few morsels of falafel and hummus.  So we decided to come and check this place out for our staff lunch this Friday.It was one 'bad' experience.  From the staff being extremely busy on a Friday lunchtime, to just really terrible food, it wasn't pleasant.  I'd ordered the wrap with spinach and halloumi cheese, and I'm sorry to say, it tasted terrible.  The cheese was all clumped into one end of the wrap, whilst the falafel, spinach and roasted tomatoes were loosely on the other half, and eating it, either you got a mouthful of just two or three layers of cheese and wrap, or you would have to bite off the spinach, hummus and sundried tomatoes part..  The salad that accompanied it was poorly dressed (though I doubt it was dressed at all), and whilst it's great to have uber healthy sprouts on the salad, the lack of seasoning totally spoiled it.The coleslaw was more watery than mayonnaisy, and the wrap appeared to be half soaked or drenched in it's own juices, I'm guessing.Can't say I was terribly impressed with the green smoothie I ordered either, it was ok, but honestly, I've had way better.The waitress that served us seemed to be permanently trying to keep busy, but wasn't taking any time to take care of us, the customers.  It seems it was more important for her to clear tables off of empty tables, as the lunch hour was finishing, than to take our money and let us leave.  We ended up making our way to the door, to pay by the entrance, and only then did she seem to take an interest in us.. probably hoping we might tip her for ignoring us, and giving us some terrible food.The only saving grace, at this meal, was the nachos starters.  With melted cheese, we took the veggie option with refried beans, and it had sour cream, and guacamole, and with that starter we were all just in heaven!! It was amazing and yummi, and next time if I ever dare go there again, I'll be relying on that dish alone to make sure I have something remotely edible and yummy.I'm sure they have better dishes, and their service isn't always 'that' terrible.. but whatever you do, don't order that halloumi panini.. it's like chalk and cheese when you eat it, literally.. :(	hmm   okso i had a really cool memory of the breakfast club  from when chris o  and mei l  had dinner there  and we came and joined them after the yelp gogame  wasn t that an awesome 4th of july game     yeehaw   so  i d already experienced the ubercool toilets disco  and tasted a few morsels of falafel and hummus   so we decided to come and check this place out for our staff lunch this friday it was one  bad  experience   from the staff being extremely busy on a friday lunchtime  to just really terrible food  it wasn t pleasant   i d ordered the wrap with spinach and halloumi cheese  and i m sorry to say  it tasted terrible   the cheese was all clumped into one end of the wrap  whilst the falafel  spinach and roasted tomatoes were loosely on the other half  and eating it  either you got a mouthful of just two or three layers of cheese and wrap  or you would have to bite off the spinach  hummus and sundried tomatoes part    the salad that accompanied it was poorly dressed  though i doubt it was dressed at all   and whilst it s great to have uber healthy sprouts on the salad  the lack of seasoning totally spoiled it the coleslaw was more watery than mayonnaisy  and the wrap appeared to be half soaked or drenched in it s own juices  i m guessing can t say i was terribly impressed with the green smoothie i ordered either  it was ok  but honestly  i ve had way better the waitress that served us seemed to be permanently trying to keep busy  but wasn t taking any time to take care of us  the customers   it seems it was more important for her to clear tables off of empty tables  as the lunch hour was finishing  than to take our money and let us leave   we ended up making our way to the door  to pay by the entrance  and only then did she seem to take an interest in us   probably hoping we might tip her for ignoring us  and giving us some terrible food the only saving grace  at this meal  was the nachos starters   with melted cheese  we took the veggie option with refried beans  and it had sour cream  and guacamole  and with that starter we were all just in heaven   it was amazing and yummi  and next time if i ever dare go there again  i ll be relying on that dish alone to make sure i have something remotely edible and yummy i m sure they have better dishes  and their service isn t always  that  terrible   but whatever you do  don t order that halloumi panini   it s like chalk and cheese when you eat it  literally

The menu is gratuitously comfort food, a good bit of the seating is generously spacious and the prices (though far from budget) won't set you back too much. I love the burgers. Chilli's good also. Service is generally receptive and without any Hoxton Square attitude (and they don't seem to mind if you linger over your laptop in the afternoon).

Yes the food is lovely, yes the smoothies make me dibble in the glass (never try mine if I offer!) but in this area there are possibly not better breakfast places but definitely better eateries!It will soon be getting wifi and it's a nice lace for meetings but sorry Breakfast Club Hoxton, I love your mamma shop more.Okay I have just realised this and I didn't include the toilet love - I've just added a star!	if the food in london wasn t so damn good this place would get more stars  the fact this is the second branch i have visited also has affected my judgment  yes the food is lovely  yes the smoothies make me dibble in the glass  never try mine if i offer   but in this area there are possibly not better breakfast places but definitely better eateries it will soon be getting wifi and it s a nice lace for meetings but sorry breakfast club hoxton  i love your mamma shop more okay i have just realised this and i didn t include the toilet love   i ve just added a star 
645	4.0	Best breakfast I've had in London, and right up there with one of the best Eggs Benedict I've had ever (which is a bold statement, since I consider SF to be the motherland of brunches and benedicts.)While the All-American breakfast seems to be the obvious choice - skip it, and go with the Eggs Florentine (Benedict with spinach instead of ham.) Or the smoked salmon version which was tasty too and ingredients were super fresh. Great coffee and juices concoctions too, and not super expensive. I could find an excuse to go every Sunday, I think. Also remember to get your bacon streaky (is there really any other way??)Atmosphere is funky and cool, of course aided by the tiny bathroom disco, which was a little strange, but hilarious. The only downside is the service is pretty slow and slightly inattentive, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. Also, to avoid waiting an hour to eat you should come before 10:30, especially on Sundays.	best breakfast i ve had in london  and right up there with one of the best eggs benedict i ve had ever  which is a bold statement  since i consider sf to be the motherland of brunches and benedicts  while the all american breakfast seems to be the obvious choice   skip it  and go with the eggs florentine  benedict with spinach instead of ham   or the smoked salmon version which was tasty too and ingredients were super fresh  great coffee and juices concoctions too  and not super expensive  i could find an excuse to go every sunday  i think  also remember to get your bacon streaky  is there really any other way   atmosphere is funky and cool  of course aided by the tiny bathroom disco  which was a little strange  but hilarious  the only downside is the service is pretty slow and slightly inattentive  but don t let that stop you from checking it out  also  to avoid waiting an hour to eat you should come before 10 30  especially on sundays 
646	4.0	Rarely have I ordered an English breakfast I couldn't finish.  In fact stuff rarely, once, at the Breakfast Club.  This wasn't because it wasn't good, it was just because it was massive, overflowing, all encompassing and ridiculous. Putting aside the world food shortages (which probably coincide with the expansion of this mini chain) the food is good but large.  This was an English breakfast with a proper sausage, quality bacon, luxuriant black pudding, and all the rest.  Much better than equivalents I regularly have at the Wolseley, Roast etc..The decor is a bit like a new version of TGI Fridays but then TGI Fridays was once cool wasn't it?	rarely have i ordered an english breakfast i couldn t finish   in fact stuff rarely  once  at the breakfast club   this wasn t because it wasn t good  it was just because it was massive  overflowing  all encompassing and ridiculous  putting aside the world food shortages  which probably coincide with the expansion of this mini chain  the food is good but large   this was an english breakfast with a proper sausage  quality bacon  luxuriant black pudding  and all the rest   much better than equivalents i regularly have at the wolseley  roast etc  the decor is a bit like a new version of tgi fridays but then tgi fridays was once cool wasn t it

648	5.0	I loved this place! It has a real retro feel to it and seems to be separated into 'rooms' - dining room, kitchen and lounge! They have really thought through the decor in here and made it a lovely atmosphere. They also played some brilliant retro tunes as well! We opted for the cocktails of rhappy hour (£4 - usually £6) and between us had nachos, fried hallumi, burritos and wedges. Yum! Really good food! One of the highlights has to be the toilets! They are all decked out with retro wall paper - one if covered floor to celiging in ghost-busters wallpaper! And there is a disco ball in the waiting area to keep you occupied in a queue! It'd be a really good place for a first date!	i loved this place  it has a real retro feel to it and seems to be separated into  rooms    dining room  kitchen and lounge  they have really thought through the decor in here and made it a lovely atmosphere  they also played some brilliant retro tunes as well  we opted for the cocktails of rhappy hour   4   usually  6  and between us had nachos  fried hallumi  burritos and wedges  yum  really good food  one of the highlights has to be the toilets  they are all decked out with retro wall paper   one if covered floor to celiging in ghost busters wallpaper  and there is a disco ball in the waiting area to keep you occupied in a queue  it d be a really good place for a first date 
649	1.0	The problems with The Breakfast Club, start with its name. Neither is it anything breakfast related, not anything to do with the awesome 80s movie of the same name. It is in fact an Aussie diner. Who would have guessed? After all that, as if that wasn't enough it is downhill from there. With £9 burritos and a less than inspired menu. if you are looking for a proper breakfast then head to The Diner around the corner, or any of the other venues in Shoreditch offering up the best kind of English Breakfast. If for lunch or anything else there are plenty of equally good options in Hoxton Sq and beyond. I went to TBC on more than one occasion both here and in Soho, but won't be rushing back any time soon.	the problems with the breakfast club  start with its name  neither is it anything breakfast related  not anything to do with the awesome 80s movie of the same name  it is in fact an aussie diner  who would have guessed  after all that  as if that wasn t enough it is downhill from there  with  9 burritos and a less than inspired menu  if you are looking for a proper breakfast then head to the diner around the corner  or any of the other venues in shoreditch offering up the best kind of english breakfast  if for lunch or anything else there are plenty of equally good options in hoxton sq and beyond  i went to tbc on more than one occasion both here and in soho  but won t be rushing back any time soon 
650	2.0	A friend told us that we must eat here when we visited London and were staying in the Hoxton/Shoreditch area.  We were disappointed.  I loved the 80s motif--I mean who doesn't love Strawberry Shortcake and Fragglerock wallpaper?  But I felt like it was more gimmick and less foodie.  I had the American breakfast and the pancakes were some of the worst pancakes I've ever had; they were heavy and cake, instead of light, fluffy, and thin.  The veggie sausage was quite weird and I can't say good.  The potatoes were meh.  The scrambled eggs were the best part.  Also, the latte was excellent.  The husband had a burger that was supposed to be just meat and cheese.  It came with meat, cheese, and a giant glob of mustard--gross!  If you love the 80s nostalgia, it's a fun place to at least experience.  If you're expecting great food, you may be disappointed, but maybe we just picked the wrong dishes.	a friend told us that we must eat here when we visited london and were staying in the hoxton shoreditch area   we were disappointed   i loved the 80s motif  i mean who doesn t love strawberry shortcake and fragglerock wallpaper   but i felt like it was more gimmick and less foodie   i had the american breakfast and the pancakes were some of the worst pancakes i ve ever had  they were heavy and cake  instead of light  fluffy  and thin   the veggie sausage was quite weird and i can t say good   the potatoes were meh   the scrambled eggs were the best part   also  the latte was excellent   the husband had a burger that was supposed to be just meat and cheese   it came with meat  cheese  and a giant glob of mustard  gross   if you love the 80s nostalgia  it s a fun place to at least experience   if you re expecting great food  you may be disappointed  but maybe we just picked the wrong dishes 
651	3.0	Excellent eggs benedict probably one of the best I've had. Arrive early though, not around lunch time as I did last Sunday. I was greeted with a queue leading out of the door in the rain. Annoyingly the people inside looked more preoccupied with talking as opposed to eating. Whether this was down to slow service I can only speculate. I did see a couple on a table that could have seated 4. I would have happily shared if I could have stated my case. Being at the back of the queue and with it raining my girlfriend and I abandoned our quest and went home to a local place I know.	excellent eggs benedict probably one of the best i ve had  arrive early though  not around lunch time as i did last sunday  i was greeted with a queue leading out of the door in the rain  annoyingly the people inside looked more preoccupied with talking as opposed to eating  whether this was down to slow service i can only speculate  i did see a couple on a table that could have seated 4  i would have happily shared if i could have stated my case  being at the back of the queue and with it raining my girlfriend and i abandoned our quest and went home to a local place i know 
652	3.0	I have to say, I love what the interior decorator did with the place. In it's old incarnation (pre-BC) it was a dark and rather meh location. Now every time I walk past, looking in through the big open windows, I really do want to walk right in and sit down. I love the loos as well. So props to them for making the place look welcoming.They do rather standard food, nothing that I find exciting on the menu. Tea, toast, coffee, and the jerk chicken all get good marks. Portions are very large (but I don't actually think that's a good thing, or at least it doesn't contribute to stars). Prices are ok. There are caffs where you could get a decent breakfast for half the price nearby, but those caffs don't have such a lovely interior and they shut at 3pm.This is definitely a place that makes me want to hang out a while, and since it's never totally packed, that's easy to do.	i have to say  i love what the interior decorator did with the place  in it s old incarnation  pre bc  it was a dark and rather meh location  now every time i walk past  looking in through the big open windows  i really do want to walk right in and sit down  i love the loos as well  so props to them for making the place look welcoming they do rather standard food  nothing that i find exciting on the menu  tea  toast  coffee  and the jerk chicken all get good marks  portions are very large  but i don t actually think that s a good thing  or at least it doesn t contribute to stars   prices are ok  there are caffs where you could get a decent breakfast for half the price nearby  but those caffs don t have such a lovely interior and they shut at 3pm this is definitely a place that makes me want to hang out a while  and since it s never totally packed  that s easy to do

655	4.0	I loved this place!The Breakfast Club in Shoredich has a distinctive style, typical of the East London scene. Decorated with various vintage objects and furnished with a range of tables, sofas and chairs of different size and colour, this place offers a wide choice of delicious dishes. You can go for delicious burritos and other food of the Mexican tradition or opt tasty burgers accompanied by old-style roasted potatoes. The place is also recommended for Sunday brunches (large range of delicious options) or just for enjoying its healthy creative juices, such spinach and yogurt mojito.	i loved this place the breakfast club in shoredich has a distinctive style  typical of the east london scene  decorated with various vintage objects and furnished with a range of tables  sofas and chairs of different size and colour  this place offers a wide choice of delicious dishes  you can go for delicious burritos and other food of the mexican tradition or opt tasty burgers accompanied by old style roasted potatoes  the place is also recommended for sunday brunches  large range of delicious options  or just for enjoying its healthy creative juices  such spinach and yogurt mojito 
656	4.0	A place you must go to once but probably a bit too expensive to become a regular breakfasting spot. The selection of breakfast choices is exciting, different and not your usual cornflakes and toast. I opted for the very American pancakes, bacon and maple syrup combination.....I probably wouldn't choose this again as after eating half I felt quite sick. The staff were very friendly however service was quite slow and I spent ages waiting for them to bring me the bill.

I would recommend this place to everyone - from people burned out from the night before and in need of refuelling to fresh-faced creative types looking for a cool breakfast meeting location to impress the clients. I had The Half Monty which was basically half a fry-up (I was too sober for a Full Monty) and it was absolutely delicious. Good sized portions, plenty of people watching to be done and decent prices.	shoreditch s reinvention of the typical greasy spoon caf   i would recommend this place to everyone   from people burned out from the night before and in need of refuelling to fresh faced creative types looking for a cool breakfast meeting location to impress the clients  i had the half monty which was basically half a fry up  i was too sober for a full monty  and it was absolutely delicious  good sized portions  plenty of people watching to be done and decent prices

They lost our drinks orders and by the time we managed to flag down a passing waiter to reorder we had finished all our food and it seemd a bit pointless. I had pancakes with fruit and some kind of weird cream that didn't melt even when it came into contact with warm pancakes. Do not go here if you are in a rush.

664	4.0	I quite liked this place early in the morning, right before I had a flight to catch. The space is open and bright, friendly and relaxed. The music was a bit too 80's and a bit too loud for B that early in the morning. Their toast, a big, very thick slice was tasty. You won't need much else for breakfast afterwards. My tea was just fine, B's coffee was deemed quite good. They offer more substantial breakfasts, plus salads and burgers for lunch/dinner. There's also a takeaway bar, particularly good for your morning coffee. They do the whole range of espresso drinks. Very friendly vibe, usually busy in the evenings. When they open the windows, it's especially nice. There's a cute room in the back that can be reserved for groups as well. Oh, and the loos are quite fun.	i quite liked this place early in the morning  right before i had a flight to catch  the space is open and bright  friendly and relaxed  the music was a bit too 80 s and a bit too loud for b that early in the morning  their toast  a big  very thick slice was tasty  you won t need much else for breakfast afterwards  my tea was just fine  b s coffee was deemed quite good  they offer more substantial breakfasts  plus salads and burgers for lunch dinner  there s also a takeaway bar  particularly good for your morning coffee  they do the whole range of espresso drinks  very friendly vibe  usually busy in the evenings  when they open the windows  it s especially nice  there s a cute room in the back that can be reserved for groups as well  oh  and the loos are quite fun 
665	4.0	I loved this place! The decor is an interesting mix of California beach style and New York coffee house. I loved the mismatch chairs and  80's music. I wanted to love this place before I'd even eaten anything.  Thank goodness the food is also stellar. I had the american breakfast, the big breakfast smoothie, and a cup of coffee. I was knocked out of the park by how good the smoothie was, it was totally worth the money and was my favorite thing I've eaten since I've got to London. The breakfast was pretty good, the meat portions especially. Get something with sausage when you go, they make a fantastic piece of sausage. The pancakes were good too. The only exception to the goodness was the eggs. I had them scrambled, and they tasted powdered. the meal was on the pricey side, and I feel for what I paid, they shouldn't be powdered or taste like it. The coffee also has the distinction of being the only kind I've ever liked black. (I didn't order it black, but the waiter just dropped it off and never came back, and as they were super busy and I didn't mind)In short, you should go. You should have a smoothie and enjoy the atmosphere. You may have a bit of a wait, we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated, but the staff is friendly and you won't want to leave.So it's worth it.	i loved this place  the decor is an interesting mix of california beach style and new york coffee house  i loved the mismatch chairs and  80 s music  i wanted to love this place before i d even eaten anything   thank goodness the food is also stellar  i had the american breakfast  the big breakfast smoothie  and a cup of coffee  i was knocked out of the park by how good the smoothie was  it was totally worth the money and was my favorite thing i ve eaten since i ve got to london  the breakfast was pretty good  the meat portions especially  get something with sausage when you go  they make a fantastic piece of sausage  the pancakes were good too  the only exception to the goodness was the eggs  i had them scrambled  and they tasted powdered  the meal was on the pricey side  and i feel for what i paid  they shouldn t be powdered or taste like it  the coffee also has the distinction of being the only kind i ve ever liked black   i didn t order it black  but the waiter just dropped it off and never came back  and as they were super busy and i didn t mind in short  you should go  you should have a smoothie and enjoy the atmosphere  you may have a bit of a wait  we had to wait 10 minutes before being seated  but the staff is friendly and you won t want to leave so it s worth it

671	3.0	I like Five Guys. They do good burgers and the drinks machine is mega cool. So I feel annoyed with myself for having to knock a star off for this particular trip.Here's why: I've been enough times now to know what to expect. I finally broke and got a hotdog this time (I'd tried it before but never had one to myself) and sadly it wasn't properly hot.From the looks of things it had only been cooked on one side which was not how is seen them done before - and oddly it was cooked much faster than I'd previously seen. Usually it takes longer than the burgers to cook, but strangely this time it was much faster.So that killed a point, along with the floor which is always slippery here! It feels like your walking on ice sometimes. But anyway, I think they had an off day, and I'd normally give them a four.	i like five guys  they do good burgers and the drinks machine is mega cool  so i feel annoyed with myself for having to knock a star off for this particular trip here s why  i ve been enough times now to know what to expect  i finally broke and got a hotdog this time  i d tried it before but never had one to myself  and sadly it wasn t properly hot from the looks of things it had only been cooked on one side which was not how is seen them done before   and oddly it was cooked much faster than i d previously seen  usually it takes longer than the burgers to cook  but strangely this time it was much faster so that killed a point  along with the floor which is always slippery here  it feels like your walking on ice sometimes  but anyway  i think they had an off day  and i d normally give them a four 
672	1.0	I'm really astonished that five guys has got such great reviews - there is simply nothing that I like about it:The price: I'd assumed the draw was the price, that even if it's sub-quality it's a cheap and fast eat... However with a basic hamburger at £6.75, and a cheeseburger is £8 (just to note this is on par with Meat Liquor, and the Ari Gold burger at Patty and Bun, which is drool worthy and award winning, is £7.50), and a regular fries being £4 (also to note fries are £3 at Meat Liquor, and £2.75 at Patty and Bun), I can't believe that it is! I was simply shocked by the cost! The food quality: The burger was overcooked, and made of cheap quality meat. Soggy bun, and whilst you can choose from a range of toppings for FREE, these are greasy, fatty with the salad feeling limp. The fries were soggy, low quality and too salty... A waste of time and both need to be slathered in sauce, which made me feel unwell. Although sauce is free here... eat all you want!The choice: Wow, free peanuts - really? Is that what it's takes to be different? I see very little on the menu here to make this place special or to stand out apart from these. A choice of free toppings might be an appeal - but I prefer my burger constructed, not just a random mesh of ingrediants slopped together.The restaurant: Full, busy, dirty. You have to queue up for a while to get your burgers and when you finally find a table, it's usually dirty / messy because with the sheer numbers that come though this joint, they can't keep up with the clear up. The place also just feels cheap!Why bother going here when you could go to a nice burger place - and if you want a cheap one - well why don't you go for a cheaper option at a nice burger place!Five times, really, really, really, really, really, not impressed.	i m really astonished that five guys has got such great reviews   there is simply nothing that i like about it the price  i d assumed the draw was the price  that even if it s sub quality it s a cheap and fast eat    however with a basic hamburger at  6 75  and a cheeseburger is  8  just to note this is on par with meat liquor  and the ari gold burger at patty and bun  which is drool worthy and award winning  is  7 50   and a regular fries being  4  also to note fries are  3 at meat liquor  and  2 75 at patty and bun   i can t believe that it is  i was simply shocked by the cost  the food quality  the burger was overcooked  and made of cheap quality meat  soggy bun  and whilst you can choose from a range of toppings for free  these are greasy  fatty with the salad feeling limp  the fries were soggy  low quality and too salty    a waste of time and both need to be slathered in sauce  which made me feel unwell  although sauce is free here    eat all you want the choice  wow  free peanuts   really  is that what it s takes to be different  i see very little on the menu here to make this place special or to stand out apart from these  a choice of free toppings might be an appeal   but i prefer my burger constructed  not just a random mesh of ingrediants slopped together the restaurant  full  busy  dirty  you have to queue up for a while to get your burgers and when you finally find a table  it s usually dirty   messy because with the sheer numbers that come though this joint  they can t keep up with the clear up  the place also just feels cheap why bother going here when you could go to a nice burger place   and if you want a cheap one   well why don t you go for a cheaper option at a nice burger place five times  really  really  really  really  really  not impressed

It was fun visiting a Five Guys in London. It's not my favorite burger in the states, and it wasn't my favorite burger in London. But it's solid. I was en route to dinner at Dishoom and I didn't want to ruin my appetite, so I opted for the small size burger (sans bun). Got it across the board with toppings and was in-and-out in about 8 minutes. It was a perfectly fine snack and tasted like all of my previous trips to Five Guys. Continuity when crossing a body of water is tough, but they did it perfectly.	some might call me out for visiting a five guys while vacationing on another continent  but when i see an american comfort food entity in a foreign country  i get very intrigued  it was fun visiting a five guys in london  it s not my favorite burger in the states  and it wasn t my favorite burger in london  but it s solid  i was en route to dinner at dishoom and i didn t want to ruin my appetite  so i opted for the small size burger  sans bun   got it across the board with toppings and was in and out in about 8 minutes  it was a perfectly fine snack and tasted like all of my previous trips to five guys  continuity when crossing a body of water is tough  but they did it perfectly

Only this I will say is that you should try the branch near Oxford Circus first as it isn't as busy as this one.	when i m craving a burger i always come to this place  great burger and free refills is always good  only this i will say is that you should try the branch near oxford circus first as it isn t as busy as this one

Quick service, burger was on the scale somewhere between Byron and Patty and Bun.	nice burger  nice chips  far too many chips though  great location close to seven dials covent garden etc  the milkshake  that was so tasty  had the salted caramel shake  amazing  quick service  burger was on the scale somewhere between byron and patty and bun

678	5.0	Got to love a concept where you customise your own burger and the chefs bring the vision to life with precision. The fries are crisp, perfectly salted and plentiful (more than what I would expect from a medium size), and the brand of ketchup is just right (Heinz).	got to love a concept where you customise your own burger and the chefs bring the vision to life with precision  the fries are crisp  perfectly salted and plentiful  more than what i would expect from a medium size   and the brand of ketchup is just right  heinz  
679	4.0	First Shake Shack, and now Five Guys.  London is great in opening our doors to our American ally.  They bring some of they best stuff across the pond and I think London should do it more often.  Unlike traditional fast food burgers which rely on cheap frozen supplies from its headquarters, Five Guys only serves freshly cooked meat.  There is no freezer on the premises which ensures they only serves fresh meat and ingredients.  I have tried Shake Shack and Five Guys in London and I have to say that burgers in Five Guys do perform slightly better than Shake Shack.  Although I do not see much difference in the meat quality as both of them are equally as fresh, I think that the meat in Five Guys are seasoned slightly better compared to Shake Shack.  The best thing about Five Guys is that you are able to custom mix your own topping for the burger which gives it an extra advantage compared to Shake Shack.  The bun itself is lightly buttered and toasted like Shake Shack but I believe that Shake Shack's bun is lighter and softer.  Unsure why I am comparing the both but I suppose I have to compare their pros and cons as they do have the same concept.  Fresh, simple, affordable quick burger.  Didn't try the milkshake or fries so will definitely be coming back to taste them next.  Great stuff.	first shake shack  and now five guys   london is great in opening our doors to our american ally   they bring some of they best stuff across the pond and i think london should do it more often   unlike traditional fast food burgers which rely on cheap frozen supplies from its headquarters  five guys only serves freshly cooked meat   there is no freezer on the premises which ensures they only serves fresh meat and ingredients   i have tried shake shack and five guys in london and i have to say that burgers in five guys do perform slightly better than shake shack   although i do not see much difference in the meat quality as both of them are equally as fresh  i think that the meat in five guys are seasoned slightly better compared to shake shack   the best thing about five guys is that you are able to custom mix your own topping for the burger which gives it an extra advantage compared to shake shack   the bun itself is lightly buttered and toasted like shake shack but i believe that shake shack s bun is lighter and softer   unsure why i am comparing the both but i suppose i have to compare their pros and cons as they do have the same concept   fresh  simple  affordable quick burger   didn t try the milkshake or fries so will definitely be coming back to taste them next   great stuff 
680	2.0	There always seems to be a queue here, though it has calmed down from the buzz that seemed to come with it. Like the farore an A list Hollywood star brings with when it arrives at Leicester Sq this was one of the most talked about, Instagramed places I think I'd seen when it first opened.The good thing I found, and I will start with the good is that the drinks machine is like a charlie and chocolate factory treasure trove of drinks. Cherry Vanilla Coke? Yes please. Fun arrives in fizzy form. That is where it excelled.In terms of the food. Well, it's expensive. Very expensive. I thought this was supposed to be an American fast food joint. This isn't at American prices that's for sure. And none with the fries included. For such a high price id expect it for gourmet burgers but it already got me annoyed but I'd braved the queue this far. The burger has loads of free toppings you can get and of course this clever device really adds to the burger because it needs it. It does however make this the most messy burger I've ever had. Falling all over the place, and breaking the bun at that.I mean I wanted to like it. Whether it was hyped or not I expected am Americana burger. I suppose I got it. Not in price, but the down and dirty burger it actually is. However, it's not great and didn't sing the praises of the meat. It hides behind its toppings that come with it. Shakeshack its main rival makes the meat for of a hero in my opinion much more. Overall the burger scene has exploded in London, so I've stayed away from places like this for places like Patty & Bun, Honest or my all time fav, Bleecker St Burger.	there always seems to be a queue here  though it has calmed down from the buzz that seemed to come with it  like the farore an a list hollywood star brings with when it arrives at leicester sq this was one of the most talked about  instagramed places i think i d seen when it first opened the good thing i found  and i will start with the good is that the drinks machine is like a charlie and chocolate factory treasure trove of drinks  cherry vanilla coke  yes please  fun arrives in fizzy form  that is where it excelled in terms of the food  well  it s expensive  very expensive  i thought this was supposed to be an american fast food joint  this isn t at american prices that s for sure  and none with the fries included  for such a high price id expect it for gourmet burgers but it already got me annoyed but i d braved the queue this far  the burger has loads of free toppings you can get and of course this clever device really adds to the burger because it needs it  it does however make this the most messy burger i ve ever had  falling all over the place  and breaking the bun at that i mean i wanted to like it  whether it was hyped or not i expected am americana burger  i suppose i got it  not in price  but the down and dirty burger it actually is  however  it s not great and didn t sing the praises of the meat  it hides behind its toppings that come with it  shakeshack its main rival makes the meat for of a hero in my opinion much more  overall the burger scene has exploded in london  so i ve stayed away from places like this for places like patty   bun  honest or my all time fav  bleecker st burger 
681	3.0	I had high expectations because of all the newspaper reviews hanging on the wall in the restroom area, and also because I have heard about Five guys before.The burger tastes like a hamburger from McDonald's, which is not a bad thing, I like them, but for the price paid I expected more, a 'proper burger tasting' burger. The cayenne fries were ok, but a little bit spicy. What I was most impressed by, was the machine to refill drinks. You can chose Coke, Fanta Sprite and other soft drinks and combine them with fruity flavours like strawberry, orange, raspberry and so on. I have never seen so many combinations of soft drinks, very impressive:). Over all, I would come back, but with lower expectations.	i had high expectations because of all the newspaper reviews hanging on the wall in the restroom area  and also because i have heard about five guys before the burger tastes like a hamburger from mcdonald s  which is not a bad thing  i like them  but for the price paid i expected more  a  proper burger tasting  burger  the cayenne fries were ok  but a little bit spicy  what i was most impressed by  was the machine to refill drinks  you can chose coke  fanta sprite and other soft drinks and combine them with fruity flavours like strawberry  orange  raspberry and so on  i have never seen so many combinations of soft drinks  very impressive    over all  i would come back  but with lower expectations 
682	3.0	Hmm, the shine of Five Guys is wearing off for me, I'm afraid!I have always found the fries too salty, the cajun ones nearly inedibly so. The service was fine, but the food came out too quickly. All I did was order, leaving my other half upstairs while I went down to get the drink filled and grab a seat. The Freestyle machine crapped out halfway through pouring my cherry Coke, so I had to get the rest of it with just Coke (but it was working when we refilled it). I had barely sat down and my husband came down with the food. Odd, as the hot dogs always take longer than the burgers.The cheese didn't even melt on it properly (normally it's a messy puddle) and the hot dog, while not cold, was not hot. Edible, yes, but without the extra tastiness I had come to expect. I only ate half of it, and a handful of the salt-encrusted fries, before I called it a day.That being said, when we left just gone 6, there was a queue waiting to get in, so I'm clearly in the minority.	hmm  the shine of five guys is wearing off for me  i m afraid i have always found the fries too salty  the cajun ones nearly inedibly so  the service was fine  but the food came out too quickly  all i did was order  leaving my other half upstairs while i went down to get the drink filled and grab a seat  the freestyle machine crapped out halfway through pouring my cherry coke  so i had to get the rest of it with just coke  but it was working when we refilled it   i had barely sat down and my husband came down with the food  odd  as the hot dogs always take longer than the burgers the cheese didn t even melt on it properly  normally it s a messy puddle  and the hot dog  while not cold  was not hot  edible  yes  but without the extra tastiness i had come to expect  i only ate half of it  and a handful of the salt encrusted fries  before i called it a day that being said  when we left just gone 6  there was a queue waiting to get in  so i m clearly in the minority

But despite my illness and being appalling company that night (sorry sweety!) I definitely appreciated the food. The peanutty taste in those beautifully soft burgers were divine, and everything else about them (the size, the cheese, those gorgeous bacon pieces which boggled my mind how they were even made) were beyond on-point.They have a drinks machine where you can choose between 100+ soft drinks combinations. This seriously has to be seen to be believed! There were so many things I wanted to try! And had my belly been feeling right I would have. Settled for some tasty Coke & Lime in the end (always was a fave of mine).Grateful to Five Guys for making my boyf a happy man (he is seriously your fanboy). And really appreciated the burger I had there. His recommendation of your burgers being the best was beyond mere fanboyism though, their amazingness is beyond ambiguity~!	my boyfriend told me this place was da bomb  and he was right  i feel bad i couldn t have appreciated it more when he took me  was feeling pretty ill  worst timing ever    but despite my illness and being appalling company that night  sorry sweety   i definitely appreciated the food  the peanutty taste in those beautifully soft burgers were divine  and everything else about them  the size  the cheese  those gorgeous bacon pieces which boggled my mind how they were even made  were beyond on point they have a drinks machine where you can choose between 100  soft drinks combinations  this seriously has to be seen to be believed  there were so many things i wanted to try  and had my belly been feeling right i would have  settled for some tasty coke   lime in the end  always was a fave of mine  grateful to five guys for making my boyf a happy man  he is seriously your fanboy   and really appreciated the burger i had there  his recommendation of your burgers being the best was beyond mere fanboyism though  their amazingness is beyond ambiguity  
684	4.0	I've heard people raving about Five Guys so as we were in the area looking for a bite to eat and there wasn't a massive queue, we decided to give it a try. I was very impressed. There's free monkey nuts for a start! The burger was a little greasier than I'd like but it was soooo tasty and I'd definitely recommend getting chips - you get loads (we went for large but there were loads more than I imagined) , they have their skin on and they're coated with something delicious - maybe a bit of paprika.You choose the burger you want - hamburger, cheeseburger, burger with bacon etc then as many of the toppings as you want for no extra charge. You can get a drink for £2.50 which you can refill for free too.The restaurant has a fun American diner style and we sat downstairs in a really cute little booth.It's pretty good value for money and really tasty.

685	5.0	"If you're a fan of big American burgers, then you don't need to look any further than this place!The menu for Five Guys is rather small, but each item is great in it's own way, the flagship item has to be their burgers, you can choose to have it exactly how you want, whether it be just a small hamburger with a little bit of ketchup or a bacon cheeseburger with all the extras. Hot dogs are also available, but I have yet to try them.For vegetarians, there's a choice of grilled cheese sandwiches and fries which come in either ""Five Guys style"" (which are chunky and very fresh as they're made in-store) or Cajun style (same chunky and fresh fries but with a spicy salt added) which are both fried in Peanut oil for extra flavour.They do have a small selection of beers and special flavoured milkshakes, both of which I have yet to try because each Five Guys store has a Coca-Cola Freestyle drinks machine, where you can choose the usual Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite or Fanta, but what makes it special is that you can add flavourings to the drinks, for example you can have Coca-Cola with Lime or Diet Coke with Vanilla, there's over 100 different drinks combinations to choose from.Ideally, it'd make a great date meal, if fact I took my girlfriend to her first Five Guys meal, she was very impressed, it's not too cheap, but it is also not excessively expensive."	if you re a fan of big american burgers  then you don t need to look any further than this place the menu for five guys is rather small  but each item is great in it s own way  the flagship item has to be their burgers  you can choose to have it exactly how you want  whether it be just a small hamburger with a little bit of ketchup or a bacon cheeseburger with all the extras  hot dogs are also available  but i have yet to try them for vegetarians  there s a choice of grilled cheese sandwiches and fries which come in either  five guys style   which are chunky and very fresh as they re made in store  or cajun style  same chunky and fresh fries but with a spicy salt added  which are both fried in peanut oil for extra flavour they do have a small selection of beers and special flavoured milkshakes  both of which i have yet to try because each five guys store has a coca cola freestyle drinks machine  where you can choose the usual coca cola  diet coke  sprite or fanta  but what makes it special is that you can add flavourings to the drinks  for example you can have coca cola with lime or diet coke with vanilla  there s over 100 different drinks combinations to choose from ideally  it d make a great date meal  if fact i took my girlfriend to her first five guys meal  she was very impressed  it s not too cheap  but it is also not excessively expensive

It's location right between Covent Garden and Leicester Square has always put me off a bit, purely on the basis of how crowded the area is after work and pre-theatre. I'm glad hunger called and I stopped in this time to give it a go.I ordered a standard burger with the works. And I mean, THE works. Oh and add a side of fries with that. I wasn't even hungry but I devoured the thing. It was delicious. Without the wrapper I probably wouldn't have guessed it was a chain burger. I wouldn't say gourmet, but not a chain. The meat was textured and had so much flavour, the bread was decent (not fantastic) and not soggy, but the fillings and sauces were the best part. Top it up with stuffings of Cajun skin-on fries, free buckets of peanuts in the shells and free refills of soda and you've got a pretty great, quick and casual dining experience. Forget date nights here but a good place for solo or casual friendly dining.

690	3.0	"I like this place, a lot. However, the reason it's not 4 stars but 3, is because, I don't think its burger is all that good, and that's terrible for a burger joint which came over here all the way from the US!If you like gadgety things, this place is great. It has the coke freestyle machine, which is widely available in the US but this machine is the first time I've seen one in the UK. What is a Coke freestyle machine, you cry? Well, it's a machine where you have lots of options to choose from, lots of cola drinks and flavours to choose from, and you can mix and match everything to your heart's desire, from Fanta to diet coke and vanilla coke and Raspberry this...to create either the best or worst drink ever. It's on tap by the way, so we are one step closer to matching the obesity crisis in the US!You get free peanuts while you wait, this is not new, they have them in GBK too but I think they must go through more crates here than in GBK. Their peanuts are nice and fresh, and makes waiting that much less painful.On the topic of waiting, you really shouldn't be waiting in the queue outside. The smart person would download the Five Guys UK app and order at least 10 minutes in advance (paying in advance), then casually stroll past the queue and go to the collection desk and query about your takeaway.OK, the moment of truth is the food. There are bazillion and one choices about your burger. You can add sauces, tomatoes, lettuce etc to your heart's content, or leave them out. The portions are US portions so I would recommend that you practise saying the word ""little"" rather than normal here if you have a small (aka UK) stomach. I gave this review 3 stars because the hype outlived the burger. It came in a foil wrap and by the time my party of 5 got our order, the burger/the bread seems to have shrunk a little under the heat. It was average tasting, but the feeling of eating a shrunk burger spoilt the experience.I cannot fault their cajun fries however, this is the best bit about this place other than the Coke Freestyle machine. The fries are very very addictive, although sometimes they are on the dry side. I have taken to ordering fries here and getting my burger from elsewhere at lunch.One last thing about their PR skills, I can say it was top notch. I actually queued for 1.5 hours here on the day of opening and then because my lunch time was over I had to give up. Their app was jammed by 1pm and you could not pre-order for takeaway using their mobile app. It was frustrating standing in a queue that wasn't moving whilst people who pre-ordered at around 12pm keep walking straight in. I wrote an email to complain and they offered us a free meal, literally a limitless tab, which of course, was a great gesture and a great response to their faulty opening date on 4 July 2013.Ok one last regret about this place, they do not have the secret menu like in the US, I wanted cheese fries!

691	3.0	I really wanted to try Five Guys last July when I was in London, however the queue was ridiculous and we had a show to catch, so I never got a chance to go. When I booked another trip to London this July, I was making sure that I'd get to try a Five Guys this time around.We headed to the restaurant for around 11:30 for a really early lunch (and to avoid any long queues).I ordered the cheeseburger (with lettuce, grilled onions and 'lite' ketchup), a little Five Guys fries and a drink. My partner also ordered the cheeseburger but got the little cajun fries instead.I was so excited when our order number got called. I opened the silver foil and inside was a burger that looked like the kind of burgers you see people eating on American TV shows; sloppy and oozing with gooey cheese.  It looked perfect. The taste, however, was not so perfect. The patty was quite bland as were the grilled onions. It wasn't the worst burger I've ever tasted but it certainly wasn't worth the price. We paid just short of £30 for the 2 fast food quality meals. There are much nicer burger joints in London for a similar price (or cheaper) and in future I'll be sticking to those when I visit.The fries were good, I think I preferred the cajun ones to the normal ones.Honestly, my favourite thing about Five Guys was the Freestyle Coke machine. I first tried this when I was in Orlando a couple of years ago and it wasn't something you could get in the UK until FG brought them into their restaurants. There are over 100+ combinations to make the perfect Coke drink for you! I recommend the raspberry coke or the vanilla & cherry coke! Actually, if it wasn't for the Freestyle Coke machine I might have just given this a 2 star review.	i really wanted to try five guys last july when i was in london  however the queue was ridiculous and we had a show to catch  so i never got a chance to go  when i booked another trip to london this july  i was making sure that i d get to try a five guys this time around we headed to the restaurant for around 11 30 for a really early lunch  and to avoid any long queues  i ordered the cheeseburger  with lettuce  grilled onions and  lite  ketchup   a little five guys fries and a drink  my partner also ordered the cheeseburger but got the little cajun fries instead i was so excited when our order number got called  i opened the silver foil and inside was a burger that looked like the kind of burgers you see people eating on american tv shows  sloppy and oozing with gooey cheese   it looked perfect  the taste  however  was not so perfect  the patty was quite bland as were the grilled onions  it wasn t the worst burger i ve ever tasted but it certainly wasn t worth the price  we paid just short of  30 for the 2 fast food quality meals  there are much nicer burger joints in london for a similar price  or cheaper  and in future i ll be sticking to those when i visit the fries were good  i think i preferred the cajun ones to the normal ones honestly  my favourite thing about five guys was the freestyle coke machine  i first tried this when i was in orlando a couple of years ago and it wasn t something you could get in the uk until fg brought them into their restaurants  there are over 100  combinations to make the perfect coke drink for you  i recommend the raspberry coke or the vanilla   cherry coke  actually  if it wasn t for the freestyle coke machine i might have just given this a 2 star review

While the food is very quick to be prepared for you so can be considered 'fast food', your burger is made to our order so is fresh and very efficient. You are paying a lot of money for your burger so you are obviously not getting McDonalds quality burgers (nothing against McDonalds, but you pay £1.29 for a basic burger so you get what you pay for)These burgers at Five guys are thick, juicy, high quality meat and with the added bonus of choosing as many sauces or extras in the burger for 'free'. Whether you like a simple burger or go crazy with everything on the menu, same price.The chips are amazing with the skin on, there are peanuts for free and the highlight is the drinks machine. Such a nice feature and with unlimited refills its a perfect complement to the meal.Definitely check it out, it need not be this location as it is a chain restaurant, but good quality burgers!	five guys is a well established chain burger restaurant with various locations across london  while the food is very quick to be prepared for you so can be considered  fast food   your burger is made to our order so is fresh and very efficient  you are paying a lot of money for your burger so you are obviously not getting mcdonalds quality burgers  nothing against mcdonalds  but you pay  1 29 for a basic burger so you get what you pay for these burgers at five guys are thick  juicy  high quality meat and with the added bonus of choosing as many sauces or extras in the burger for  free   whether you like a simple burger or go crazy with everything on the menu  same price the chips are amazing with the skin on  there are peanuts for free and the highlight is the drinks machine  such a nice feature and with unlimited refills its a perfect complement to the meal definitely check it out  it need not be this location as it is a chain restaurant  but good quality burgers 
693	5.0	Five Guys came very close, if not beat altogether, my all-time favourite of Shake Shack.  What I liked the most about Five Guys is that it stayed more true to classic burger than Shake Shack did -- no fancy mushroom-filled patty but just plain but solidly done slice of beef.  Second, I loved how you can choose unlimited number of other ingredients -- a rare deal in pricey Central London.  Last but not least, gotta love their soda machine -- who knew Sprite came in a dozen different flavours?!All around, it was a pleasant surprise.  I wish I had known about Five Guys sooner.	five guys came very close  if not beat altogether  my all time favourite of shake shack   what i liked the most about five guys is that it stayed more true to classic burger than shake shack did    no fancy mushroom filled patty but just plain but solidly done slice of beef   second  i loved how you can choose unlimited number of other ingredients    a rare deal in pricey central london   last but not least  gotta love their soda machine    who knew sprite came in a dozen different flavours  all around  it was a pleasant surprise   i wish i had known about five guys sooner 
694	3.0	Tired of hearing about Five Guys all the time from my friends who just had visited the US I was glad to find one in the UK to finally try this fantastic burger I was promised. Bad start, I was disappointed by the prices. I mean. What ? It's a fast food, and not a high-quality one with premium meats and cheese. I mean, although he burger *tastes* nice, it looks terrible in appearance. They don't even make the tiniest effort on presentation. Also the prices don't even include the fries or a drink. Good grief. The one very good thing is : they're fast at making them, and you get any free topping in your burger from a good variety. And as I said, the burger was good. The fries ? Nah, nothing too interesting over there. There's a lot of them for a meh quality. I'd rather have less with better taste. The place is quite big so I doubt you'll have a hard time finding a seat even when there's big affluence.	tired of hearing about five guys all the time from my friends who just had visited the us i was glad to find one in the uk to finally try this fantastic burger i was promised  bad start  i was disappointed by the prices  i mean  what   it s a fast food  and not a high quality one with premium meats and cheese  i mean  although he burger  tastes  nice  it looks terrible in appearance  they don t even make the tiniest effort on presentation  also the prices don t even include the fries or a drink  good grief  the one very good thing is   they re fast at making them  and you get any free topping in your burger from a good variety  and as i said  the burger was good  the fries   nah  nothing too interesting over there  there s a lot of them for a meh quality  i d rather have less with better taste  the place is quite big so i doubt you ll have a hard time finding a seat even when there s big affluence

So when we had 30 mins to kill before heading to another great Yelp! event at The Covent Garden Hotel, it shouldn't surprise you that we decided to finally give Five Guys a try.To start, there was no queue, which I've heard is a rarity. 6pm is obviously an unpopular time to get burgers, but it worked for us!On initial inspection, the burgers seem quite pricey. But if you take full advantage of the number of complimentary toppings available, it isn't so bad. Laura ordered a standard hamburger with lettuce, tomato and pickle, and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms salad and bbq sauce. We also ordered some fries and refillable drink to share. Total bill was about £20.I really enjoyed my burger. The bacon was crispy and flavoursome and the cheese and bbq sauce were excellent. It wasn't until I finished mine, and then ate the rest of Laura's that I realised how unseasoned and flavourless the patties are. They may be pure beef, and yes, there are two of them between the buns, but still, a bit of salt and pepper wouldn't go a miss.The fries on the other hand would benefit from less salt. Maybe if you put the fries IN your burger then it would be perfect?!So salty fries mean you need a drink and this is where Five Guys wins. There were flavours of pop I'd never even tried. Cherry Fanta was amazing!I'd happily go back again, but it still isn't the best burger in London!	if you ve read any of my other reviews  you ll know i m a big meat eater  so when we had 30 mins to kill before heading to another great yelp  event at the covent garden hotel  it shouldn t surprise you that we decided to finally give five guys a try to start  there was no queue  which i ve heard is a rarity  6pm is obviously an unpopular time to get burgers  but it worked for us on initial inspection  the burgers seem quite pricey  but if you take full advantage of the number of complimentary toppings available  it isn t so bad  laura ordered a standard hamburger with lettuce  tomato and pickle  and i ordered a bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms salad and bbq sauce  we also ordered some fries and refillable drink to share  total bill was about  20 i really enjoyed my burger  the bacon was crispy and flavoursome and the cheese and bbq sauce were excellent  it wasn t until i finished mine  and then ate the rest of laura s that i realised how unseasoned and flavourless the patties are  they may be pure beef  and yes  there are two of them between the buns  but still  a bit of salt and pepper wouldn t go a miss the fries on the other hand would benefit from less salt  maybe if you put the fries in your burger then it would be perfect  so salty fries mean you need a drink and this is where five guys wins  there were flavours of pop i d never even tried  cherry fanta was amazing i d happily go back again  but it still isn t the best burger in london 
696	5.0	"Well, I've taken my time getting round to this place, but I'm glad I did, there was a tiny queue outside, me, and after I walked in, a slightly less tiny queue and help yourself fresh peanuts.  The menu here is refreshingly simple, vegetarian orders aside and really why would you go to a burger bar for a veggie thing, you order a burger, cheese burger or cheese & bacon burger with or without fries, either cajun or normal.  Everything that goes in tht burger is down to you lettuce, pickle, tomato, mushrooms, fried or fresh onion, mayo sauces etc.  Then you wait with everyone else while they prepare your brown bagged waist extender.  It has a clean fresh ambience and of all the funky signs in there, the one that I liked the most said there wasn't a freezer on the premises.   I picked up my brown bag and as it was full upstairs, went down, where there was a lot more space, bigger tables and booths.  I had ordered my cheese and bacon burger with all the salady type stuff, pickle, mushrooms, ketchup and mayo.  It was vast.  Vast and delicious.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that in this area, it just beats the Meat Market Dead Hippy, the Byron Burger and the Smoke Shack. There was a wow factor about it, a simply ""F*** this is big; F*** this is good"" factor.  Cajun Fries are skin-on and dusted with what I think is salt and cayenne pepper.  They are also excellent and plentiful.  Plentiful as in if you finish your burger, you are probably not going to be able to finishe the fries.  I left not thinking that I had just spent over £11 on a burger and chips.   I left full, happy and wondering who I could bring here that doesn't already know about it.  In the end, I guess it doesn't get much better than that."	well  i ve taken my time getting round to this place  but i m glad i did  there was a tiny queue outside  me  and after i walked in  a slightly less tiny queue and help yourself fresh peanuts   the menu here is refreshingly simple  vegetarian orders aside and really why would you go to a burger bar for a veggie thing  you order a burger  cheese burger or cheese   bacon burger with or without fries  either cajun or normal   everything that goes in tht burger is down to you lettuce  pickle  tomato  mushrooms  fried or fresh onion  mayo sauces etc   then you wait with everyone else while they prepare your brown bagged waist extender   it has a clean fresh ambience and of all the funky signs in there  the one that i liked the most said there wasn t a freezer on the premises    i picked up my brown bag and as it was full upstairs  went down  where there was a lot more space  bigger tables and booths   i had ordered my cheese and bacon burger with all the salady type stuff  pickle  mushrooms  ketchup and mayo   it was vast   vast and delicious   i m going to go out on a limb here and say that in this area  it just beats the meat market dead hippy  the byron burger and the smoke shack  there was a wow factor about it  a simply  f    this is big  f    this is good  factor   cajun fries are skin on and dusted with what i think is salt and cayenne pepper   they are also excellent and plentiful   plentiful as in if you finish your burger  you are probably not going to be able to finishe the fries   i left not thinking that i had just spent over  11 on a burger and chips    i left full  happy and wondering who i could bring here that doesn t already know about it   in the end  i guess it doesn t get much better than that 
697	5.0	I really loved the burger and the fries. It all looked a bit messy, but thats how a burger at a fast food joint is allowed to look like :)The taste was amazing and the portion size (especially the fries) was huge.I went there after the movies around midnight and still there was a line up to the door. I walked by the place during the day when there was pretty heavy raining and the line even went around the corner!I hope Five Guys will open some joints in Germany any time soon. There is no way I would ever set a foot again in a McD when there is a Five Guys in an acceptable distance :)	i really loved the burger and the fries  it all looked a bit messy  but thats how a burger at a fast food joint is allowed to look like   the taste was amazing and the portion size  especially the fries  was huge i went there after the movies around midnight and still there was a line up to the door  i walked by the place during the day when there was pretty heavy raining and the line even went around the corner i hope five guys will open some joints in germany any time soon  there is no way i would ever set a foot again in a mcd when there is a five guys in an acceptable distance

The US legends have made it across the pond to deliver there amazing burgers are fries.Five Guys doesn't use refrigerators so the burgers are freshly prepared and Tate delicious.While the price is more Byron than McD's, the food is so worth it! Whatever you do, be sure to get the Cajun fries.

The burgers are just delicious, juicy and I love how you can add lots of different things to it to make it just how you want it. They always give you tons of fries so I would recommend only getting a small portion.The soda fountain is also great fun...the choice is huge!	love love love this place  we went 3 times to a five guys when in america this year so i was really excited when heard it opened in london  the burgers are just delicious  juicy and i love how you can add lots of different things to it to make it just how you want it  they always give you tons of fries so i would recommend only getting a small portion the soda fountain is also great fun   the choice is huge 
700	4.0	Given the hype over the American burger invasion I had to try Five Guys on a recent visit to Covent Garden.There was a fairly lengthy queue which was well managed both inside and outside of the premises. I ordered a hamburger as just as I like it (i.e. no toppings or sauce etc) along with fries which came to just under £10. The drinks looked pricey (£2.50 for unlimited coke) so I just filled up a water bottle like a cheapskate. Once an order is placed you hang around the counter until they call out your number.I had read some terrible reviews for Five Guys but I'm glad that I kept an open mind as though the food was pretty good. The presentation of the burger could have been better but that didn't really put me off. They even put an extra scoop of fries in the bag leaving me well fed.P.S there is plenty of seating downstairs	given the hype over the american burger invasion i had to try five guys on a recent visit to covent garden there was a fairly lengthy queue which was well managed both inside and outside of the premises  i ordered a hamburger as just as i like it  i e  no toppings or sauce etc  along with fries which came to just under  10  the drinks looked pricey   2 50 for unlimited coke  so i just filled up a water bottle like a cheapskate  once an order is placed you hang around the counter until they call out your number i had read some terrible reviews for five guys but i m glad that i kept an open mind as though the food was pretty good  the presentation of the burger could have been better but that didn t really put me off  they even put an extra scoop of fries in the bag leaving me well fed p s there is plenty of seating downstairs
701	3.0	Five Guys is certainly starting to expand and gain momentum in London, so I decided to pop in and give it a go. The Truth be told I have avoided the place after hearing some bad feedback from friends. I ordered a bacon cheese burger with bbq sauce and jalapeño peppers (all extra toppings are free) and some Cajun fries. The ordering and collection process was pretty smooth so I didn't have to wait long to get the food. It was a good burger but nothing special. The Cajun fries were tasty and you get a huge portion. However it wasn't really worth £13. My advice would be to go to GBK instead or get a dead hippie burger from MEATmission.	five guys is certainly starting to expand and gain momentum in london  so i decided to pop in and give it a go  the truth be told i have avoided the place after hearing some bad feedback from friends  i ordered a bacon cheese burger with bbq sauce and jalape o peppers  all extra toppings are free  and some cajun fries  the ordering and collection process was pretty smooth so i didn t have to wait long to get the food  it was a good burger but nothing special  the cajun fries were tasty and you get a huge portion  however it wasn t really worth  13  my advice would be to go to gbk instead or get a dead hippie burger from meatmission 
702	3.0	I only came in for a drink so I can't review anything else.  For £2.50 you get unlimited refills from the Coke Freesyle machines.  With over 100 different flavours you definitely get value for money.  Having recently used one in Florida I noticed that there are a few flavours missing, Mountain Dew and Root Beer for starters.  You can help yourself to free monkey nuts on entering too so definitely makes for a cheap visit.I wish they'd made this more like a 1950's diner with upholstered booths instead it's very wooden and has a bit of a clinical feel.  Like others have mentioned, it's definitely like going into a McDonalds.	i only came in for a drink so i can t review anything else   for  2 50 you get unlimited refills from the coke freesyle machines   with over 100 different flavours you definitely get value for money   having recently used one in florida i noticed that there are a few flavours missing  mountain dew and root beer for starters   you can help yourself to free monkey nuts on entering too so definitely makes for a cheap visit i wish they d made this more like a 1950 s diner with upholstered booths instead it s very wooden and has a bit of a clinical feel   like others have mentioned  it s definitely like going into a mcdonalds

You get to customize your burger which is great because I'm picky on what I like and I hate to be that person to bug about not putting stuff on it. They have those soda machines that let you pick lots of favors which is awesome. They also had peanuts you can snack on while wait. Very clean restaurant the employee came by every once in a while to clean. I would go again for a good burger and fries.	the burger was so tasty i was sad to finish it  you get to customize your burger which is great because i m picky on what i like and i hate to be that person to bug about not putting stuff on it  they have those soda machines that let you pick lots of favors which is awesome  they also had peanuts you can snack on while wait  very clean restaurant the employee came by every once in a while to clean  i would go again for a good burger and fries

Five Guys is big in the US and now they're over here  and I'm totally hooked!Their regular burgers come with a double patty but they also do 'little' burgers which are singles. You get a choice of hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger or bacon cheeseburger and then as many free toppings as you want including pickles, grilled onions, grilled peppers, jalapeños, lettuce, tomato and a few more. The fries aren't like the usual skinny pale fries you associate with American burger places, they're skin on chips which come in huge quantities and taste gorgeous. For £2.50 you get a refillable soft drink and with over 100 flavours to choose from, including raspberry coke and grape sprite, if you're anything like me you'll want to try as many of them as you can!	this place seriously does the best burgers in town  juicy  tasty and with a load of free toppings to choose from  what s not to love  five guys is big in the us and now they re over here  and i m totally hooked their regular burgers come with a double patty but they also do  little  burgers which are singles  you get a choice of hamburger  cheeseburger  bacon burger or bacon cheeseburger and then as many free toppings as you want including pickles  grilled onions  grilled peppers  jalape os  lettuce  tomato and a few more  the fries aren t like the usual skinny pale fries you associate with american burger places  they re skin on chips which come in huge quantities and taste gorgeous  for  2 50 you get a refillable soft drink and with over 100 flavours to choose from  including raspberry coke and grape sprite  if you re anything like me you ll want to try as many of them as you can

708	5.0	Returned for food and yes it was good. The chips are served in gigantic portions. The small would easily feed a person whilst the normal size feeds 2 easily. For the chips just go Cajun. You won't regret itAs a non beef eater the only thing I could get was the bLT sandwich. Which is actually served as a burger as opposed to a sandwich. This is clearly a place of happy deception. Everything is done to one-up your expectations and it works! The wait system is exactly like Argos. So much better than the ludicrous shake shack waits. I literally saw my burger being prepared as I ordered it. With it only taking 20 secs from paying to picking it all up!The one downside was the new member of staff. It was hard getting them to understand what a BLT was despite pointing frantically at the menu above their heads and explaining what the letters were for. Additionally when I said all the toppings, they took this to mean literally every topping including all the sauces. I removed some but it appears sine got through leaving me with a weird tasting but absolutely delicious bacon burger. The bacon in my burger was extra crisp. Not how I normally like it, but fine for what it was. The rest of the experience was on par with my previous review and they've just opened a branch closer to me in Islington. Sigh, the life of a foodie eh?	returned for food and yes it was good  the chips are served in gigantic portions  the small would easily feed a person whilst the normal size feeds 2 easily  for the chips just go cajun  you won t regret itas a non beef eater the only thing i could get was the blt sandwich  which is actually served as a burger as opposed to a sandwich  this is clearly a place of happy deception  everything is done to one up your expectations and it works  the wait system is exactly like argos  so much better than the ludicrous shake shack waits  i literally saw my burger being prepared as i ordered it  with it only taking 20 secs from paying to picking it all up the one downside was the new member of staff  it was hard getting them to understand what a blt was despite pointing frantically at the menu above their heads and explaining what the letters were for  additionally when i said all the toppings  they took this to mean literally every topping including all the sauces  i removed some but it appears sine got through leaving me with a weird tasting but absolutely delicious bacon burger  the bacon in my burger was extra crisp  not how i normally like it  but fine for what it was  the rest of the experience was on par with my previous review and they ve just opened a branch closer to me in islington  sigh  the life of a foodie eh 
709	4.0	First you start with the free peanuts while queuing and thinking about the burger you gonna get. If you are not too hungry just choose the little size (little burger, little bacon bacon or little cheeseburger with bacon.) which is already a good size burger especially if you add all the topping that you wants! The best in this burger is the bacon. It's crispy and go so well with the meat. Five guys was my first love with proper burger and I still like this place as their burger for me would always stay some pretty good burgers!	first you start with the free peanuts while queuing and thinking about the burger you gonna get  if you are not too hungry just choose the little size  little burger  little bacon bacon or little cheeseburger with bacon   which is already a good size burger especially if you add all the topping that you wants  the best in this burger is the bacon  it s crispy and go so well with the meat  five guys was my first love with proper burger and i still like this place as their burger for me would always stay some pretty good burgers 
710	5.0	Let's keep this simple- I love burgers, and I love Five Guys. While London is literally bursting with delicious burger joints, Five Guys is still king in my book.And this location keeps that title going strong.Despite being an ocean apart from its brothers, it's all basically perfect. The bun, the meat - hell, the *mayo* - it's all as it should be. The only caveat is the fries don't seem to be as dark and crispy; maybe they're not double-cooked? Who knows, but it's a small difference in a sea of flawless burger goodness.I've read a few snobby reviews of Five Guys in London, but if you trust your stomach (and the giant line outside) you can't go wrong.	let s keep this simple  i love burgers  and i love five guys  while london is literally bursting with delicious burger joints  five guys is still king in my book and this location keeps that title going strong despite being an ocean apart from its brothers  it s all basically perfect  the bun  the meat   hell  the  mayo    it s all as it should be  the only caveat is the fries don t seem to be as dark and crispy  maybe they re not double cooked  who knows  but it s a small difference in a sea of flawless burger goodness i ve read a few snobby reviews of five guys in london  but if you trust your stomach  and the giant line outside  you can t go wrong

712	4.0	I came here with both great excitement and great anxiousness, as I just moved from the states and have been craving Five Guys for quite a while now. I came last weekend, but the line was too long - so I tried again today... and success!I was already expecting the burgers not to be as good as the ones in America, just because London is at the early stages of a burger revolution and the Five Guys model isn't completely replicable across the pond. But, that being said, it came very close.Burger (7/10) - I would give American Five Guys burgers an 8/10, and this one came very close, though it wasn't exactly the same. As Edward said, it's going to be a sloppy burger, it's going to be greasy... but it's going to also be very good. This is the way a proper American burger should be! Dripping in grease, mayo, mushroom juice, melted cheese... etc. I agree that the price is a bit punchy, but the same thing at other burger joints (e.g. Byron) are easily over £15 per person for a lower quality burger.Fries (9/10) - This is where they got it right. The fries taste exactly the same as they do in the states. With the cajun seasoning, these babies are untouchable. Plus, you get the friendly extra scoop in the bag - so really you only need a small, and potentially a regular to split between two grown men. The taste is spot on, though you might need a drink handy.Drink fountain (10/10) - I was very worried that Five Guys would not bring the retro-futuristic drink fountains over... but they did! Over 100 different combinations of drinks you've only imagined at your fingertips. The only drawback is that the queue might get a bit long because there are so many choices and you want to try everything! In total it cost me  £14.50 for a cheeseburger (double-patty), regular fries (enough to feed two), and a drink. Well worth it, and it's about the price that I would pay for this quality burger in London. Will definitely be back.	i came here with both great excitement and great anxiousness  as i just moved from the states and have been craving five guys for quite a while now  i came last weekend  but the line was too long   so i tried again today    and success i was already expecting the burgers not to be as good as the ones in america  just because london is at the early stages of a burger revolution and the five guys model isn t completely replicable across the pond  but  that being said  it came very close burger  7 10    i would give american five guys burgers an 8 10  and this one came very close  though it wasn t exactly the same  as edward said  it s going to be a sloppy burger  it s going to be greasy    but it s going to also be very good  this is the way a proper american burger should be  dripping in grease  mayo  mushroom juice  melted cheese    etc  i agree that the price is a bit punchy  but the same thing at other burger joints  e g  byron  are easily over  15 per person for a lower quality burger fries  9 10    this is where they got it right  the fries taste exactly the same as they do in the states  with the cajun seasoning  these babies are untouchable  plus  you get the friendly extra scoop in the bag   so really you only need a small  and potentially a regular to split between two grown men  the taste is spot on  though you might need a drink handy drink fountain  10 10    i was very worried that five guys would not bring the retro futuristic drink fountains over    but they did  over 100 different combinations of drinks you ve only imagined at your fingertips  the only drawback is that the queue might get a bit long because there are so many choices and you want to try everything  in total it cost me   14 50 for a cheeseburger  double patty   regular fries  enough to feed two   and a drink  well worth it  and it s about the price that i would pay for this quality burger in london  will definitely be back

715	2.0	Very popular place by all accounts. But it doesn't hold a match to a local burger joint of mine in Dublin (Bunsen).Our server at the till was a little stroppy. No, I asked for onions, if I wanted grilled onions I would have said grilled onions.Burger was messy and chips ok. Decor I'd more associate with a McDonalds or a  Burger King. But with higher prices. That said you do get to fill up your drink as many times as you want. I wouldn't be rushing back.	very popular place by all accounts  but it doesn t hold a match to a local burger joint of mine in dublin  bunsen  our server at the till was a little stroppy  no  i asked for onions  if i wanted grilled onions i would have said grilled onions burger was messy and chips ok  decor i d more associate with a mcdonalds or a  burger king  but with higher prices  that said you do get to fill up your drink as many times as you want  i wouldn t be rushing back 
716	4.0	Update!Five Guys now serves shakes. Expensive shakes in gosh darn fancy flavours with a choice of bacon, yes, BACON. I'll try it if you promise not to judge me.I don't want to be the person rooting for the big guys and throwing the independent burger joints under the routemaster but this place is pretty good and I'm literally only taking away a star because the queues are ridiculous and there's basically never any seating and because it's pretty expensive for what it is... a glorified McDonalds.I came here on the behest of my partner who is American and a big fan of this place back home. Naturally, when I told her Shake Shack and Five Guys had branched out to the promised land, she insisted I go. Being an excellent girlfriend, I did! I had gone to Shake Shack before and didn't have high hopes for Five Guys. It seemed all was lost when the queue stretched for as far as the eye could see. OK, so it was contained within the premises but still, it was HUGE. I ordered a large fries, a bottomless drink and a standard burger with my choice of toppings... because you have the choice and it's all included in the price so go nuts people! It came to about £12 altogether. While I waited for my order to be called I grabbed a drink from the self serve machines because, guys... let's be real, you need to drink as much as you can because that thing costs like £3 so don't be insane and buy two if you're going with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Buy one and share because it's BOTTOMLESS. We all know you don't think it's gross so don't pretend! Grab some ketchup while you wait too. It took probably 10 minutes or so for my food to arrive and it was a pretty gruelling wait as I pranced around giving people death glares in the hopes of stealing a seat from one of the weaker patrons. I grabbed my food as soon as it was called up and sat back down, making sure to throw in a couple more stone cold glares just for good measure. What can I say. I know that it's just a burger and that I shouldn't get my panties in a twist but after my less than amazing experience at Shake Shack, I thought that this thing was the best burger I had ever tasted. It isn't, but in that moment it was the burger that fell out of a unicorn's bottom. The patties were juicy, the toppings were generous and I was finally able to get a beautifully cooked burger with plenty of toppings WITHOUT cheese. You'd think I was asking for the moon but it's incredibly difficult to go to a place with a standard menu and ask for a fancily-named-touched-by-the-gods burger with no cheese. The fries were great and I felt greedy for ordering a large as a small would have been more than enough for me. Bottomless soda people... why isn't this a thing in the UK already? Although the burgers are good, for the money, it's not entirely a bad idea to just walk around the corner into Soho and sit down at Honest Burgers or dash a bit further posh side (West) and grab a burger at Patty and Bun. Update: This place has really grown on me. The food is consistently good. The queues however are consistently long. Consider visiting the Argyll Street branch for an easier experience. Shakes are small for the pice but no pricier than other places. Getting a soft drink is still a better bet because bottomless.	update five guys now serves shakes  expensive shakes in gosh darn fancy flavours with a choice of bacon  yes  bacon  i ll try it if you promise not to judge me i don t want to be the person rooting for the big guys and throwing the independent burger joints under the routemaster but this place is pretty good and i m literally only taking away a star because the queues are ridiculous and there s basically never any seating and because it s pretty expensive for what it is    a glorified mcdonalds i came here on the behest of my partner who is american and a big fan of this place back home  naturally  when i told her shake shack and five guys had branched out to the promised land  she insisted i go  being an excellent girlfriend  i did  i had gone to shake shack before and didn t have high hopes for five guys  it seemed all was lost when the queue stretched for as far as the eye could see  ok  so it was contained within the premises but still  it was huge  i ordered a large fries  a bottomless drink and a standard burger with my choice of toppings    because you have the choice and it s all included in the price so go nuts people  it came to about  12 altogether  while i waited for my order to be called i grabbed a drink from the self serve machines because  guys    let s be real  you need to drink as much as you can because that thing costs like  3 so don t be insane and buy two if you re going with your girlfriend boyfriend  buy one and share because it s bottomless  we all know you don t think it s gross so don t pretend  grab some ketchup while you wait too  it took probably 10 minutes or so for my food to arrive and it was a pretty gruelling wait as i pranced around giving people death glares in the hopes of stealing a seat from one of the weaker patrons  i grabbed my food as soon as it was called up and sat back down  making sure to throw in a couple more stone cold glares just for good measure  what can i say  i know that it s just a burger and that i shouldn t get my panties in a twist but after my less than amazing experience at shake shack  i thought that this thing was the best burger i had ever tasted  it isn t  but in that moment it was the burger that fell out of a unicorn s bottom  the patties were juicy  the toppings were generous and i was finally able to get a beautifully cooked burger with plenty of toppings without cheese  you d think i was asking for the moon but it s incredibly difficult to go to a place with a standard menu and ask for a fancily named touched by the gods burger with no cheese  the fries were great and i felt greedy for ordering a large as a small would have been more than enough for me  bottomless soda people    why isn t this a thing in the uk already  although the burgers are good  for the money  it s not entirely a bad idea to just walk around the corner into soho and sit down at honest burgers or dash a bit further posh side  west  and grab a burger at patty and bun  update  this place has really grown on me  the food is consistently good  the queues however are consistently long  consider visiting the argyll street branch for an easier experience  shakes are small for the pice but no pricier than other places  getting a soft drink is still a better bet because bottomless 
717	3.0	This is exactly what you would expect from an American chain coming into London. MASSIVE chips (not even joking but the large could feed a family of 4), brilliant juicy burgers and hotdogs that scream America. The decor is a mash of white and red (similar to In-and-Out) with the walls plastered in quotes from magazines they were featured in within the States. Although I am not quite sure the press clippings are 100% necessary, it is a big space and great for families. Great for groups of friends wanting a relaxing atmosphere to sit for a couple hours, slowly devouring the mountain of chips and endless supply of soda.	this is exactly what you would expect from an american chain coming into london  massive chips  not even joking but the large could feed a family of 4   brilliant juicy burgers and hotdogs that scream america  the decor is a mash of white and red  similar to in and out  with the walls plastered in quotes from magazines they were featured in within the states  although i am not quite sure the press clippings are 100  necessary  it is a big space and great for families  great for groups of friends wanting a relaxing atmosphere to sit for a couple hours  slowly devouring the mountain of chips and endless supply of soda 
718	3.0	I actually only came here because my first choice for dinner was full and I was starving. Fries are delicious (plus they give you extra in the bag) and I do like having so many topping choices. Burger is decent, definitely better than McDonalds but only slightly. For the price I would expect a much better bun that doesn't get so soggy. Also the grilled cheese has lettuce in it, which I do not understand. I've never seen grilled cheese with lettuce it just sounds off. If they are going for American classic they are not doing it right.To me, Five Guys is a familiar spot since there are plenty in my hometown so it's a safe choice for food. Walking in here felt like I was back in the US. This is a good place for a quick bite to eat but honestly there are much better burgers in the area.	i actually only came here because my first choice for dinner was full and i was starving  fries are delicious  plus they give you extra in the bag  and i do like having so many topping choices  burger is decent  definitely better than mcdonalds but only slightly  for the price i would expect a much better bun that doesn t get so soggy  also the grilled cheese has lettuce in it  which i do not understand  i ve never seen grilled cheese with lettuce it just sounds off  if they are going for american classic they are not doing it right to me  five guys is a familiar spot since there are plenty in my hometown so it s a safe choice for food  walking in here felt like i was back in the us  this is a good place for a quick bite to eat but honestly there are much better burgers in the area 
719	1.0	I don't get the fuss. Ruddy expensive for what is essentially a pretty ordinary burger. I got the cheeseburger, at £8, added fries for £4 and a drink brought the bill up to £14.50. For that I would have expected a lot more. It's not even as though the experience is the thing. Plain interior designed to look kind of austere I suppose, but the music is way too loud and the staff - the cohort of them - seem to think they are at a dance party not flipping burgers. I expect this place will go the way of so many of these American imports. Be popular in the short term, but then die a slow death once we all wise up. Do it once, if you must! As for me, the pub across the road is looking delightful right now.	i don t get the fuss  ruddy expensive for what is essentially a pretty ordinary burger  i got the cheeseburger  at  8  added fries for  4 and a drink brought the bill up to  14 50  for that i would have expected a lot more  it s not even as though the experience is the thing  plain interior designed to look kind of austere i suppose  but the music is way too loud and the staff   the cohort of them   seem to think they are at a dance party not flipping burgers  i expect this place will go the way of so many of these american imports  be popular in the short term  but then die a slow death once we all wise up  do it once  if you must  as for me  the pub across the road is looking delightful right now

The staff were friendly and explained everything clearly (especially about the size of the fries! My friend wanted the large fries to himself but it was definitely too many for one person! We shared and still had some left over...)I'd also go the full sh-bang and get the unlimited refills of drinks as there are loads to choose from.The only thing is it's a little on the pricey side for a fast-food place.	a great fast food burger place tasty burgers where you can have as many toppings as you like at no extra cost which is a fantastic bonus  the staff were friendly and explained everything clearly  especially about the size of the fries  my friend wanted the large fries to himself but it was definitely too many for one person  we shared and still had some left over    i d also go the full sh bang and get the unlimited refills of drinks as there are loads to choose from the only thing is it s a little on the pricey side for a fast food place

723	4.0	I finally made my first trip to Five Guys about four months after opening? Why? I hate queues. In my experience, queuing for food is rarely worth it? So would it be worth it at Five Guys?Luckily, when we decided to come (before a nearby show), the queue was relatively short. Only about 10 people outside. Thanks goodness! We grabbed some nuts once we got inside to nibble on while we were in the inside queue.One huge issue I have with Five Guys is the fiddliness. It's just plain fiddly. Too many choices. What do I do with that? I order everything. Well that's not true. I didn't want all the sauces. So I ordered all the veggies. Since I had jalapenos on my burger, I went for mayo and hot sauce as well. We also got cajun fries to go along side. I got a soda and the other half ordered a Brooklyn Lager. I had a raspberry coke zero and dr. pepper zero while I was there. The soda machine is pretty dang cool with all the options. The burgers are pretty good. I mean, there are better burgers in London if you have the time, but for a quick bite to eat, they are pretty good. I was expecting mine to be a bit spicier given the jalapenos and hot sauce. All the toppings does make for a bit of a messy burger, but if you go slow you can avoid some of it. The chips were pretty mediocre. They were undercooked and overseasoned. That was an unfortunate downside to the whole meal.So I say Five Guys burgers are a solid three stars. I'm giving them an extra star for the soda machine and free peanuts. It's a nice touch. I'm not sure how many times I'll be back when I know I can get better food for the same price or cheaper at other locations, but if I need a quick bite, I will probably keep it in mind.	i finally made my first trip to five guys about four months after opening  why  i hate queues  in my experience  queuing for food is rarely worth it  so would it be worth it at five guys luckily  when we decided to come  before a nearby show   the queue was relatively short  only about 10 people outside  thanks goodness  we grabbed some nuts once we got inside to nibble on while we were in the inside queue one huge issue i have with five guys is the fiddliness  it s just plain fiddly  too many choices  what do i do with that  i order everything  well that s not true  i didn t want all the sauces  so i ordered all the veggies  since i had jalapenos on my burger  i went for mayo and hot sauce as well  we also got cajun fries to go along side  i got a soda and the other half ordered a brooklyn lager  i had a raspberry coke zero and dr  pepper zero while i was there  the soda machine is pretty dang cool with all the options  the burgers are pretty good  i mean  there are better burgers in london if you have the time  but for a quick bite to eat  they are pretty good  i was expecting mine to be a bit spicier given the jalapenos and hot sauce  all the toppings does make for a bit of a messy burger  but if you go slow you can avoid some of it  the chips were pretty mediocre  they were undercooked and overseasoned  that was an unfortunate downside to the whole meal so i say five guys burgers are a solid three stars  i m giving them an extra star for the soda machine and free peanuts  it s a nice touch  i m not sure how many times i ll be back when i know i can get better food for the same price or cheaper at other locations  but if i need a quick bite  i will probably keep it in mind

725	3.0	"Finally, after months I have finally made it to Five Guys in Covent Garden. For me, this place feels like an average diner, and the constant floor cleaning - in part necessary due to the free peanuts - really annoyed me and made the place remind me more of a McDonald's than anything else. Their system is clever - let people order, and then let them wait after they have ordered. I was there on a Tuesday evening and it was not too busy, so I cannot really complain, at least I did not have to wait outside as is standard at some other popular places.To the food, I must say that I do not understand the hype. They do an average or even a good burger, yes, a little bit thin and dry, but in my opinion, their offering is simply overpriced (and overhyped). The star for me were the skin-on rosemary chips - they could have been more crunchy, but the taste was great. A funny feature, that might be kind of a unique selling point in London are the Coca Cola machines, where you can refill, and mix all kinds of drinks. But that is about it. Not sure how soon I will be back, I know quite a few places where I can get a better burger in a nicer environment for the same price - or less. Oh, and a sign in the toilet that says ""Employees must wash hands."" is either not funny, or concerning."	finally  after months i have finally made it to five guys in covent garden  for me  this place feels like an average diner  and the constant floor cleaning   in part necessary due to the free peanuts   really annoyed me and made the place remind me more of a mcdonald s than anything else  their system is clever   let people order  and then let them wait after they have ordered  i was there on a tuesday evening and it was not too busy  so i cannot really complain  at least i did not have to wait outside as is standard at some other popular places to the food  i must say that i do not understand the hype  they do an average or even a good burger  yes  a little bit thin and dry  but in my opinion  their offering is simply overpriced  and overhyped   the star for me were the skin on rosemary chips   they could have been more crunchy  but the taste was great  a funny feature  that might be kind of a unique selling point in london are the coca cola machines  where you can refill  and mix all kinds of drinks  but that is about it  not sure how soon i will be back  i know quite a few places where i can get a better burger in a nicer environment for the same price   or less  oh  and a sign in the toilet that says  employees must wash hands   is either not funny  or concerning 
726	2.0	My recommendation is to have a GBK, Hache or Byron's and most definitely any other similarly priced burger joint that I've not tried yet which taste even better as I'm sure I've only just dipped my toe in what London can offer. I feel bad for asking my friend to take me there for my birthday treat. The fries managed to be crispy and limp at the same time and the burgers were just a Macdonalds burger on steroids. There is a reason why the main comparison in most reviews is with Macdonalds. Which has surely got to ring some alarm bells? I realise Five Guys is supposed to be a fast food experience but it took just as long as a similarly priced sit-down burger meal. So why do they charge sit down prices for fast food burgers? I'm glad we were advised on the sizing of the fries as I rarely finish a portion - I didn't much fancy eating more than a few of these. The burger was very greasy and had a strange added beef taste rather than tasting like beef which I was expect from Mcdonalds etc. We had cheeseburgers and I added ketchup, mustard, pickles and mushrooms. All in all, in comparison to Macdonalds, Five Guys is excellent. However I can't compare it to Macdonalds as the price points are different. So to compare to similarly priced burgers? There is a huge problem.The drinks machine is groovy though.	my recommendation is to have a gbk  hache or byron s and most definitely any other similarly priced burger joint that i ve not tried yet which taste even better as i m sure i ve only just dipped my toe in what london can offer  i feel bad for asking my friend to take me there for my birthday treat  the fries managed to be crispy and limp at the same time and the burgers were just a macdonalds burger on steroids  there is a reason why the main comparison in most reviews is with macdonalds  which has surely got to ring some alarm bells  i realise five guys is supposed to be a fast food experience but it took just as long as a similarly priced sit down burger meal  so why do they charge sit down prices for fast food burgers  i m glad we were advised on the sizing of the fries as i rarely finish a portion   i didn t much fancy eating more than a few of these  the burger was very greasy and had a strange added beef taste rather than tasting like beef which i was expect from mcdonalds etc  we had cheeseburgers and i added ketchup  mustard  pickles and mushrooms  all in all  in comparison to macdonalds  five guys is excellent  however i can t compare it to macdonalds as the price points are different  so to compare to similarly priced burgers  there is a huge problem the drinks machine is groovy though 
727	5.0	"My excitement for the opening of Five Guys in London was a little bit over-the-top I have to admit.  I even organised mates to come along on the 4th of July ""because whether you know it or not (and you better believe it), this is one of the best honest-to-goodness burgers ever"".  In the end, only my friend Cristina and her son Cai came along for the ride.  I did not expect to find a very long queue... all for a new burger!  I wasn't the only over-the-top burger fan after all.  The queuing lasted an hour and 20 minutes before the three of us finally got in.I waited patiently for my orders to be prepared.  It was literally prepared by five guys!  I'm sure it was coincidence.I was glad that Five Guys stayed true to the concept that is similar to what I've experienced in Brooklyn (my very first Five Guys burger).  Free peanuts with crunchy shells and bottomless drinks.  Bottomless drinks is not new in London but certainly not common.  But what's very exciting in Five Guys are the Fountain Soda machines.  I swear there were more than 25 drinks (at least) to choose from.  An irish guy (couldn't go wrong with that beautiful accent) behind me gave a wonderful tip.  Mix anything with vanilla and it will be fabulous!  I tried raspberry and vanilla to amazing effect.  I made several trips to the soda machine which unfortunately bloated me a bit.As for the burgers, it was as I remember it in New York. Perfect soft bread that hug the patties nicely.  The seasoning of the meat was perfect.  Not too salty nor bland.  The extras on my bacon cheeseburger were grilled mushroom, jalapeño, tomatoes, hot sauce and pickles.  Pondering on it, I think if I were to choose my last meal on earth, this one could come to mind.The challenge in multiplying branches of a successful company is that sometimes, the specialised process of creating the product becomes formulaic but subject to different results.  I was a little disheartened a few months ago when I visited a California branch of Five Guys in Fullerton.  The quality of my burger over there was somehow different.  It must have been an isolated case of lapse in quality control (I would hope).  I can gladly say that the London version totally reminded me of why I still rate Five Guys as one of my top burgers."	my excitement for the opening of five guys in london was a little bit over the top i have to admit   i even organised mates to come along on the 4th of july  because whether you know it or not  and you better believe it   this is one of the best honest to goodness burgers ever    in the end  only my friend cristina and her son cai came along for the ride   i did not expect to find a very long queue    all for a new burger   i wasn t the only over the top burger fan after all   the queuing lasted an hour and 20 minutes before the three of us finally got in i waited patiently for my orders to be prepared   it was literally prepared by five guys   i m sure it was coincidence i was glad that five guys stayed true to the concept that is similar to what i ve experienced in brooklyn  my very first five guys burger    free peanuts with crunchy shells and bottomless drinks   bottomless drinks is not new in london but certainly not common   but what s very exciting in five guys are the fountain soda machines   i swear there were more than 25 drinks  at least  to choose from   an irish guy  couldn t go wrong with that beautiful accent  behind me gave a wonderful tip   mix anything with vanilla and it will be fabulous   i tried raspberry and vanilla to amazing effect   i made several trips to the soda machine which unfortunately bloated me a bit as for the burgers  it was as i remember it in new york  perfect soft bread that hug the patties nicely   the seasoning of the meat was perfect   not too salty nor bland   the extras on my bacon cheeseburger were grilled mushroom  jalape o  tomatoes  hot sauce and pickles   pondering on it  i think if i were to choose my last meal on earth  this one could come to mind the challenge in multiplying branches of a successful company is that sometimes  the specialised process of creating the product becomes formulaic but subject to different results   i was a little disheartened a few months ago when i visited a california branch of five guys in fullerton   the quality of my burger over there was somehow different   it must have been an isolated case of lapse in quality control  i would hope    i can gladly say that the london version totally reminded me of why i still rate five guys as one of my top burgers 
728	3.0	HELLO TOPPINGS.  I get really excited when I have the opportunity to customize my food.When I had my Five Guys obsession in the States, that was always one brownie point I appreciated.  I still preferred Shake Shack over Five Guys (get your soppy bun together though SS...), but I love that Five Guys' topping permutation can get quite eclectic.  You can choose regular/grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, lettuce, jalapeno, pickles, green peppers, relish, mayo, mustard, A1 sauce, HP sauce, BBQ sauce, Tabasco sauce, ketchup, or THE WORKS if you are greedy and want everything (done that and it gets messy).There was still a line to get into the restaurant at 10 pm but it went much quicker than the line at Shake Shack.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger (double patties, cheese, and bacon), regular sized Cajun fries (go for Cajun if you prefer spicy and seasoned fries), and fountain drink which I promptly filled up with Orange Coke Zero (unadvised) from the soda machine that churns out various flavors of your favorite Coca-Cola sponsored beverage.  All amounting to about 12 quid.  During the 10 minute wait to get my food, I hovered around the free peanuts but thought better of it as I had a feast awaiting.Upon receiving the meal, I was excited to see that bun was toasted even if it quickly became soppy after a few minutes. The burger was good, though I think the meat at Shake Shack tastes better.  The fries were a bit limp and sad.  They supposedly double/triple fry their fries, but the texture tends to be inconsistent.Overall I like Five Guys.  I'd just go for Shake Shack instead if I were in the area again.	hello toppings   i get really excited when i have the opportunity to customize my food when i had my five guys obsession in the states  that was always one brownie point i appreciated   i still preferred shake shack over five guys  get your soppy bun together though ss      but i love that five guys  topping permutation can get quite eclectic   you can choose regular grilled onions  grilled mushrooms  tomato  lettuce  jalapeno  pickles  green peppers  relish  mayo  mustard  a1 sauce  hp sauce  bbq sauce  tabasco sauce  ketchup  or the works if you are greedy and want everything  done that and it gets messy  there was still a line to get into the restaurant at 10 pm but it went much quicker than the line at shake shack   i chose the bacon cheeseburger  double patties  cheese  and bacon   regular sized cajun fries  go for cajun if you prefer spicy and seasoned fries   and fountain drink which i promptly filled up with orange coke zero  unadvised  from the soda machine that churns out various flavors of your favorite coca cola sponsored beverage   all amounting to about 12 quid   during the 10 minute wait to get my food  i hovered around the free peanuts but thought better of it as i had a feast awaiting upon receiving the meal  i was excited to see that bun was toasted even if it quickly became soppy after a few minutes  the burger was good  though i think the meat at shake shack tastes better   the fries were a bit limp and sad   they supposedly double triple fry their fries  but the texture tends to be inconsistent overall i like five guys   i d just go for shake shack instead if i were in the area again 
729	4.0	There's been quite a lot of hype around Five Guys, and well, I think much of it is justified. The interior may be similar to McDonalds in some ways, but in all other ways the comparison is completely off: the quality of the burger and chips is immeasurably better, and I love the option to order as many or as few sauces as one wants. The prices may be rather higher for the £8 double patty burger, but it's very filling too (far more so than a Big Mac) - the smaller, single patty burger for £5 should not be overlooked in your quest to satisfy your hunger. Five Guys also deserve credit for using and preparing their burgers freshly - something that McDonalds certainly cannot claim to do.There are oddities and inconveniences here too. Chief oddity is all the endorsements on the wall from little-known US regional publications.. circa 2008 (?!). Chief inconvenience is the wait, both to get into the restaurant (a rope and door attendant regulates access) and to be served. So you may want to pick your moment to sample what Five Guys have to offer. Overall though, Five Guys are definitely worth checking out. And as a new entry in London's already saturated burger market, that's saying something.	there s been quite a lot of hype around five guys  and well  i think much of it is justified  the interior may be similar to mcdonalds in some ways  but in all other ways the comparison is completely off  the quality of the burger and chips is immeasurably better  and i love the option to order as many or as few sauces as one wants  the prices may be rather higher for the  8 double patty burger  but it s very filling too  far more so than a big mac    the smaller  single patty burger for  5 should not be overlooked in your quest to satisfy your hunger  five guys also deserve credit for using and preparing their burgers freshly   something that mcdonalds certainly cannot claim to do there are oddities and inconveniences here too  chief oddity is all the endorsements on the wall from little known us regional publications   circa 2008       chief inconvenience is the wait  both to get into the restaurant  a rope and door attendant regulates access  and to be served  so you may want to pick your moment to sample what five guys have to offer  overall though  five guys are definitely worth checking out  and as a new entry in london s already saturated burger market  that s saying something 
730	5.0	This IS expensive but you get what you pay for. I had a the large burger and fries with a bottomless drink for £12.50The burger was excellent and the amount of fries made me tear open the bag and use that to hold my fries. Well worth trying this if you have an hour to spare!	this is expensive but you get what you pay for  i had a the large burger and fries with a bottomless drink for  12 50the burger was excellent and the amount of fries made me tear open the bag and use that to hold my fries  well worth trying this if you have an hour to spare

732	5.0	This isn't easy... I debated if I could really give this (any) place 5/5. But the burger makes it impossible not to. Fantastic quality - yet simple. No point in saying more.Free monkey peanuts is another great feature. The vibe is good when you get a seat and it doesn't feel as rushed as some of these places tend to be.The only thing I would say is to avoid the Cajun Fries. They're good, but too dry and spicy (not too hot, just a lot of spice!).Actually, to keep this short - you're better off just getting two burgers. You will be back.	this isn t easy    i debated if i could really give this  any  place 5 5  but the burger makes it impossible not to  fantastic quality   yet simple  no point in saying more free monkey peanuts is another great feature  the vibe is good when you get a seat and it doesn t feel as rushed as some of these places tend to be the only thing i would say is to avoid the cajun fries  they re good  but too dry and spicy  not too hot  just a lot of spice   actually  to keep this short   you re better off just getting two burgers  you will be back

735	1.0	i didn't actually mean to go to five guys when i did, it's been on my list of places to go since it's opening but i was actually on my way to chipotle when i happened upon it and seeing as there was no queue i thought i had to give it a go! first impressions were good, everything is decked out in classic american burger joint fare with red and white adoring everything plus a peanut barrel for the hungry hoards in the queues. the menu is fairly straightforward but one of Five Guys USPs is that all the toppings are free and you can order whatever combinations take your fancy. I opted for a cheeseburger 'all the way' which essentially means containing all of the top row (lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mushrooms, ketchup,mustard and mayo) but i asked for no mustard and extra hot sauce and jalapenos.Once unwrapped, the burger is pretty impressive. I hadn't realised but two patties is standard and the cheese literally oozes out between the meat in the most tempting way imaginable! The burgers are real juicy as well, be warned you'll need about 3 napkins to get through one of these beasts! Sadly the actual eating part wasn't great, the meat is under seasoned, the hot sauce was fairly mild and watery for £10.50 i expected a lot better.Five Guys seemed a great place in theory but sadly didn't quite live up to the hype....	i didn t actually mean to go to five guys when i did  it s been on my list of places to go since it s opening but i was actually on my way to chipotle when i happened upon it and seeing as there was no queue i thought i had to give it a go  first impressions were good  everything is decked out in classic american burger joint fare with red and white adoring everything plus a peanut barrel for the hungry hoards in the queues  the menu is fairly straightforward but one of five guys usps is that all the toppings are free and you can order whatever combinations take your fancy  i opted for a cheeseburger  all the way  which essentially means containing all of the top row  lettuce  tomato  pickles  onions  mushrooms  ketchup mustard and mayo  but i asked for no mustard and extra hot sauce and jalapenos once unwrapped  the burger is pretty impressive  i hadn t realised but two patties is standard and the cheese literally oozes out between the meat in the most tempting way imaginable  the burgers are real juicy as well  be warned you ll need about 3 napkins to get through one of these beasts  sadly the actual eating part wasn t great  the meat is under seasoned  the hot sauce was fairly mild and watery for  10 50 i expected a lot better five guys seemed a great place in theory but sadly didn t quite live up to the hype    
736	5.0	I'd heard a lot of good things about this place recently so thought I'd best see what all the hype was about. I ordered the hamburger (with lots of free additional toppings such as grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, pickle, etc.), the spicy fries and a refillable soft drink. The burger was tasty and quite big but it wasn't really anything special. The fries were very good, nice and crispy but not too much, and you got a lot for your money - I had a the smallest option. The drink on the other hand was Amazing!!! They have a drinks machine with 100 different flavours! Firstly I tried Raspberry Diet Coke, then Fruit punch Fanta, Peach Sprite, followed by Peach Fanta to compare and topped it off with a take out of grape Fanta - definitely my fav of the ones I tried. The price was reasonable (roughly around £12.50 for burger, fries and a drink) and very central location. I would definitely recommend going here, my only tip would be to take small samples of the drinks then you can try them all without constantly going to the loo!!	i d heard a lot of good things about this place recently so thought i d best see what all the hype was about  i ordered the hamburger  with lots of free additional toppings such as grilled onions  grilled tomatoes  pickle  etc    the spicy fries and a refillable soft drink  the burger was tasty and quite big but it wasn t really anything special  the fries were very good  nice and crispy but not too much  and you got a lot for your money   i had a the smallest option  the drink on the other hand was amazing    they have a drinks machine with 100 different flavours  firstly i tried raspberry diet coke  then fruit punch fanta  peach sprite  followed by peach fanta to compare and topped it off with a take out of grape fanta   definitely my fav of the ones i tried  the price was reasonable  roughly around  12 50 for burger  fries and a drink  and very central location  i would definitely recommend going here  my only tip would be to take small samples of the drinks then you can try them all without constantly going to the loo  
737	2.0	If there's any reason for the long queue in front of this place most of the times I passed by, It could not be the food. I was so curious and joined that line of people to see what's special about this burger restaurant, and I must say that burgers here are not any more delicious than Burger King's. And the range of choices is disappointing, only 3 or 4 basic burgers (e.g. cheese, bacon and chesse) than  you get to select your toppings like cucumber, japalenos, mustard and stuff.Regarding the burger itself, it's just average quality for the price of £8, the amount for which I could get more than  a meal with fries and drinks in Burger King with same level of deliciousness.If you'd like some free peanuts and try out the super-wide-range-soft drink machine though, you can try this place	if there s any reason for the long queue in front of this place most of the times i passed by  it could not be the food  i was so curious and joined that line of people to see what s special about this burger restaurant  and i must say that burgers here are not any more delicious than burger king s  and the range of choices is disappointing  only 3 or 4 basic burgers  e g  cheese  bacon and chesse  than  you get to select your toppings like cucumber  japalenos  mustard and stuff regarding the burger itself  it s just average quality for the price of  8  the amount for which i could get more than  a meal with fries and drinks in burger king with same level of deliciousness if you d like some free peanuts and try out the super wide range soft drink machine though  you can try this place

741	2.0	Fun fast food diner concept with nice touches like the aforementioned unlimited peanuts, burger toppings and fizzy drinks. Perfectly good on that front. Just can't understand the great reviews for the food. Burgers were just downright mediocre. Everything was too salty.

742	3.0	My second visit was underwhelming. Whilst you can't deny the burgers are fresh, large, greasy and a satisfying guilty treat it just didn't hit the spot. Unfortunately I left feeling ill.I was also angered by the double queueing system which seemed to take an age. You have to queue to order and pay then you queue again to collect your food. At the time of my visit (4pm on a Sunday) this was neither efficient or enjoyable customer experience.	my second visit was underwhelming  whilst you can t deny the burgers are fresh  large  greasy and a satisfying guilty treat it just didn t hit the spot  unfortunately i left feeling ill i was also angered by the double queueing system which seemed to take an age  you have to queue to order and pay then you queue again to collect your food  at the time of my visit  4pm on a sunday  this was neither efficient or enjoyable customer experience 
743	5.0	I think by far this is the best place for a burger to have in London, ill keep the review short but the wait is alway long but the service is spectacular. The fries is always from a different farm so they are always different which is good. Price wise is ok, about a tenner for a burger and a drink. i don't usually order fries my sister does and we always share as they do give you an enormous amount of fries. Other than that 5 stars does suit them. Only thing maybe they could add cheese on the fries it would be nice.

744	4.0	I enjoy Five Guys burgers. Have I ever understood the crazy hype? Nope. A good burger at a good price and peanuts, too! Although I'm really annoyed (as an American) at the recent influx of American chains in the UK, at least the feeling of things at London's 1st Five Guys is the same as in the US. Even right down to the crazy Coke machine. My tip: split your party into part orderers, part go-get-a-seat-downstairsers. It will make your life so much easier.	i enjoy five guys burgers  have i ever understood the crazy hype  nope  a good burger at a good price and peanuts  too  although i m really annoyed  as an american  at the recent influx of american chains in the uk  at least the feeling of things at london s 1st five guys is the same as in the us  even right down to the crazy coke machine  my tip  split your party into part orderers  part go get a seat downstairsers  it will make your life so much easier 
745	3.0	"In a word: gluttonous. If ever the infamous ""super-size"" yet supposedly regular American size burger hit the UK dining experience it has taken the shape of a Five Guys burger.Forgetting to order a small burger I received the diner's standard of a double beef patty with my request of onions, lettuce, pickles and tomatoes all wrapped in a silver lining of foil and shoved in a grease-blotted brown paper bag. Luckily I was told that one portion of fries was enough for two, so me and my partner shared a bag heaped with cajun fries. The restaurant has a downstairs seating area which was really quiet so we headed straight down after noticing how busy it was on the ground floor. Dotted around the place are also huge bags of free monkey nuts so go mad. When it comes to drinks the diner has an impressive drinks dispenser that brags over 100 Coca-Cola beverages. We took advantage of this and made a few amateur mocktails (why not?) that worked like a sweet, sweet fizz to wash down our immense meal of meat and potatoes. Naturally my burger fell apart making it somewhat difficult to eat it in a more civilized manor but I guess I can't really complain. My meal was delicious, filling and oh so meaty. But I can't nudge the feeling that it may, in fact, be very, very bad for me in the long run if I were to make Five Guys a regular lunch/dinner choice. I would say it's definitely a one-off kinda deal (for me anyway)."	in a word  gluttonous  if ever the infamous  super size  yet supposedly regular american size burger hit the uk dining experience it has taken the shape of a five guys burger forgetting to order a small burger i received the diner s standard of a double beef patty with my request of onions  lettuce  pickles and tomatoes all wrapped in a silver lining of foil and shoved in a grease blotted brown paper bag  luckily i was told that one portion of fries was enough for two  so me and my partner shared a bag heaped with cajun fries  the restaurant has a downstairs seating area which was really quiet so we headed straight down after noticing how busy it was on the ground floor  dotted around the place are also huge bags of free monkey nuts so go mad  when it comes to drinks the diner has an impressive drinks dispenser that brags over 100 coca cola beverages  we took advantage of this and made a few amateur mocktails  why not   that worked like a sweet  sweet fizz to wash down our immense meal of meat and potatoes  naturally my burger fell apart making it somewhat difficult to eat it in a more civilized manor but i guess i can t really complain  my meal was delicious  filling and oh so meaty  but i can t nudge the feeling that it may  in fact  be very  very bad for me in the long run if i were to make five guys a regular lunch dinner choice  i would say it s definitely a one off kinda deal  for me anyway  
746	2.0	I've not visited Five Guys in the US, but have heard great things. When I heard they were opening on the same weekend as Shake Shack, it was hard to decide which to visit first. In the end, I went to both on the opening weekend.Sadly, Five Guys was very disappointing. I was expecting great things, but it just didn't deliver. The burgers were dry and bland, the fries far too greasy (although the portion sizes were generous). Service was very impersonal - at one point we were given the wrong order, and found it impossible to get the attention of any staff to hand it back and get it to the right person (you place your order, get a number and wait to be called - we misheard the number and no one else stepped forward).This could be excusable, because Five Guys is very much a fast food joint, if it weren't for the prices, which are comparable to places like Honest Burgers, Patty & Bun, Byron and Meat Liquor.I'll probably give them another go at some point - but only if I'm a hurry and can't face McDonalds.	i ve not visited five guys in the us  but have heard great things  when i heard they were opening on the same weekend as shake shack  it was hard to decide which to visit first  in the end  i went to both on the opening weekend sadly  five guys was very disappointing  i was expecting great things  but it just didn t deliver  the burgers were dry and bland  the fries far too greasy  although the portion sizes were generous   service was very impersonal   at one point we were given the wrong order  and found it impossible to get the attention of any staff to hand it back and get it to the right person  you place your order  get a number and wait to be called   we misheard the number and no one else stepped forward  this could be excusable  because five guys is very much a fast food joint  if it weren t for the prices  which are comparable to places like honest burgers  patty   bun  byron and meat liquor i ll probably give them another go at some point   but only if i m a hurry and can t face mcdonalds 
747	3.0	Five Guys have stuck to the limited selection of foods they offer in the States - you can have a burger or a hotdog with either plain or cajun spiced fries AND you can have as many toppings as you like for no extra charge. It's worth noting that a standard Five Guys burger comes with two patties and if you've a smaller appetite then you should probably go for the Little Burger instead. My order was missed and they had to submit it back in to the conveyor belt of a system before I could dig in but in the end I was very much underwhelmed with their offerings.	five guys have stuck to the limited selection of foods they offer in the states   you can have a burger or a hotdog with either plain or cajun spiced fries and you can have as many toppings as you like for no extra charge  it s worth noting that a standard five guys burger comes with two patties and if you ve a smaller appetite then you should probably go for the little burger instead  my order was missed and they had to submit it back in to the conveyor belt of a system before i could dig in but in the end i was very much underwhelmed with their offerings 
748	3.0	What I liked:Free refills for drinks and condiments (absolutely love how relaxed English people are with their free condiments), drink flavours available, quick service and the free peanuts.Possible improvements:Burger was only average. Did not find it outstanding in any way and was also quite expensive for the quality. Interior is very red and music was loud.. I think this is meant to get people in and out of the place as quickly as possible. Definitely worth experiencing, if only once.	what i liked free refills for drinks and condiments  absolutely love how relaxed english people are with their free condiments   drink flavours available  quick service and the free peanuts possible improvements burger was only average  did not find it outstanding in any way and was also quite expensive for the quality  interior is very red and music was loud   i think this is meant to get people in and out of the place as quickly as possible  definitely worth experiencing  if only once 
749	1.0	"Yes, I know that its really really easy to give an American burger chain a 1 star review. Yes, I also know that loads of people won't get further than seeing 1 star and start thinking yada yada yada. I've tried to be throughly honest and 5 Guys IS a 1 star establishment..... let me explain!5 Guys has a door person whom I suspect is there solely to help you negotiate the strategically placed sacks of potatoes placed on the floor well that or there scared they'll get sued if anyone trips over them. The Hard Rock Cafe has guitars on the wall... 5 Guys has spuds on the floor. It being a 3pm on a tuesday it was pretty dead so spent a few minutes pursuing the menu. As others have said or alluded to the prices are at the absolute top end of the price spectrum. That in itself isn't a problem but I did wonder how I was meant to take away a £5 (.... yes £5!!!) large portion of fries as I didn't have a wheelbarrow with me come to think of it I wasn't with 3 friends who'd have to help me get through £5 WORTH of fries!Anyway a Cheese burger, large fries and a regular coke was £15.50. Sorry people but I just wasn't going to spend that so decided on a hamburger. 2 slices of what appeared to be kraft singles (20 pence?) that constituted a cheese burger would add £1.25. I hate carbonated drinks so skipped that and seeing the fries sitting under a heat lamp didn't endear me to spending £2.75  on a ""small"" portion of them.The man that took my order "" 1 hamburger, please"" seemed really proud of the company USP that all topping are free!!!! A quick word to the 5 Guys US marketing team....5 Guys = ""As many FREE toppings as you want"" Translated for the UK = ""Your paying for them whether your having them or not!"" As I said it wasn't busy so I got to talk to my server and obviously the topic of price came up. The reason (as he told me) that 5 Guys is soo expensive compared to say McD's is that the dastardly Ronald McD uses frozen patties whereas 5 Guys only use non-frozen patties.  He also confirmed that some of the staff despite a cheese burger, large fries and a medium coke costing £15.50 were on MINIMUM WAGE i.e. they can't legally pay them any less.Anyway it was good to be able to pass the time chatting because this is most definitely NOT fast food. From ordering to the point I was handed my burger it took just over 11 minutes.... eeeek!!Right to the meat of the review how was the burger?In these eco-friendly days of swimming with dolphins and composting toilets I was surprised to find my burger was handed to me in a paper bag despite asking to eat in. I was even more surprised to find the actual burger wrapped in tin foil! On unwrapping I have to say its not a pretty burger. On picking it up a fair bit of the topping fell out (I had the ketchup and ""mayonnaise"" left out as I hate slop) I was also hugely surprised to find that the bun felt like ""wonder bread"" I was expecting something more bready for £6.75.First bite.... bun melted into nothingness followed by an ice cube cold slice of tomato then the hot burger meat. If I didn't know what I was eating I'd have said it was a Subway sandwich (at half the price!). I did pinch a bit of the meat off to taste it on its own but sorry 5 Guys although it was more juicy (fatty) than a McD's purely on taste? nothing in it.  The overwhelming feeling eating the burger was this conflict of ice cold salad items tomato, lettuce etc fighting with the super hot burger meat. Really unpleasant!My gut feeling is that anyone that uses lots of filling/ingredients is only doing it to hide general blandness. If 5 Guys thinks it has such a great quality product why is it treating it as a commodity? Would you serve a top quality cheese straight out of the fridge?I suspect that 5 Guys will find its UK offerings super profitable but its hard not to think that its customers and staff aren't being short changed.As I said a very definate 1 Star establishment"	yes  i know that its really really easy to give an american burger chain a 1 star review  yes  i also know that loads of people won t get further than seeing 1 star and start thinking yada yada yada  i ve tried to be throughly honest and 5 guys is a 1 star establishment      let me explain 5 guys has a door person whom i suspect is there solely to help you negotiate the strategically placed sacks of potatoes placed on the floor well that or there scared they ll get sued if anyone trips over them  the hard rock cafe has guitars on the wall    5 guys has spuds on the floor  it being a 3pm on a tuesday it was pretty dead so spent a few minutes pursuing the menu  as others have said or alluded to the prices are at the absolute top end of the price spectrum  that in itself isn t a problem but i did wonder how i was meant to take away a  5       yes  5     large portion of fries as i didn t have a wheelbarrow with me come to think of it i wasn t with 3 friends who d have to help me get through  5 worth of fries anyway a cheese burger  large fries and a regular coke was  15 50  sorry people but i just wasn t going to spend that so decided on a hamburger  2 slices of what appeared to be kraft singles  20 pence   that constituted a cheese burger would add  1 25  i hate carbonated drinks so skipped that and seeing the fries sitting under a heat lamp didn t endear me to spending  2 75  on a  small  portion of them the man that took my order   1 hamburger  please  seemed really proud of the company usp that all topping are free     a quick word to the 5 guys us marketing team    5 guys    as many free toppings as you want  translated for the uk    your paying for them whether your having them or not   as i said it wasn t busy so i got to talk to my server and obviously the topic of price came up  the reason  as he told me  that 5 guys is soo expensive compared to say mcd s is that the dastardly ronald mcd uses frozen patties whereas 5 guys only use non frozen patties   he also confirmed that some of the staff despite a cheese burger  large fries and a medium coke costing  15 50 were on minimum wage i e  they can t legally pay them any less anyway it was good to be able to pass the time chatting because this is most definitely not fast food  from ordering to the point i was handed my burger it took just over 11 minutes     eeeek  right to the meat of the review how was the burger in these eco friendly days of swimming with dolphins and composting toilets i was surprised to find my burger was handed to me in a paper bag despite asking to eat in  i was even more surprised to find the actual burger wrapped in tin foil  on unwrapping i have to say its not a pretty burger  on picking it up a fair bit of the topping fell out  i had the ketchup and  mayonnaise  left out as i hate slop  i was also hugely surprised to find that the bun felt like  wonder bread  i was expecting something more bready for  6 75 first bite     bun melted into nothingness followed by an ice cube cold slice of tomato then the hot burger meat  if i didn t know what i was eating i d have said it was a subway sandwich  at half the price    i did pinch a bit of the meat off to taste it on its own but sorry 5 guys although it was more juicy  fatty  than a mcd s purely on taste  nothing in it   the overwhelming feeling eating the burger was this conflict of ice cold salad items tomato  lettuce etc fighting with the super hot burger meat  really unpleasant my gut feeling is that anyone that uses lots of filling ingredients is only doing it to hide general blandness  if 5 guys thinks it has such a great quality product why is it treating it as a commodity  would you serve a top quality cheese straight out of the fridge i suspect that 5 guys will find its uk offerings super profitable but its hard not to think that its customers and staff aren t being short changed as i said a very definate 1 star establishment

Always busy, total tourist trap. One thing it has going for it is they sell beer. Always nice to flush down a burger meal with a Corona. If you really appreciate a decent burger, try somewhere else.	pretty gross  never crazy about it in the states and think the uk version is utterly rubbish  been to this one and the one in guildford  bland over priced burgers  hot dogs and fries  always busy  total tourist trap  one thing it has going for it is they sell beer  always nice to flush down a burger meal with a corona  if you really appreciate a decent burger  try somewhere else

If you sit in, you can get an 'all you can drink' cup and use the self-service drinks machine which has something like 100 flavour combinations of thinks like cherry coke, peach fanta, etc. Really good value and you can sit in with just a drink.	i got a take away burger and skin on chips  which were delicious  but greasy  the portions are huge  so go for less than you think you d want  if you sit in  you can get an  all you can drink  cup and use the self service drinks machine which has something like 100 flavour combinations of thinks like cherry coke  peach fanta  etc  really good value and you can sit in with just a drink

I thought 'no way am I about to spend £8 on a cheese burger and £2.75 on a small fries' I thought of mcdonalds and how a whole meal would cost me less than half this price. I ordered my burger (which btw comes with an array of toppings to choose from) and waited for my order. The staff here are cool and friendly, not like the disney robots at shake shack. I took my order downstairs where there was much more available seating and was happy to feel my take out bag felt heavy with tasty fat and calories. The fries were a 'small' portion but were much bigger than a large portion at mcdonalds. And my burger. Well, its safe to say I'm still thinking bout it now. I have been telling everyone I know to go, including all my twitter followers!!! Go go go go go if you can.	i d genuinely give this a million stars if i could  i came here and was so angry when i initally looked at the menu  i thought  no way am i about to spend  8 on a cheese burger and  2 75 on a small fries  i thought of mcdonalds and how a whole meal would cost me less than half this price  i ordered my burger  which btw comes with an array of toppings to choose from  and waited for my order  the staff here are cool and friendly  not like the disney robots at shake shack  i took my order downstairs where there was much more available seating and was happy to feel my take out bag felt heavy with tasty fat and calories  the fries were a  small  portion but were much bigger than a large portion at mcdonalds  and my burger  well  its safe to say i m still thinking bout it now  i have been telling everyone i know to go  including all my twitter followers    go go go go go if you can

Coming from CA, I really am missing In-n-Out and and thought perhaps this would be a great substitute. Boy, was I wrong! If this was a 2 pounds burger, then I would buy this out of convenience given that I live next door in Covent Garden. But heck no, 8 pounds for a crappy arse burger, no thanks. The patty was not fresh, buns were soggy and menu had too many choices (they weren't even fresh). It bothers me how they always have a massive line, I guess tourists do not know any better.	yeah  in n out copycat  you just do not cut it  i am sorry  your overpriced mediocre burgers and fries were not tasty  coming from ca  i really am missing in n out and and thought perhaps this would be a great substitute  boy  was i wrong  if this was a 2 pounds burger  then i would buy this out of convenience given that i live next door in covent garden  but heck no  8 pounds for a crappy arse burger  no thanks  the patty was not fresh  buns were soggy and menu had too many choices  they weren t even fresh   it bothers me how they always have a massive line  i guess tourists do not know any better

But since the burger renaissance we've been having in London this doesn't come close to the big hitters. Even though it gets a 3* its burger is no way as good as Meat Liquor which I have also given 3*. Its very quick to get served we waited 20 mins on a Saturday evening. I ordered the double cheese with pickles, onions, mushrooms and ketchup an order of fries and a coke. The burger comes in a traditional sesame bun which just doesn't cut it for me. The fries were soggy and needed binning (which I did) and the coke was too sweet as its from a dispenser. On the whole the burger was tasty and went down well with the minimum of queuing etc so I did return another day just for a burger. It was exactly as before so a good convenient burger bar if you're in that part of town.	five guys isn t a great burger place by a long shot  the burger is good  better than the chains and most of the traditional burger places in town  but since the burger renaissance we ve been having in london this doesn t come close to the big hitters  even though it gets a 3  its burger is no way as good as meat liquor which i have also given 3   its very quick to get served we waited 20 mins on a saturday evening  i ordered the double cheese with pickles  onions  mushrooms and ketchup an order of fries and a coke  the burger comes in a traditional sesame bun which just doesn t cut it for me  the fries were soggy and needed binning  which i did  and the coke was too sweet as its from a dispenser  on the whole the burger was tasty and went down well with the minimum of queuing etc so i did return another day just for a burger  it was exactly as before so a good convenient burger bar if you re in that part of town

We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
771	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep

It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame	have to say that i do like a good chinese and it s been awhile since i had one so whilst i m london we thought that we would take a look at chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price from the outside kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value   but word of warning they will take cash only so don t go in if you think you can pay by card  it did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn t sit there i tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn t work until the original person came back and moved us to another table  plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn t taste great but they were from a can  value for money wasn t really there which was a shame

775	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet!

778	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
779	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

782	4.0	This is a review for the little bakery, not the restaurant next door: Great little bakery, open late and serving a number of sweet and savoury treats!

We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
791	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep 
792	2.0	Have to say that I do like a good Chinese and it's been awhile since I had one so whilst I'm London we thought that we would take a look at Chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price.From the outside Kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value - but word of warning they will take cash only so don't go in if you think you can pay by card. It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame	have to say that i do like a good chinese and it s been awhile since i had one so whilst i m london we thought that we would take a look at chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price from the outside kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value   but word of warning they will take cash only so don t go in if you think you can pay by card  it did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn t sit there i tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn t work until the original person came back and moved us to another table  plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn t taste great but they were from a can  value for money wasn t really there which was a shame

If you leave food on your plate, you'd have to pay and I got the iced tea and they gave me a small amount. Once I finished the drink I asked for a free refill and they said, ""yeah sure,"" and when she gave me my refill she said, ""£3 for drink.""

795	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

796	4.0	Another one of the Restaurants in Chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go. I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

798	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
799	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

815	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table.

816	4.0	Another one of the Restaurants in Chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go. I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

818	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
819	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20. Cheap as chips!	i only go to the bakery for a quick pit stop  this place is always busy with people picking out sweet and savoury delights  but after seeing the munchies youtube channel and action bronson  rapper who also knows world food and can cook  state that this place has the best bbq pork bun   i had to go  i went  i bought two  and i loved it  as he also stated it s better warm but they don t really warm it up  and barely speak much english  but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go  and for  1 20  cheap as chips

Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay.

All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

830	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
831	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off.

839	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm 
840	4.0	I only go to the bakery for a quick pit stop. This place is always busy with people picking out sweet and savoury delights. But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20. Cheap as chips!	i only go to the bakery for a quick pit stop  this place is always busy with people picking out sweet and savoury delights  but after seeing the munchies youtube channel and action bronson  rapper who also knows world food and can cook  state that this place has the best bbq pork bun   i had to go  i went  i bought two  and i loved it  as he also stated it s better warm but they don t really warm it up  and barely speak much english  but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go  and for  1 20  cheap as chips

Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay. Once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy.	this is a review for the little bakery  not the restaurant next door  great little bakery  open late and serving a number of sweet and savoury treats  reasonably priced for individual little snacks  service is very fast paced and non smiley  you order what you want and it s boxed up straight away  then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay  once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy

The standard I use for judging bakeries in Chinatown is pretty simple- the roast pork bun. here, I found it well executed and fresh, as were other purchases, including a lurid but delicious Swiss roll.

848	5.0	Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

850	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
851	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep 
852	2.0	Have to say that I do like a good Chinese and it's been awhile since I had one so whilst I'm London we thought that we would take a look at Chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price.From the outside Kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value - but word of warning they will take cash only so don't go in if you think you can pay by card. It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can.

855	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare.

If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

868	5.0	Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

870	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
871	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep 
872	2.0	Have to say that I do like a good Chinese and it's been awhile since I had one so whilst I'm London we thought that we would take a look at Chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price.From the outside Kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value - but word of warning they will take cash only so don't go in if you think you can pay by card. It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame	have to say that i do like a good chinese and it s been awhile since i had one so whilst i m london we thought that we would take a look at chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price from the outside kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value   but word of warning they will take cash only so don t go in if you think you can pay by card  it did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn t sit there i tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn t work until the original person came back and moved us to another table  plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn t taste great but they were from a can  value for money wasn t really there which was a shame

If you leave food on your plate, you'd have to pay and I got the iced tea and they gave me a small amount. Once I finished the drink I asked for a free refill and they said, ""yeah sure,"" and when she gave me my refill she said, ""£3 for drink.""

875	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

890	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
891	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep

It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can.

If you leave food on your plate, you'd have to pay and I got the iced tea and they gave me a small amount. Once I finished the drink I asked for a free refill and they said, ""yeah sure,"" and when she gave me my refill she said, ""£3 for drink.""

895	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

896	4.0	Another one of the Restaurants in Chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go. I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

898	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
899	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay.

915	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news!

The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes.

918	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
919	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay.

928	5.0	Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

930	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
931	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay. Once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy.	this is a review for the little bakery  not the restaurant next door  great little bakery  open late and serving a number of sweet and savoury treats  reasonably priced for individual little snacks  service is very fast paced and non smiley  you order what you want and it s boxed up straight away  then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay  once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy

The standard I use for judging bakeries in Chinatown is pretty simple- the roast pork bun. here, I found it well executed and fresh, as were other purchases, including a lurid but delicious Swiss roll. Prices are pretty similar to the local competition £1-£2 per item.	one of the better bakeries in chinatown  brisk  efficient staff   one lot who take and box your purchases  before handing an invoice to the person at the cash desk    the standard i use for judging bakeries in chinatown is pretty simple  the roast pork bun  here  i found it well executed and fresh  as were other purchases  including a lurid but delicious swiss roll  prices are pretty similar to the local competition  1  2 per item

948	5.0	Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

950	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
951	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep 
952	2.0	Have to say that I do like a good Chinese and it's been awhile since I had one so whilst I'm London we thought that we would take a look at Chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price.From the outside Kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value - but word of warning they will take cash only so don't go in if you think you can pay by card. It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame	have to say that i do like a good chinese and it s been awhile since i had one so whilst i m london we thought that we would take a look at chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price from the outside kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value   but word of warning they will take cash only so don t go in if you think you can pay by card  it did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn t sit there i tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn t work until the original person came back and moved us to another table  plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn t taste great but they were from a can  value for money wasn t really there which was a shame

955	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

970	4.0	BAKERY Review Only:This is the most authentic Chinese bakery in London. We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.	bakery review only this is the most authentic chinese bakery in london  we enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in trafalgar square egg tarts   yes  good crust that doesn t collapse on the first bite  center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality sesame seed balls   there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5 10 min for the next batch  for those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean  this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn t overwhelm the entire ball bbq pork bun   large portion  we got lucky that it was still pretty warm 
971	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep

It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame	have to say that i do like a good chinese and it s been awhile since i had one so whilst i m london we thought that we would take a look at chinatown and pick a place that looked good from the food on offer and had a reasonable price from the outside kowloon looked like the place to go as the food through the window looked very appetising and good value   but word of warning they will take cash only so don t go in if you think you can pay by card  it did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn t sit there i tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn t work until the original person came back and moved us to another table  plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn t taste great but they were from a can  value for money wasn t really there which was a shame

If you leave food on your plate, you'd have to pay and I got the iced tea and they gave me a small amount. Once I finished the drink I asked for a free refill and they said, ""yeah sure,"" and when she gave me my refill she said, ""£3 for drink.""

975	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

978	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
979	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

991	1.0	The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.	the first 1 star review i ve ever given and i am extremely saddened    first of all  the food  there was a great selection  as someone who grew up with asian baked goods  the selection got me and my sister very excited  and the food looked fresh enough  but when we saw the reviews  instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted  we decided to just try one  thank goodness we did that  because we purchased 1 pineapple bun and    it was terrible  terrible in the way that it tasted stale  and it was salty  i couldn t figure out why because pineapple buns are supposed to taste sweet  i took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away  it wasn t even worth trying to finish it  second of all  the service  now  like i said  i grew up on asian baked goods so i have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness  but man  was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level  my mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid  when we went to pay  the lady just took the money  no thank you  no come again  well  we won t be coming again anymore  this entire place was a disappointment  i don t really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would ve just put me off  extremely disappointed  and it s establishments like these that give some asian restaurants a bad rep

995	1.0	Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

996	4.0	Another one of the Restaurants in Chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go. I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

998	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
999	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm

But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20.

All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was £14 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (£2 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares.

1016	4.0	Another one of the Restaurants in Chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go. I selected a duck pastry (wasn't sure what it was and took a risk) and got a red bean mochi !  The mochi was delicious! So delicious I wanted to go back and get more!  The duck pastry was interesting to say the least. I started with the duck pastry and ate only half. It had interesting flavours, like a sweet bean/ peanut paste? And then some fermented duck egg? That was my guess at least . It was a gamble but I'm still glad I tried it! The mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet! I love red bean mochi.	another one of the restaurants in chinatown that has a bakery front so you can just buy and go  i selected a duck pastry  wasn t sure what it was and took a risk  and got a red bean mochi    the mochi was delicious  so delicious i wanted to go back and get more   the duck pastry was interesting to say the least  i started with the duck pastry and ate only half  it had interesting flavours  like a sweet bean  peanut paste  and then some fermented duck egg  that was my guess at least   it was a gamble but i m still glad i tried it  the mochi was good to end on since it was so yummy and sweet  i love red bean mochi

1018	2.0	It used to be the best Chinese bakery in Chinatown but I'm afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months. What used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust. Along with the egg tarts, I bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers, banana mochi, melon cake and sesame ball. Melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale. Would not go back again - the search for a decent Chinese bakery continues...	it used to be the best chinese bakery in chinatown but i m afraid their standards have dropped in the last couple months  what used to be fresh egg tarts with the fragrant egg middle and buttery flaky crust is now replaced with a diluted egg filling and a really sad crust  along with the egg tarts  i bought my usual share of beef curry turnovers  banana mochi  melon cake and sesame ball  melon cake was okay but the rest tasted stale  would not go back again   the search for a decent chinese bakery continues   
1019	5.0	Ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of Hong Kong last year, I've had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot. If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At £1 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.	ever since my first egg custard tart in the foodie wonderland of hong kong last year  i ve had a hankering to find one closer to home that hits the same spot  if i hadn t had that specific treat in mind i d have been in big trouble  as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft i felt like more of a giant in there than usual  the tricky part is figuring out the non obvious serving  system  which kinda adds to the experience  basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free  as you won t be beckoned in  point out what you want  literally  and they ll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash only till  pick up your box  enjoy ok i confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst i was looking around drooling  there s huge choice  both savoury and sweet  and all looks enticingly fresh  not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week   also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away  at  1 a pop the mark up on the custard tarts versus hk is noticeable but hey inevitable  and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings  firm pastry  light custard  not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble  so i ll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more  for now though i still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home    mmm 
1020	4.0	I only go to the bakery for a quick pit stop. This place is always busy with people picking out sweet and savoury delights. But after seeing the Munchies Youtube Channel and Action Bronson (rapper who also knows world food and can cook) state that this place has THE best BBQ Pork bun...I had to go. I went, I bought two, and I loved it. As he also stated it's better warm but they don't really warm it up. And barely speak much English, but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go. And for £1.20. Cheap as chips!	i only go to the bakery for a quick pit stop  this place is always busy with people picking out sweet and savoury delights  but after seeing the munchies youtube channel and action bronson  rapper who also knows world food and can cook  state that this place has the best bbq pork bun   i had to go  i went  i bought two  and i loved it  as he also stated it s better warm but they don t really warm it up  and barely speak much english  but loved it all the same as a cheap snack on the go  and for  1 20  cheap as chips

1022	4.0	This is a review for the little bakery, not the restaurant next door: Great little bakery, open late and serving a number of sweet and savoury treats! Reasonably priced for individual little snacks. Service is very fast paced and non-smiley: you order what you want and it's boxed up straight away. Then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay. Once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy.	this is a review for the little bakery  not the restaurant next door  great little bakery  open late and serving a number of sweet and savoury treats  reasonably priced for individual little snacks  service is very fast paced and non smiley  you order what you want and it s boxed up straight away  then you leave your box while you go to the till and pay  once you have your receipt you can pick up your package and enjoy

1024	4.0	One of the better Bakeries in Chinatown- brisk, efficient staff ( one lot who take and box your purchases, before handing an invoice to the person at the cash desk) . The standard I use for judging bakeries in Chinatown is pretty simple- the roast pork bun. here, I found it well executed and fresh, as were other purchases, including a lurid but delicious Swiss roll. Prices are pretty similar to the local competition £1-£2 per item.	one of the better bakeries in chinatown  brisk  efficient staff   one lot who take and box your purchases  before handing an invoice to the person at the cash desk    the standard i use for judging bakeries in chinatown is pretty simple  the roast pork bun  here  i found it well executed and fresh  as were other purchases  including a lurid but delicious swiss roll  prices are pretty similar to the local competition  1  2 per item

1028	5.0	Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.	quick glance   two varieties of egg tart  staff handles baked goodsfull review after visiting half a dozen bakeries in chinatown  i found it here at kowloon   egg tart with short crust base  all the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety  some looking sadder than others  but i ve always been a fan of the short crust base  imagine my delight when i finally found it here at kowloon  and they look perfectly formed  not to mention oh so tasty  the other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic

1031	4.0	I was proper pleased with Cubana. We ventured out for a work lunch and it was nice to see multiple veggie options on the lunch menu. I even had trouble deciding! Crikey!!! Is that even how you spell it?I chose the Quimbombo because it was fun to say but also an okra casserole sounded interesting. The flavours were very nice and I was happy with how nomtastic it tasted with the rice and plantains. They also have this crazy bright orange chili sauce which is delicious. £7 for an entree and £10 for an entree and starter. I had the sweet potato falafel as a starter which was also yummy. Not bad Cubana I'll come back to try your massive pitchers that everyone drinks after work.	i was proper pleased with cubana  we ventured out for a work lunch and it was nice to see multiple veggie options on the lunch menu  i even had trouble deciding  crikey    is that even how you spell it i chose the quimbombo because it was fun to say but also an okra casserole sounded interesting  the flavours were very nice and i was happy with how nomtastic it tasted with the rice and plantains  they also have this crazy bright orange chili sauce which is delicious   7 for an entree and  10 for an entree and starter  i had the sweet potato falafel as a starter which was also yummy  not bad cubana i ll come back to try your massive pitchers that everyone drinks after work 
1032	2.0	To all of the people giving this place a good review - are you okay?! I've actually never had cuban food this bad. Like ever. I was so hopeful and ready for some delicious cuban eats but I was greeted with less than mediocre food and a strange ambiance. The yuka fries were dry, the falafel shouldn't even be on the menu and don't even get me STARTED about the salsa and plantain chips. I've had better food served to me out of the back of a sketchy van parked next to the beach which ended up giving me food poisoning. At least it tasted good! The staff was incompetent and slow (We waited so long for our food). The only reasons I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is: a. I had a nice time due to the copious amounts of tequila b. I didn't end up with food poisoning (but it was a close call). It's safe to say I won't be back and to be honest, I am very disappointed with the online community for leading me to this place. This is NOT good cuban food and I could honestly make better food myself. To the people who thought this place had good food- please contact me and I will show you what actual good food tastes like. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time and money.	to all of the people giving this place a good review   are you okay   i ve actually never had cuban food this bad  like ever  i was so hopeful and ready for some delicious cuban eats but i was greeted with less than mediocre food and a strange ambiance  the yuka fries were dry  the falafel shouldn t even be on the menu and don t even get me started about the salsa and plantain chips  i ve had better food served to me out of the back of a sketchy van parked next to the beach which ended up giving me food poisoning  at least it tasted good  the staff was incompetent and slow  we waited so long for our food   the only reasons i gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is  a  i had a nice time due to the copious amounts of tequila b  i didn t end up with food poisoning  but it was a close call   it s safe to say i won t be back and to be honest  i am very disappointed with the online community for leading me to this place  this is not good cuban food and i could honestly make better food myself  to the people who thought this place had good food  please contact me and i will show you what actual good food tastes like  do yourself a favour and don t waste your time and money 
1033	4.0	Ugh, everything here was so good that I struggled not to go back, as I wanted to try as many different restaurants in London as possible. I just love Cuban food, in general (see my previous reviews) so it wasn't too hard to find this place simply delicious! I had the slow roasted pork plate with rice, black beans, and fried plantains. I'm salivating right now just reminiscing on it. Also had the piña colada, which was perfect! Not too sweet and decently strong! The only reason I knocked a star off is due to the long periods of waiting to have our order taken, receive our drinks/food, and receive our bill. They clearly were very understaffed with servers, so that dampened the experience a bit. Otherwise, you can't beat the atmosphere, good vibes, and music there!	ugh  everything here was so good that i struggled not to go back  as i wanted to try as many different restaurants in london as possible  i just love cuban food  in general  see my previous reviews  so it wasn t too hard to find this place simply delicious  i had the slow roasted pork plate with rice  black beans  and fried plantains  i m salivating right now just reminiscing on it  also had the pi a colada  which was perfect  not too sweet and decently strong  the only reason i knocked a star off is due to the long periods of waiting to have our order taken  receive our drinks food  and receive our bill  they clearly were very understaffed with servers  so that dampened the experience a bit  otherwise  you can t beat the atmosphere  good vibes  and music there

1036	5.0	When the restaurant you mean to go to is flooded Yelp can be such a life saver. This place was incredible. First off for the easy access to Waterloo it is very well priced. I didn't get the name of every wonderful staff member I interacted with, but from the bar tender who served us our happy hour jugs to our main waiter Juando who made sure we were well taken care of (and didn't laugh at our broken Spanish). The food is really delicious and well done. The drinks were incredible, they aren't so expensive and are very well made (and strong).This is a great happy hour joint, so grab the two for one jugs and laugh at the drunk 18 year olds. Grabbing food after is a great treat. Look forward to coming back to this gem.	when the restaurant you mean to go to is flooded yelp can be such a life saver  this place was incredible  first off for the easy access to waterloo it is very well priced  i didn t get the name of every wonderful staff member i interacted with  but from the bar tender who served us our happy hour jugs to our main waiter juando who made sure we were well taken care of  and didn t laugh at our broken spanish   the food is really delicious and well done  the drinks were incredible  they aren t so expensive and are very well made  and strong  this is a great happy hour joint  so grab the two for one jugs and laugh at the drunk 18 year olds  grabbing food after is a great treat  look forward to coming back to this gem

1044	3.0	In the area for Alice's Adventures Underground at Waterloo Vaults, we were looking for a quick drink to pass some time. It being a sunny Friday in the early evening, Cubana was absolutely heaving outside! Needless to say, we couldn't get a seat on the 'terrace' area, so headed inside to the bar and to scope out a seat. Unfortunately the majority of seating was reserved for eating, but someone directed us to a small drinking area behind the bar. This was not unlike sitting in someone's living room, with a few leather couches and posters dotted around the walls. We both had a margarita, quickly shaken up by the bartender, and at £6.50 for two (hello, happy hour!) this isn't to be sniffed at - especially when considering usual London prices! The drinks were tasty, with a real sour kick, balanced out with the salt rim.We had to leave due to heading to the theatre and, although considering popping back in on the way to the tube, it was even busier. Good to know about if you're in the area, but wouldn't make it a sole destination.	in the area for alice s adventures underground at waterloo vaults  we were looking for a quick drink to pass some time  it being a sunny friday in the early evening  cubana was absolutely heaving outside  needless to say  we couldn t get a seat on the  terrace  area  so headed inside to the bar and to scope out a seat  unfortunately the majority of seating was reserved for eating  but someone directed us to a small drinking area behind the bar  this was not unlike sitting in someone s living room  with a few leather couches and posters dotted around the walls  we both had a margarita  quickly shaken up by the bartender  and at  6 50 for two  hello  happy hour   this isn t to be sniffed at   especially when considering usual london prices  the drinks were tasty  with a real sour kick  balanced out with the salt rim we had to leave due to heading to the theatre and  although considering popping back in on the way to the tube  it was even busier  good to know about if you re in the area  but wouldn t make it a sole destination 
1045	4.0	I really liked my experience at the Cubana. It's a very colorful place, and you got to love the rifles on the wall (well, this is Cuba isn't it). From the outside, you can spot Cubana from afar considering the thought they put in their decoration. It's lovely, it's colorful, and it makes you want to come inside. I've been wanting to try it out for a while considering I live nearby and walk up to Waterloo station all the time but it's often very busy. Not surprising that it's so busy when you see their happy hour offer on the cocktails (2 for one) and their dishes. I guess it's classic Cuban food, not that I know anything about it, and it was good.Service was helpful and fast.And they had live music !	i really liked my experience at the cubana  it s a very colorful place  and you got to love the rifles on the wall  well  this is cuba isn t it   from the outside  you can spot cubana from afar considering the thought they put in their decoration  it s lovely  it s colorful  and it makes you want to come inside  i ve been wanting to try it out for a while considering i live nearby and walk up to waterloo station all the time but it s often very busy  not surprising that it s so busy when you see their happy hour offer on the cocktails  2 for one  and their dishes  i guess it s classic cuban food  not that i know anything about it  and it was good service was helpful and fast and they had live music

1047	4.0	We met friends at South Bank Centre for some hot cocoa with marshmallows (us girls) and beer (the boozy boys!). We hadn't zeroed in on a restaurant and our friend P suggested going to Cubana. So we walked there and reached after I took a million photos of the wall graffiti en route. In the dead of winter, Cubana brought in so much warmth!! We struggled to get a table. But the boys worked their charm and got us seated.Between the four of us, I think we tried everything on the cocktail list! I loved my caiprinhas. Food is good...but frankly, I wouldn't give it much importance. The music and ambiance were my priority.They open the dance floor after 10. Beautiful music and mood. The atmosphere takes over everything....all else will seem fantastic automatically. Would love to go here again and again and again...anytime I am in the vicinity...actually, only if it's evening.	we met friends at south bank centre for some hot cocoa with marshmallows  us girls  and beer  the boozy boys    we hadn t zeroed in on a restaurant and our friend p suggested going to cubana  so we walked there and reached after i took a million photos of the wall graffiti en route  in the dead of winter  cubana brought in so much warmth   we struggled to get a table  but the boys worked their charm and got us seated between the four of us  i think we tried everything on the cocktail list  i loved my caiprinhas  food is good   but frankly  i wouldn t give it much importance  the music and ambiance were my priority they open the dance floor after 10  beautiful music and mood  the atmosphere takes over everything    all else will seem fantastic automatically  would love to go here again and again and again   anytime i am in the vicinity   actually  only if it s evening

1050	3.0	Nice place to go for drinks. They definitely know how to make good cocktails in Cubana. I had a fresh frozen smoothie of ripe guava blended with tropical fruit and juices, which tasted quite refreshing.It gets busy in the evenings, we went on a Sunday evening and almost all the tables were taken. If you are planning to go for food, better book a table in advance.I was pleased with lively music and colorful decor, portraits of Che, rifles and revolutionary flags hanging on the walls. The service was good too. Easy reach from Waterloo station, within 5 min walking.There is a nice lounge terrace area outside, which would be good to sit at during the warmer evenings in the summer.	nice place to go for drinks  they definitely know how to make good cocktails in cubana  i had a fresh frozen smoothie of ripe guava blended with tropical fruit and juices  which tasted quite refreshing it gets busy in the evenings  we went on a sunday evening and almost all the tables were taken  if you are planning to go for food  better book a table in advance i was pleased with lively music and colorful decor  portraits of che  rifles and revolutionary flags hanging on the walls  the service was good too  easy reach from waterloo station  within 5 min walking there is a nice lounge terrace area outside  which would be good to sit at during the warmer evenings in the summer 
1051	3.0	A bit crazy and touristy but fun with decent good. Go there fore the drinks, the crowd and the fun vibe. It gets REALLY crowded. Eating there can be challenging. We've been there three times and only able to get a table once! That time we got chased out to make room for the next reservation. If you love Cuban food and drink like I do it's definitely worth the trip. Just wave a back up plan for dinner.	a bit crazy and touristy but fun with decent good  go there fore the drinks  the crowd and the fun vibe  it gets really crowded  eating there can be challenging  we ve been there three times and only able to get a table once  that time we got chased out to make room for the next reservation  if you love cuban food and drink like i do it s definitely worth the trip  just wave a back up plan for dinner

1054	3.0	"We were looking forward to a fun night of dinner and live Latin American music. We got it, but it wasn't quite what we were hoping for. We made the latest possible dinner reservation, 9:30, hoping we would be well positioned to have a table to chill at once the live music started up. Unfortunately, we were only hurried through our meal faster, as they stack up all the tables and chairs to transition to club mode. That's right, once it is club time, don't expect to sit down for the rest of the night. There are not even any barstools, which is ridiculous when you consider people are dancing and might want to sit and rest a quick minute. Anyway, the food. I had the ropa vieja, which was a little bland. My wife had the slow-roasted pork and loved it. We ordered within minutes of sitting and had our food possibly less than 5, but not more than 10 minutes later. Service so fast it feels like the food has been sitting around all day waiting to be ordered. Uncomfortably fast. I didn't feel as though my meal was cooked for me in response to my order. The server was friendly, but the speed of the service prohibited enjoyment of the restaurant. And that's coming from an American, where you know we love our food fast! Perhaps my wife and I have grown to appreciate the European-style restaurant experience during our two years living in England, but I think it was a bit impersonal even by American standards. Then there was the ""live music."" It was live in that there were people being paid to be there, but it was more like glorified karaoke. A woman in control of an iPad would select a song, and then her counterparts with bongos would beat along with the background music and sing. I was hoping for a Latin salsa band, but instead we got a chick with an iPad. Still, the experience was a fun night out, so I can't knock it too much, I'm just not sure we will go back."	we were looking forward to a fun night of dinner and live latin american music  we got it  but it wasn t quite what we were hoping for  we made the latest possible dinner reservation  9 30  hoping we would be well positioned to have a table to chill at once the live music started up  unfortunately  we were only hurried through our meal faster  as they stack up all the tables and chairs to transition to club mode  that s right  once it is club time  don t expect to sit down for the rest of the night  there are not even any barstools  which is ridiculous when you consider people are dancing and might want to sit and rest a quick minute  anyway  the food  i had the ropa vieja  which was a little bland  my wife had the slow roasted pork and loved it  we ordered within minutes of sitting and had our food possibly less than 5  but not more than 10 minutes later  service so fast it feels like the food has been sitting around all day waiting to be ordered  uncomfortably fast  i didn t feel as though my meal was cooked for me in response to my order  the server was friendly  but the speed of the service prohibited enjoyment of the restaurant  and that s coming from an american  where you know we love our food fast  perhaps my wife and i have grown to appreciate the european style restaurant experience during our two years living in england  but i think it was a bit impersonal even by american standards  then there was the  live music   it was live in that there were people being paid to be there  but it was more like glorified karaoke  a woman in control of an ipad would select a song  and then her counterparts with bongos would beat along with the background music and sing  i was hoping for a latin salsa band  but instead we got a chick with an ipad  still  the experience was a fun night out  so i can t knock it too much  i m just not sure we will go back 
1055	4.0	From the first view of the outside of the restaurant you know that it's a party sort of place. Known for its dance party in the evenings, it's also a place to go for the happy hour buzz. Select cocktails are around £6 a glass or £17 a jug which is a good deal. They weren't top notch but they tasted lovely.We began with a starter platter. The sweet potato and chorizo croquettes were definitely the best of the trio. I had the slow roasted pork as my main. This was very good. The plantains were particularly done well.We didn't stay for the dancing but the vibe seems really fabulous.  I'll have to try it in the future.	from the first view of the outside of the restaurant you know that it s a party sort of place  known for its dance party in the evenings  it s also a place to go for the happy hour buzz  select cocktails are around  6 a glass or  17 a jug which is a good deal  they weren t top notch but they tasted lovely we began with a starter platter  the sweet potato and chorizo croquettes were definitely the best of the trio  i had the slow roasted pork as my main  this was very good  the plantains were particularly done well we didn t stay for the dancing but the vibe seems really fabulous   i ll have to try it in the future

Meeting a friend by Waterloo she had never been here so what a great opportunity so close to the station.We only had cocktails here, but if you came at 6ish when we did you could definitely score a table for food. And the menu looked pretty good at a glance. Fusion of the Latina vibe with some Cuban influence (apparently). I reserve the right to review this when I actually do eat here.We knew we were onto a good thing when we turned up to happy hour (5pm - 7pm) and with free tables for bar drinkers only. We grabbed a cheeky table down some steps amidst the vibrant coloured walls and stocked up on cocktails before the deal ran out. Mojitos, not good. Strawberry daiquiri, much better. The problem is how can you really complain at 2 for £6??However after the deals were over we treated ourselves to full price caipirinha (£6.50) and this was WELL worth the money! Now this is my favourite cocktail so if I approve it is worth approving ;) great texture in the muddled sugar and good flavour balance.

1058	2.0	Meh.  Unfortunately, we were seated for dinner right next to the bar during happy hour.  It was teeming with people standing in line to get their 2-for-1 tropical drinks.  The bar was ridiculously loud - not just from all of the people waiting and talking (which we would expect during that time) but from bartenders throwing empty bottles into trash cans causing everyone at our table to jump from being startled by the loud noise.  To add insult to injury, we sat watching the activity at the bar without a drink for 20 minutes because our drinks were taken to the wrong table. The food and mojitos were fine but not fantastic.	meh   unfortunately  we were seated for dinner right next to the bar during happy hour   it was teeming with people standing in line to get their 2 for 1 tropical drinks   the bar was ridiculously loud   not just from all of the people waiting and talking  which we would expect during that time  but from bartenders throwing empty bottles into trash cans causing everyone at our table to jump from being startled by the loud noise   to add insult to injury  we sat watching the activity at the bar without a drink for 20 minutes because our drinks were taken to the wrong table  the food and mojitos were fine but not fantastic

1060	2.0	"Cubana is maybe not the most polished of restaurants, but what it lacks in refinement it certainly makes up for in character. PROSThe food is authentic & deliciously packed with flavour. It's also a bonus that it's also relatively healthy for those of us who are trying to keep control of our waistline. Less healthy but no less enjoyable are the cocktails - and you'll struggle to find a fun, lively but relaxed place to sip the night away in central London. They also do some really fresh smoothies & non-alcoholic cocktails. It's located just a 5 minute walk away from Waterloo station (15 mins if you've had a few too many cocktails) & is well priced with the typical bill for drinks, starters & mains landing in the £60-70 range per couple. CONSIt can be busy, particularly during the week during & just after their happy hour (5pm-7pm)Side dishes are usually served with your starters (?) so make sure you clearly say which meal you want your sides with.For a place that claims to be the ""home of the mojito"" they are inconsistent & occasionally lacking in sufficient rum. The customer is not always right, hence the 2-stars. Twice now we have ordered & been billed for one thing but received something else. On the latest occasion the waitress insisted that our plate of fried plantain was in fact rice, chilli with plantain (despite there not being any rice or chilli anywhere in sight). Presuming your customers are stupid is never the right choice & is a great shame as it really detracts from what is otherwise a fantastic place in the city."	cubana is maybe not the most polished of restaurants  but what it lacks in refinement it certainly makes up for in character  prosthe food is authentic   deliciously packed with flavour  it s also a bonus that it s also relatively healthy for those of us who are trying to keep control of our waistline  less healthy but no less enjoyable are the cocktails   and you ll struggle to find a fun  lively but relaxed place to sip the night away in central london  they also do some really fresh smoothies   non alcoholic cocktails  it s located just a 5 minute walk away from waterloo station  15 mins if you ve had a few too many cocktails    is well priced with the typical bill for drinks  starters   mains landing in the  60 70 range per couple  consit can be busy  particularly during the week during   just after their happy hour  5pm 7pm side dishes are usually served with your starters     so make sure you clearly say which meal you want your sides with for a place that claims to be the  home of the mojito  they are inconsistent   occasionally lacking in sufficient rum  the customer is not always right  hence the 2 stars  twice now we have ordered   been billed for one thing but received something else  on the latest occasion the waitress insisted that our plate of fried plantain was in fact rice  chilli with plantain  despite there not being any rice or chilli anywhere in sight   presuming your customers are stupid is never the right choice   is a great shame as it really detracts from what is otherwise a fantastic place in the city

1065	4.0	Cubana is a mixture of a bar and restaurant I think it succeeds on both ends. The cocktail menu is quite extensive and all of them are a good deal through the happy hour. I do get happy when I drink cocktails, I don't know why :)I loved the Ensalada Fresca - that's a vegetarian salad and comes as a starter but don't fill up on it as it is quite big and you wouldn't get to try the goodness that comes later. They also have all sorts of deals through lunchtime. That being said and topped with the high quality of the food itself adds up for a brilliant choice for a lunch spot. If you're in the area you should definitely try it, despite the lack of imagination regarding the design of Cubana - it seems quite unwelcoming to me.	cubana is a mixture of a bar and restaurant i think it succeeds on both ends  the cocktail menu is quite extensive and all of them are a good deal through the happy hour  i do get happy when i drink cocktails  i don t know why   i loved the ensalada fresca   that s a vegetarian salad and comes as a starter but don t fill up on it as it is quite big and you wouldn t get to try the goodness that comes later  they also have all sorts of deals through lunchtime  that being said and topped with the high quality of the food itself adds up for a brilliant choice for a lunch spot  if you re in the area you should definitely try it  despite the lack of imagination regarding the design of cubana   it seems quite unwelcoming to me 
1066	3.0	Cubana's location close to the Old Vic theatre and happy hour from 5 to 7 everyday makes it a perfect location to grab some drinks right before a show.The drinks are strong! The pitchers are a bargain during happy hour. I've had a couple of different margaritas here, and they're on the sour side without being too sugary, just how I like it.I've never tried the food here though, mostly because their kitchen seems to be open during odd hours. We came once at around 7PM on a Sunday and were told that we couldn't order any hot food because the kitchen was closed. Then two minutes later we saw a waitress bringing a nachos plate out... odd.I'll probably come back because of the convenient location, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat or drink here.	cubana s location close to the old vic theatre and happy hour from 5 to 7 everyday makes it a perfect location to grab some drinks right before a show the drinks are strong  the pitchers are a bargain during happy hour  i ve had a couple of different margaritas here  and they re on the sour side without being too sugary  just how i like it i ve never tried the food here though  mostly because their kitchen seems to be open during odd hours  we came once at around 7pm on a sunday and were told that we couldn t order any hot food because the kitchen was closed  then two minutes later we saw a waitress bringing a nachos plate out    odd i ll probably come back because of the convenient location  but i wouldn t go out of my way to eat or drink here

They told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food, but our food didn't come for an hour and a half! If they didn't have a great happy hour, I would have been angry!

They refused to seat us when we arrived 20 minutes late although we called and were told that the table would wait for us.Twice the service wasn't good. I am not blaming it on the waitresses, they clearly have a lot on their plate.The second time I was even charged for something we did not order.Having said that, I must admit the food is pretty good. I mean, let's be honest, there are no plenty of choices in Cuba, so you can't expect that here. The ropa vieja is simply the best dish they serve. Really good, great portions and filling. The prawns are also one of my favourites as so are the croquettes. I even ordered the vegetarian plate and was ok although a bit dry.The drinks are really good. I would say I had the best mojitos outside Cuba, but they are a bit overpriced. Not too bad considering they are freshly made :)After eleven you can move your body with the latin music, which is really nice.Don't expect a lot from the service, have some patience and enjoy the music and the atmosphere.

1070	4.0	We just happened to stop by because we love Cuban sandwiches. We sat down and they said they only serve them from opening to 1400. Wtf?! That's absurd but we still ate there. I don't remember what we got but we shared a typical Cuban dish, pork, rice , black bean and plantain dish. Very very very good. Prolly one of the best we ever had in London. All the restaurants in London are not authentic.	we just happened to stop by because we love cuban sandwiches  we sat down and they said they only serve them from opening to 1400  wtf   that s absurd but we still ate there  i don t remember what we got but we shared a typical cuban dish  pork  rice   black bean and plantain dish  very very very good  prolly one of the best we ever had in london  all the restaurants in london are not authentic

As the name suggests, it's a Cuban themed bar and they do it well. On most nights, you can expect a lively atmosphere, some colourful decorations, and mojitos galore. But what really gets it going are the live acts on the weekends! The last time I was there, the band was composed of three middle aged guys that looked as if they had just strolled in off the streets of Havana. They were exceptional musicians and had the whole place dancing up a storm in short order. Unlike Floridita, where it seems that everyone is a professional salsa dancer, Cubana attracts the more amateur crowd and you can muddle your way through the basic steps without feeling too awkward. And after a few of the £17 mojito pitchers, it's unlikely that you'll give a damn and just go for it! They also have some crazy bright green drink (something Alligator) which looks ridiculous, tastes delicious, and has enough of a punch to floor an elephant.The minor gripe I have is the lack of dancing space given the various rooms and levels the bar is divided into. You can make do, but you're constantly dancing around the stream of people trying to make it to the bathroom or the bar. Still, given the fairly cheap drinks prices, the excellent music, and the great location next to Waterloo station, it's an easy win!.	cubana is the simpler version of floridita and i say that with all the love i can muster for a bar  which  as it turns out  is quite a bit  as the name suggests  it s a cuban themed bar and they do it well  on most nights  you can expect a lively atmosphere  some colourful decorations  and mojitos galore  but what really gets it going are the live acts on the weekends  the last time i was there  the band was composed of three middle aged guys that looked as if they had just strolled in off the streets of havana  they were exceptional musicians and had the whole place dancing up a storm in short order  unlike floridita  where it seems that everyone is a professional salsa dancer  cubana attracts the more amateur crowd and you can muddle your way through the basic steps without feeling too awkward  and after a few of the  17 mojito pitchers  it s unlikely that you ll give a damn and just go for it  they also have some crazy bright green drink  something alligator  which looks ridiculous  tastes delicious  and has enough of a punch to floor an elephant the minor gripe i have is the lack of dancing space given the various rooms and levels the bar is divided into  you can make do  but you re constantly dancing around the stream of people trying to make it to the bathroom or the bar  still  given the fairly cheap drinks prices  the excellent music  and the great location next to waterloo station  it s an easy win

With loads of ice. And fruit that clogged the straw.I liked the location at least. Apart from being accosted by the local homeless people.There are better versions of this type of place in London and certainly WAY better over the pond.	mediocre hokey pseudo cuban bar restaurant the food was uninspired  menu unappetising and staff uncooperative drinks were ok  however  very stingy measures in the cocktails made them taste like gatorade  with loads of ice  and fruit that clogged the straw i liked the location at least  apart from being accosted by the local homeless people there are better versions of this type of place in london and certainly way better over the pond 
1075	4.0	"Some people hate this place. Personally, I can't see why. Is it a corporate re-badging of a quirky Cuban food concept? Possibly but the folks were friendly, the food was very tasty and the restaurant was a pleasant interior decorated in bright equatorial colours. Got in and the place was jumping. The colour scheme is a bit of an assault on the eyes after trudging through the longest rain season in London. Lass at the front takes us to a tiny corner table that had a serious equilibrium issue and one of the legs of the chair I was sitting on was about to give way. As I perched on the corner of the chair, I mentioned it to the fellow who came over first and he rushed away to grab an alternate. So sitting on a much more stable platform, we ordered. Peter, my fellow traveller, ordered the slow cooked beef hash and rice. I was put off by the word hash. I have had some bad experiences with hash in the past, so I ordered the steak. A couple Czech beers later and we were settled in and enjoying looking at the busy restaurant. Food came within 15 minutes and immediately regretted my decision. The steak was great with a really nice salsa verde and a spinach salad, but the ""hash"" looked like classic Barbacoa. Slow cooked beef and then pulled into tasty meaty pieces. It was 5 quid cheaper than the steak and I would say worth twice the price in terms of taste. I would definitely get this the next time here, Lots of options in this area for food but I would say that Cubana is a decent place to go."	some people hate this place  personally  i can t see why  is it a corporate re badging of a quirky cuban food concept  possibly but the folks were friendly  the food was very tasty and the restaurant was a pleasant interior decorated in bright equatorial colours  got in and the place was jumping  the colour scheme is a bit of an assault on the eyes after trudging through the longest rain season in london  lass at the front takes us to a tiny corner table that had a serious equilibrium issue and one of the legs of the chair i was sitting on was about to give way  as i perched on the corner of the chair  i mentioned it to the fellow who came over first and he rushed away to grab an alternate  so sitting on a much more stable platform  we ordered  peter  my fellow traveller  ordered the slow cooked beef hash and rice  i was put off by the word hash  i have had some bad experiences with hash in the past  so i ordered the steak  a couple czech beers later and we were settled in and enjoying looking at the busy restaurant  food came within 15 minutes and immediately regretted my decision  the steak was great with a really nice salsa verde and a spinach salad  but the  hash  looked like classic barbacoa  slow cooked beef and then pulled into tasty meaty pieces  it was 5 quid cheaper than the steak and i would say worth twice the price in terms of taste  i would definitely get this the next time here  lots of options in this area for food but i would say that cubana is a decent place to go

While not the best I've ever had, the ropa vieja was very good and included a lot of food! Plus, if you go around lunchtime on the weekdays the meals are sold street food style and are much cheaper than they are inside the restaurant.

You sense this cubaness rustic feel as you walk in a passport to Havana.I'm giving Cubana five star..! And you may wonder why..! Well, if anyone know me I love Mojito and this vibrate place serve the best mojito hands down. My friend and I were totally surprised on how good this mojito taste. Why did this tasting so good where did the mint come from?? I had to ask .... i was told that the mint came from Spain...!Latin-American chefs & bar staff that know what he is doing.. I try the sharing platter of homemade tapes that just melt in you mouth..

Soul fool at it's finest. Although at first I was a bit concerned about the portion size, it turned out to be just right. The chicken was deliciously stewed and tender (and a healthy size!), the rice was perfectly cooked, the salad was delicious and the cocktails were wonderful.The atmosphere is intimate with the actual space being a nice size, loved the bright colours and murals and the Latin vibe was a wonderful get away from dreary London outside. Can't afford to go to Cuba, well, this may ease your pain a little.Can't wait to try the fuller menu...I will update then.	only eaten there once and looking for any excuse to go back  will you come with me looking for a quick spot to grab a tasty deal one lunch time me and friend tried out the lunch menu  soul fool at it s finest  although at first i was a bit concerned about the portion size  it turned out to be just right  the chicken was deliciously stewed and tender  and a healthy size    the rice was perfectly cooked  the salad was delicious and the cocktails were wonderful the atmosphere is intimate with the actual space being a nice size  loved the bright colours and murals and the latin vibe was a wonderful get away from dreary london outside  can t afford to go to cuba  well  this may ease your pain a little can t wait to try the fuller menu   i will update then 
1079	5.0	Even in the dead of the winter, after a day of bleak skies and light rain, I can turn the corner of Waterloo Station and it all washes away.It's the bright colours! And the guns on the wall! I might have the mind of a small, albeit disturbed child but the pretty colours just make me happy! It's impossible for me to have a bad time in this place...Of course, there is more to it than the paint job. I love cocktails, but I like them simple and strong. Cubana pulls it off with a pure, clean, mojito made with nothing but sugar, mint, and a wine glass of rum. Proper Cuban style. There's also a happy hour, which does indeed make me happy.Granted, the sugar will someday give me heart failure, but I'm ready for it. I'll take one for the team. I'll spend my remaining days drinking good cocktails with a big smile on my face.The food is good but I'd suggest this as a venue for large groups rather than intimate occasions. The menu is made up of sharing platters and Cuban style tapas, best served with a small lounge in the back, crammed full of good friends and enough mojito to drown a bear cub.Yes that's right..

We decided to leave as there was no sign of anyone remotely interested in serving us (or at the least letting us know that there might be a slight delay). Not a word from the hostess either as she saw us leave. This restaurant clearly doesn't care about service. Will definitely not be getting my business in the future.	horrendous experience  waited for 20 mins and no one even bothered to come by our table to take orders  we decided to leave as there was no sign of anyone remotely interested in serving us  or at the least letting us know that there might be a slight delay   not a word from the hostess either as she saw us leave  this restaurant clearly doesn t care about service  will definitely not be getting my business in the future

1088	4.0	It was a happy accident the night I discovered Cubana. From what I remember of the evening it was a barmy summers night, and I had just tottered out of what I thought was the last bar of the night, when all of a sudden, I saw Cubanas bright red star staring down at me. As I walked, ok, staggered towards it, I could hear the loud hum of salsa going strong. There were almost as many people outside as in (the smoking ban had just come in), and I happily paid my £5 to get in. Inside was some kind of wild party with a salsa band playing, people throwing themselves around, everyone having a good time. Someone got me a Cuba Libra and a Mojito, both of which tasted fabulous.What I liked about this place was it felt authentic, not like some other Cuban bars in London which can feel a little contrived. Its also open quite late on a weekend, till 3am, so its a great place to end your evening.	it was a happy accident the night i discovered cubana  from what i remember of the evening it was a barmy summers night  and i had just tottered out of what i thought was the last bar of the night  when all of a sudden  i saw cubanas bright red star staring down at me  as i walked  ok  staggered towards it  i could hear the loud hum of salsa going strong  there were almost as many people outside as in  the smoking ban had just come in   and i happily paid my  5 to get in  inside was some kind of wild party with a salsa band playing  people throwing themselves around  everyone having a good time  someone got me a cuba libra and a mojito  both of which tasted fabulous what i liked about this place was it felt authentic  not like some other cuban bars in london which can feel a little contrived  its also open quite late on a weekend  till 3am  so its a great place to end your evening

Other than that the upstairs mezzanine was a great location, if a little hot before they turned the fans on.I would recommend!	the foodi had here was amazing  for the price charged the quality of the meat was excellent  wash that down with a gingery mojito and you re onto a winner the only slight problem was how busy it was  we were sitting up on one of the decks which meant we weren t in the staffs eye line  could have got more drinks a little quicker  other than that the upstairs mezzanine was a great location  if a little hot before they turned the fans on i would recommend

Cubana Cafe does a fairly decent job of mixing these up for you and you can get them in a pitcher as well, which is totally worth the money.I wasn't there to have food, or listen to the music, so I can't really rate it on those points, but the fact that you can't drink outside after 11pm kinda ruined it for me.All in all, a decent place to check out. I think I would have liked to try the food, next time.	i really do like cuban style drinks  mojitos  cuba libres  etc  all tasty drinks indeed  cubana cafe does a fairly decent job of mixing these up for you and you can get them in a pitcher as well  which is totally worth the money i wasn t there to have food  or listen to the music  so i can t really rate it on those points  but the fact that you can t drink outside after 11pm kinda ruined it for me all in all  a decent place to check out  i think i would have liked to try the food  next time

1096	1.0	"Dear Cubana,Your food is mediocre and over-priced. But that still could have earned you three stars in my book--my standards really aren't that high. It was really the service that got me. Shall I count the ways?10 were the 2-tops that were open when I arrived. Yet, you refused to seat me at any of them claiming they were reserved. Despite an entirely empty restaurant, you put us between two other tables, with 6 inches on either side. In an empty restaurant. Why is that you reserve the tables for the groups that are sharing a £15 jug, when my group of two that you completely shafted on tables spent three times that? I also saw you seat a number of people without reservations at these so-called ""reserved"" tables.6 were the inches between our table and the two on either side of us. It was fun, at least, to find out what first dates were like again because I got to hear two up close and personal. 7 were the tables that were still empty 90 minutes later when we left. Reservations, my ass.30 were the minutes that I waited for my starter, which ended up arriving after my main. Despite me pleading with the waitress for it.1/2 was the flan that you gave me. A flan mold is pretty small generally, so to find that you empty them, cut them in half and serve was heartbreaking.4 was the bites of flan I managed to eke out of my meager dessert. 2 was the times I had to ask for my bill.12.5% was the service charge you tried to hit me with after giving me the worse service I've had in this price range in a long time.1 for the first time I've EVER refused to pay a discretionary service charge. I actually think you must be taking the piss--no one in their right mind would go back here unless they were so hopped up on mojitos that they didn't remember it clearly. I'd love to love you, you're so conveniently located and I love minty drinks. But seriously, fire your waitresses. Or teach them about seating.

Don't dare try and do that.) The whole place smells of sweat and mojitos. I imagine if I'd found myself in here sober, I wouldn't have had nearly as much fun. But fun was had, mojitos were drunk, and I arrived home rather later than planned. Considering how busy it was in here, the service was good and the prices aren't too bad. It's a fiver in, but you get a £1 off voucher meaning our fist cocktail pitcher was just over a tenner, I think they're about £14 otherwise. It's a lot of fun, the live music is a nice touch. Just don't go expecting anything but a great big cocktaily mess.	oh deary me  i came here on saturday and then found myself really rather tipsy after a group of us shared six pitchers of mojitos  six  there was only four of us  it wasn t the cleverest thing i ve ever done  but it was fun  even though the bouncers give you attitude  you can take your drinks outside  but you can t drink out of them  don t dare try and do that   the whole place smells of sweat and mojitos  i imagine if i d found myself in here sober  i wouldn t have had nearly as much fun  but fun was had  mojitos were drunk  and i arrived home rather later than planned  considering how busy it was in here  the service was good and the prices aren t too bad  it s a fiver in  but you get a  1 off voucher meaning our fist cocktail pitcher was just over a tenner  i think they re about  14 otherwise  it s a lot of fun  the live music is a nice touch  just don t go expecting anything but a great big cocktaily mess

I expierenced that the quality of the mojito depends on the weekday and I did spot rotten limes in their lime juicer. So be suspicious of funny tastes...	cubana  right next to the place i live so i pass by quite often  if you go there on weekends and there is live music you can have a great time  i expierenced that the quality of the mojito depends on the weekday and i did spot rotten limes in their lime juicer  so be suspicious of funny tastes   
1101	4.0	As a previous reviewer mentioned, the squeezed juices are tasty indeed. If you fancy something a little more... alcoholic, try their delicious cocktails - they are divine! The Strawberry Mojito is really something else... The cocktails are the usual £6-£7 or you can buy a jug for around £15 - perfect for groups of friends!Their tapas are also worth a mention. The prices are so reasonable - around £4-£5 for tapas. I came here with a group of girlfriends and we had such a giggle getting drunk on jugs of cocktails and eating great food.This won't stretch your wallet by any means and the great atmosphere and brilliant food and drink are an absoloute must for any night out with your significant other or a large group of friends...	as a previous reviewer mentioned  the squeezed juices are tasty indeed  if you fancy something a little more    alcoholic  try their delicious cocktails   they are divine  the strawberry mojito is really something else    the cocktails are the usual  6  7 or you can buy a jug for around  15   perfect for groups of friends their tapas are also worth a mention  the prices are so reasonable   around  4  5 for tapas  i came here with a group of girlfriends and we had such a giggle getting drunk on jugs of cocktails and eating great food this won t stretch your wallet by any means and the great atmosphere and brilliant food and drink are an absoloute must for any night out with your significant other or a large group of friends   
1102	2.0	Bad bad bad mojito, lots of little pieces of broken up mint that I kept sucking up my straw so I had to drink it at a funny angle, luckily I was with an old friend who didn't seem bothered by my strange behaviour and posture. Couldn't taste the rum either, only more mint, very disappointing. We were told there were no tables (at 6 on a tuesday night) and the waitress walked off and left us to fend of ourselves and enquire with the bar staff if it was okay to have a drink standing at the bar.	bad bad bad mojito  lots of little pieces of broken up mint that i kept sucking up my straw so i had to drink it at a funny angle  luckily i was with an old friend who didn t seem bothered by my strange behaviour and posture  couldn t taste the rum either  only more mint  very disappointing  we were told there were no tables  at 6 on a tuesday night  and the waitress walked off and left us to fend of ourselves and enquire with the bar staff if it was okay to have a drink standing at the bar

The old fashioned Cuban dishes and the freshly squeezed juices and premium liquors are part of the night. The food is amazing if your thinking fajitas that is nothing to what they offer on the menue and at cheap affordable meals from £5.00 it is one that you can enjoy without burning a hole in the pocket!. The staff are friendly and extra helpful which stands out from a lot of other resturants i have been to recently . This venue is an excellent pleace for salsa and Latin dance lovers because everyone gets down!	this trendy cuban latino bar restaurant makes you feel a bit of the atmosphere of the island  the old fashioned cuban dishes and the freshly squeezed juices and premium liquors are part of the night  the food is amazing if your thinking fajitas that is nothing to what they offer on the menue and at cheap affordable meals from  5 00 it is one that you can enjoy without burning a hole in the pocket   the staff are friendly and extra helpful which stands out from a lot of other resturants i have been to recently   this venue is an excellent pleace for salsa and latin dance lovers because everyone gets down 
1104	4.0	I like a little bit of Cubana, a place which retains a lot of soul and is very close to the southbank- bonus! Considerably cheap for the area and for what they have to offer, I would reccomend this place to groups of friends wanting to have a raucous meal out. They take bookings for up to six people which is advisable.I would reccomend some of the chicken dishes, spiced to perfection, and then the traditional coconut tart, heaven on the tastebuds. Don't stuff yourself too much though, as you will need to leave some breathing space to dance later on.The cocktails are really good, of course you should drink Cuba Libre. The atmosphere of the place is wild and authentic, the crowd is genuine and bonafide and everyone just wants to have a good time. If you are looking for a change from the normal London scene, then I would seriously advise that you give this place a good visit, maybe even plan a whole night, starting with a meal, moving onto drinkies and ending on your feet having a jive.	i like a little bit of cubana  a place which retains a lot of soul and is very close to the southbank  bonus  considerably cheap for the area and for what they have to offer  i would reccomend this place to groups of friends wanting to have a raucous meal out  they take bookings for up to six people which is advisable i would reccomend some of the chicken dishes  spiced to perfection  and then the traditional coconut tart  heaven on the tastebuds  don t stuff yourself too much though  as you will need to leave some breathing space to dance later on the cocktails are really good  of course you should drink cuba libre  the atmosphere of the place is wild and authentic  the crowd is genuine and bonafide and everyone just wants to have a good time  if you are looking for a change from the normal london scene  then i would seriously advise that you give this place a good visit  maybe even plan a whole night  starting with a meal  moving onto drinkies and ending on your feet having a jive 
1105	5.0	Oh Cubana! Aie aie aie!  Somebody quick, find me some castanets!  Cubana is just down the street from where I live and for a long time, I neglected it.  What a mistake.  Finally, one night, twas not a dark and stormy night, but a night nonetheless, I went to Cubana.  It was love at first sight.  We're going to get married in the fall, Cubana and I. So what do I love about Cubana?  Let me count the ways:1.  Decor.  Paintings of Latin figureheads on the walls.  Colors like a street parade in Key West.  A ripple painted around the place where one of the large lighting fixtures meets the ceiling as though the ceiling was a body of water.2.  Drinks.  Fresh fruit cocktails.  Crush me up those strawberries and lemons, raspberries and pineapple, and, baby, you've got delicious.  Although a bit pricey, the cocktails are scrumptious.3.  Music.  Oh salsa, oh tango, oh bachata, oh flamenco... oh Latin music how I love thee.  Both times I've been to Cubana, there has been a live band playing excellent Latin music - the kind that makes your hips have a life of their own as you groove groove groove away to the funky beats.  Mm mm I love it.Cubana is great - you should go there.  They charge an entry fee after 10 or 11 on the weekends, so go early.  But by all means, go!	oh cubana  aie aie aie   somebody quick  find me some castanets   cubana is just down the street from where i live and for a long time  i neglected it   what a mistake   finally  one night  twas not a dark and stormy night  but a night nonetheless  i went to cubana   it was love at first sight   we re going to get married in the fall  cubana and i  so what do i love about cubana   let me count the ways 1   decor   paintings of latin figureheads on the walls   colors like a street parade in key west   a ripple painted around the place where one of the large lighting fixtures meets the ceiling as though the ceiling was a body of water 2   drinks   fresh fruit cocktails   crush me up those strawberries and lemons  raspberries and pineapple  and  baby  you ve got delicious   although a bit pricey  the cocktails are scrumptious 3   music   oh salsa  oh tango  oh bachata  oh flamenco    oh latin music how i love thee   both times i ve been to cubana  there has been a live band playing excellent latin music   the kind that makes your hips have a life of their own as you groove groove groove away to the funky beats   mm mm i love it cubana is great   you should go there   they charge an entry fee after 10 or 11 on the weekends  so go early   but by all means  go

1107	3.0	Some colleagues from out of town were in for a couple of days combined with a great two for one drinks offer made for a great evening excursion. The staff seemed a bit confused about the special, but in the end it all worked out. By 8 o'clock on a thursday the place was humming with activity. We grabbed a couple of tables for ten in the corner just to the left of the entrance which also made a great place for people watching. (There was a very tall woman who had hunched shoulders. We surmised it must be because she always has to lean over to talk to people). The seating is arranged on several different levels, each separated by a few stairs. It is a great layout to give an overall sense of activity and vibe, but still allows groups to have a bit of their own space. It is conveniently located just a 200 meter walk from the entry to waterloo train and tube station.	some colleagues from out of town were in for a couple of days combined with a great two for one drinks offer made for a great evening excursion  the staff seemed a bit confused about the special  but in the end it all worked out  by 8 o clock on a thursday the place was humming with activity  we grabbed a couple of tables for ten in the corner just to the left of the entrance which also made a great place for people watching   there was a very tall woman who had hunched shoulders  we surmised it must be because she always has to lean over to talk to people   the seating is arranged on several different levels  each separated by a few stairs  it is a great layout to give an overall sense of activity and vibe  but still allows groups to have a bit of their own space  it is conveniently located just a 200 meter walk from the entry to waterloo train and tube station 
1108	4.0	Book in advance, we held a 50th Birthday party here for 15 people, the quality of the food was superb with all of us eating together and without feeling rushed but it was clear that you didn't have a chance of getting in without a reservation. Main courses range from about £6.00, i tried the Garbanzos Grillios with Chirozo - this was a chickpea stew with garlic and coriander and simply oozed flavour. The cocktails were fresh and very, very tasty (from what we can remember), especially those with lashings of fresh crushed mint leaves - buy the pitchers they work out better value. After dinner the restaurant becomes part of the bar with live music. Well worth staying around for after you've eaten. One tip - wear as little as possible this place gets very, very warm.	book in advance  we held a 50th birthday party here for 15 people  the quality of the food was superb with all of us eating together and without feeling rushed but it was clear that you didn t have a chance of getting in without a reservation  main courses range from about  6 00  i tried the garbanzos grillios with chirozo   this was a chickpea stew with garlic and coriander and simply oozed flavour  the cocktails were fresh and very  very tasty  from what we can remember   especially those with lashings of fresh crushed mint leaves   buy the pitchers they work out better value  after dinner the restaurant becomes part of the bar with live music  well worth staying around for after you ve eaten  one tip   wear as little as possible this place gets very  very warm 
1109	3.0	It was pretty quiet when we went in on a Thursday night. The cocktails were good but the tables are quite cramped due to the interesting shape of the building, lots of chairs wedged into nooks and crannies. We loved the decor, and felt inspired to join the Spanish revolution, fortunately for us it was over. The bar staff said they'd bring our cocktail over once it was ready and then tried to charge us an extra 2 quid for table service we hadn't asked for, so don't agree to them bringing you your drinks, wait at the bar for them. The upstairs bathroom was fine but the downstairs ladies appeared to have been host to some sort of pitched battle as several things were broken. We seem to have gone on the wrong night for music, only the echo of a dodgy electric keyboard playing Auld Lang Syne. It was shortly after New Year.	it was pretty quiet when we went in on a thursday night  the cocktails were good but the tables are quite cramped due to the interesting shape of the building  lots of chairs wedged into nooks and crannies  we loved the decor  and felt inspired to join the spanish revolution  fortunately for us it was over  the bar staff said they d bring our cocktail over once it was ready and then tried to charge us an extra 2 quid for table service we hadn t asked for  so don t agree to them bringing you your drinks  wait at the bar for them  the upstairs bathroom was fine but the downstairs ladies appeared to have been host to some sort of pitched battle as several things were broken  we seem to have gone on the wrong night for music  only the echo of a dodgy electric keyboard playing auld lang syne  it was shortly after new year

1111	4.0	Went there mid April. Nice place, turned up without a prior booking on a Friday immediately after work so it was due to be busy. Got a table for two within 5 minutes. Waitreses were very pleasant and helped with suggestions on the Cuban food. It was happy hour, two cocktails for the price of one. So felt it was a great deal on the drinks. Food was fine too and all reasonably priced. I would go back there again for a more leisurely meal and experiment.	went there mid april  nice place  turned up without a prior booking on a friday immediately after work so it was due to be busy  got a table for two within 5 minutes  waitreses were very pleasant and helped with suggestions on the cuban food  it was happy hour  two cocktails for the price of one  so felt it was a great deal on the drinks  food was fine too and all reasonably priced  i would go back there again for a more leisurely meal and experiment 
1112	4.0	Cubana is a busy little bar and restaurant that is quite good fun for jugs of cocktail and unusual cuban food. they also have live music on many nights which adds a nice flavour. I will say though that sometimes their happy hour jugs don't appear to pack the same punch as the full price variety and when it gets packed (and it does) the staff get a bit knarky in my experience. If you are going on a wed-sat eve and want a table, book ahead!	cubana is a busy little bar and restaurant that is quite good fun for jugs of cocktail and unusual cuban food  they also have live music on many nights which adds a nice flavour  i will say though that sometimes their happy hour jugs don t appear to pack the same punch as the full price variety and when it gets packed  and it does  the staff get a bit knarky in my experience  if you are going on a wed sat eve and want a table  book ahead 
1113	5.0	I've never actually eaten here (though the food looks FAB), but the cocktails at Cubana are to die for. The best mojitos & sangria in town, easily. Large selection of tequilias on offer and generally a quite extensive cocktail list. Prices aren't super cheap, but considering you're in the heart of Waterloo, they aren't half-bad either. Great for parties or just some fun times with a couple of friends. They offer theme nights and things like salsa-dancing lessons & real Cuban cigars for sale.	i ve never actually eaten here  though the food looks fab   but the cocktails at cubana are to die for  the best mojitos   sangria in town  easily  large selection of tequilias on offer and generally a quite extensive cocktail list  prices aren t super cheap  but considering you re in the heart of waterloo  they aren t half bad either  great for parties or just some fun times with a couple of friends  they offer theme nights and things like salsa dancing lessons   real cuban cigars for sale 
1114	3.0	For me this is a really good place to get drinks as they do a great selection of cocktails with some good deals on pitchers during happy hour. I'm a particular fan of their mojitis and margaritas. I've eaten here a couple of times in the evening and while the food was good, it seemed a bit pricy. They do have a good lunch special though which I would recommend, it's good value and delicious.	for me this is a really good place to get drinks as they do a great selection of cocktails with some good deals on pitchers during happy hour  i m a particular fan of their mojitis and margaritas  i ve eaten here a couple of times in the evening and while the food was good  it seemed a bit pricy  they do have a good lunch special though which i would recommend  it s good value and delicious 
1115	5.0	This place is fantastic. The cocktails are all freshly made with quality ingredients and taste absolutely amazing. The food is really great too and I love the tapas. Sharing them with friends over some cocktails with the live music that plays Thursdays to Sundays is really good fun. The decor inside coupled with the music creates a really cool, latin atmosphere. There is seating staggered on different levels and you can also sit outside in good weather. The layout is really unconventional and quirky but it all fits in perfectly with the theme of the restaurant. A friend of mine rented out the entire restaurant for a party and that was great fun too as there is a dancefloor in front of the bar.	this place is fantastic  the cocktails are all freshly made with quality ingredients and taste absolutely amazing  the food is really great too and i love the tapas  sharing them with friends over some cocktails with the live music that plays thursdays to sundays is really good fun  the decor inside coupled with the music creates a really cool  latin atmosphere  there is seating staggered on different levels and you can also sit outside in good weather  the layout is really unconventional and quirky but it all fits in perfectly with the theme of the restaurant  a friend of mine rented out the entire restaurant for a party and that was great fun too as there is a dancefloor in front of the bar

You can't go wrong with a jug of mojito. The food is what you expect, with a wide variety of tapas as well as main dishes (the latter are quiet resonable at around a tenner). There is also a childrens menu (not sure what this is like though) and if there are enough of you then you can opt for the buffet. Like many places it can get very busy and when it is peak times they certainly dont let you sit there for hours.	there are lots of places you can get something to eat along lower marsh   pubs and the like   but none as fun and colourful as cubana  the cocktails are great and come by the jug full  you can t go wrong with a jug of mojito  the food is what you expect  with a wide variety of tapas as well as main dishes  the latter are quiet resonable at around a tenner   there is also a childrens menu  not sure what this is like though  and if there are enough of you then you can opt for the buffet  like many places it can get very busy and when it is peak times they certainly dont let you sit there for hours

1121	1.0	The cocktails were alright and decent value, but the food was pretty terrible. The chicken and chorizo stew had absolutely no chorizo in it and two piffling bits of chicken. I think they were trying to save money by palming off some potato and chickpeas for £10 a meal. The tuna was also overcooked and rubbish. We sent them both back and got no apology, but they seemed used to taking bad food back. The fact we were the only food reservation all night says it all really. I'd go there for a drink or two, but never eat there again.	the cocktails were alright and decent value  but the food was pretty terrible  the chicken and chorizo stew had absolutely no chorizo in it and two piffling bits of chicken  i think they were trying to save money by palming off some potato and chickpeas for  10 a meal  the tuna was also overcooked and rubbish  we sent them both back and got no apology  but they seemed used to taking bad food back  the fact we were the only food reservation all night says it all really  i d go there for a drink or two  but never eat there again

1123	4.0	My friend reserved a table here to celebrate her birthday, and we ended up having such a great time. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you're in the middle of Cuba, with Spanish music playing in the background, and a very South American atmosphere. It's filled with colourful paintings and wall sculptures, which include a massive gun, unloaded of course. The interior is bright and florescent with wooden furnishings to give it an authentic Cuban feel. I also sensed that the place had regular Cuban bar-goers who were friends with the South American waitresses. The dishes include tapas, tortilla, falafel, and very traditional Cuban dishes, which were not only tasty but very spicy! So take my advice and make sure you ask how hot the meals are before ordering. The cost for Cuban cuisine and alcohol were reasonable with cocktail jugs at £15 and coffee with rum from £4. They even had chocolate cake, which I must say was extremely sweet. However, there were a couple of down sides such as the main course menu, which wasn't vegetarian friendly. If you don't believe me, check the website as it is kind enough to have its menu uploaded online. Also, it's very loud and crowded by 9pm, particularly on a Saturday, where every one tries to dance to Salsa in such a confined space.	my friend reserved a table here to celebrate her birthday  and we ended up having such a great time  as soon as you walk in  you feel like you re in the middle of cuba  with spanish music playing in the background  and a very south american atmosphere  it s filled with colourful paintings and wall sculptures  which include a massive gun  unloaded of course  the interior is bright and florescent with wooden furnishings to give it an authentic cuban feel  i also sensed that the place had regular cuban bar goers who were friends with the south american waitresses  the dishes include tapas  tortilla  falafel  and very traditional cuban dishes  which were not only tasty but very spicy  so take my advice and make sure you ask how hot the meals are before ordering  the cost for cuban cuisine and alcohol were reasonable with cocktail jugs at  15 and coffee with rum from  4  they even had chocolate cake  which i must say was extremely sweet  however  there were a couple of down sides such as the main course menu  which wasn t vegetarian friendly  if you don t believe me  check the website as it is kind enough to have its menu uploaded online  also  it s very loud and crowded by 9pm  particularly on a saturday  where every one tries to dance to salsa in such a confined space

1125	4.0	Having a nice staycation in East London this weekend? Remember to swing by Pizza East! It's just right opposite boxpark and shoreditch overground Station.This place has good vibes, absolutely in love with the industrial interior design. Single tables are a little tight for two. I'd suggest you go for the round ones if there's one available.I wouldn't say this is artisinal pizza or anything fancy like that. It's just different. We had the Veal meatball and shrimp chilly. The veal is a little salty for my liking, but I thoroughly enjoyed having both. I usually don't eat my crust but this was just next level. I hope they consider cheesy crust next time.We also bone marrow with cipollini and burrata to start. The bone marrow is a must try. It comes in threes with the marrow juice between the bones. Personally I wouldn't share this because it's not a whole lot, also its incredibly addictive. The burrata presentation wasnt half as impressive but I'd say the cheese was equally amazing.They have really nice cocktails available here. We had Salento (hendricks gin and pineapple) and a Streaga. Not the cheapest cocktails around! £9.75 each. Finally finished off with tiramisu and coffee.Total bill came up to less than £85 for two. This includes two starters, two cocktails, two pizzas, one dessert and two coffees. A little upscale but definitely worth the bill.	having a nice staycation in east london this weekend  remember to swing by pizza east  it s just right opposite boxpark and shoreditch overground station this place has good vibes  absolutely in love with the industrial interior design  single tables are a little tight for two  i d suggest you go for the round ones if there s one available i wouldn t say this is artisinal pizza or anything fancy like that  it s just different  we had the veal meatball and shrimp chilly  the veal is a little salty for my liking  but i thoroughly enjoyed having both  i usually don t eat my crust but this was just next level  i hope they consider cheesy crust next time we also bone marrow with cipollini and burrata to start  the bone marrow is a must try  it comes in threes with the marrow juice between the bones  personally i wouldn t share this because it s not a whole lot  also its incredibly addictive  the burrata presentation wasnt half as impressive but i d say the cheese was equally amazing they have really nice cocktails available here  we had salento  hendricks gin and pineapple  and a streaga  not the cheapest cocktails around   9 75 each  finally finished off with tiramisu and coffee total bill came up to less than  85 for two  this includes two starters  two cocktails  two pizzas  one dessert and two coffees  a little upscale but definitely worth the bill 
1126	4.0	Yessssss delicious pizza! And from the mouth of a New Yorker, this means something. Typical NY, thin-crust pizza with a hint of burned crust. Loads of toppings and flavours. I got the aubergine and pesto pizza with squash added a top. Not one topping was skimped on. The rich roasted aubergine and thin-sliced squash, together with the tomato sauce, are just fabulous. I ate the whole pizza! The price gives me sideye- at £12 a medium-sized pie, it's not cheap- but it's so damn good I would return. It wasn't overly busy when we stopped by this Sunday afternoon. Just dinking a star because my husband had the burrata antipasti and the cheese is pretty bland. Have had far better burrata at Obica and in NY. Also the glass of Pinot Grigio (decent enough) is pretty pricey at £8/glass. But my husband said the lamb meatballs were quite tasty.	yessssss delicious pizza  and from the mouth of a new yorker  this means something  typical ny  thin crust pizza with a hint of burned crust  loads of toppings and flavours  i got the aubergine and pesto pizza with squash added a top  not one topping was skimped on  the rich roasted aubergine and thin sliced squash  together with the tomato sauce  are just fabulous  i ate the whole pizza  the price gives me sideye  at  12 a medium sized pie  it s not cheap  but it s so damn good i would return  it wasn t overly busy when we stopped by this sunday afternoon  just dinking a star because my husband had the burrata antipasti and the cheese is pretty bland  have had far better burrata at obica and in ny  also the glass of pinot grigio  decent enough  is pretty pricey at  8 glass  but my husband said the lamb meatballs were quite tasty

Maybe the concept is to reflect a kitchen table but falls flat.- Pizza was soggy- Communal tables tight and cramped- beer selection was really poor with limited craft options- Service was dire. They add a discretionary service charge which is fine but we opted to deduct 2 euro to reflect experience and the server returned to question as if we had failed toboay. We explained our reason but he was biligerant.  Tip is always discretionary so done expect and certainly never come back to a table as if to assert the bill was left shortThere are no positives. We left bewildered and personally I was furious by such poor manners.Good luck to those who enjoy but not for me and certainly failed to deliver any rustic Italian hospitality.	by far the worst dining experience in many many years negatives  the bar area to wait while your table is ready is chaotic and slow  maybe the concept is to reflect a kitchen table but falls flat   pizza was soggy  communal tables tight and cramped  beer selection was really poor with limited craft options  service was dire  they add a discretionary service charge which is fine but we opted to deduct 2 euro to reflect experience and the server returned to question as if we had failed toboay  we explained our reason but he was biligerant   tip is always discretionary so done expect and certainly never come back to a table as if to assert the bill was left shortthere are no positives  we left bewildered and personally i was furious by such poor manners good luck to those who enjoy but not for me and certainly failed to deliver any rustic italian hospitality

The decor and ambiance were the cherries on top of the dining experience. The pizza here is probably the best pizza I've had since coming to London.	pizza was delicious  with several unique choices  and fairly reasonably priced  service was very friendly as well and our pizzas came out quickly  the decor and ambiance were the cherries on top of the dining experience  the pizza here is probably the best pizza i ve had since coming to london 
1129	3.0	Had dinner here on a Monday night (50% night) & must declare an interest inasmuch as my mate is on good terms with the staff therefore any waiting around or service issues experienced by other reviewers weren't evident & may or may not have been down to that.Can't comment on the beer selection as wasn't in the mood for one at that point so just opted for a soft, which was oddly supplied as two small bottles of Canada Dry.No complaints about the olive and bread with dip starters we had or with the pizza, which they were happy to box up the remains of for later consumption. As it was half price night it's difficult for me to say whether I'd go in any other time but it's in the back of my mind if I find myself in the area on a Monday again.	had dinner here on a monday night  50  night    must declare an interest inasmuch as my mate is on good terms with the staff therefore any waiting around or service issues experienced by other reviewers weren t evident   may or may not have been down to that can t comment on the beer selection as wasn t in the mood for one at that point so just opted for a soft  which was oddly supplied as two small bottles of canada dry no complaints about the olive and bread with dip starters we had or with the pizza  which they were happy to box up the remains of for later consumption  as it was half price night it s difficult for me to say whether i d go in any other time but it s in the back of my mind if i find myself in the area on a monday again

And of course it's a great location. Plus the pizza was still good...fresh mushrooms, great dough, etc...

We started sharing delicious lamb meatball then we had one salami and one truffle pizza, both savory and well cooked. We also shared a strawberry cheesecake.The waiter was nice and the food arrived quickly.The location was very cool, but it's a loud place.The price is fine.	this is a very nice pizzeria in the heart of shoreditch the quality of the food is high  we started sharing delicious lamb meatball then we had one salami and one truffle pizza  both savory and well cooked  we also shared a strawberry cheesecake the waiter was nice and the food arrived quickly the location was very cool  but it s a loud place the price is fine

1135	3.0	Came here last night for dinner around 8:30pm and it was super packed- about a 45 mins wait for walk ins. Good thing we had reservations. Between my friend and I, we shared: -Black Truffle, Taleggio, Mozzarella, Parmesan pizza: I loved how cheesy + savory this was! Only wished the crust was more crispy/less droopy. -Butter lettuce avocado salad: Simple yet tasty. Very mustardy dressing, perhaps a tad too salty for my taste. -Cauliflower: we were not expecting a huge head of cauliflower! Never had it with yogurt and salsa. Really good and made the meal way more balanced. I washed everything down with a Camden Pale Ale. Pretty good combo!Very casual, industrial feel. Soap and hand lotion smells so good!	came here last night for dinner around 8 30pm and it was super packed  about a 45 mins wait for walk ins  good thing we had reservations  between my friend and i  we shared   black truffle  taleggio  mozzarella  parmesan pizza  i loved how cheesy   savory this was  only wished the crust was more crispy less droopy   butter lettuce avocado salad  simple yet tasty  very mustardy dressing  perhaps a tad too salty for my taste   cauliflower  we were not expecting a huge head of cauliflower  never had it with yogurt and salsa  really good and made the meal way more balanced  i washed everything down with a camden pale ale  pretty good combo very casual  industrial feel  soap and hand lotion smells so good

1137	3.0	Delicious dishes, especially burrata and the broccoli salad. Good wine selection. However the place is VERY loud, if you are more than 3 you will not be able to hear each other. Also, quite expensive to be just pizza and salads.	delicious dishes  especially burrata and the broccoli salad  good wine selection  however the place is very loud  if you are more than 3 you will not be able to hear each other  also  quite expensive to be just pizza and salads 
1138	3.0	Love the atmosphere here! Very rustic looking, dim lighting and lots of chandeliers. The ceiling looks very industrial like it was once a warehouse and the floors are panels of wood (like a boardwalk). They also have an open kitchen concept and lots of seating.As for service, we were seated right away as we had reservations and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly.To drink I got a mojito -- not the best but definitely not the worst. I know mojitos are supposed to full of half ice but this was filled over the top and after a few sips my mojito was done. Our food came about less than 10 minutes after ordering which was amazing as we were both starving! To eat I got the pizza with eggplant and spinach on it (I forget the actual name on the menu) and my niece got the spicy sausage pizza which she really enjoyed. My pizza on the other hand was mediocre. We both agreed that the crust could not hold up the toppings at all so when lifting a slice of pizza it would literally droop down. Overall I enjoyed this place and its atmosphere. However, I would give this place 3 stars which is what I rated it as it was not the best pizza I've ever had but it was good. For a pizza place, you don't expect the toppings on a pizza to literally slide off the dough, cheese and all.

We would have left for another restaurant in the meantime, had we know the wait would be so long. But we have been told several times ""the table will be ready in just 20 minutes"".

So much for sobering up lol. Their pizza is delicious, comparable to NYC brick oven pizza. I love how large the restaurant is, the ambience, and the servers. This was my second time here and won't be my last, will continue to come here when in London/Shoreditch.	had the mozzarella and basil pizza and potatoes after bar hopping with a friend on a friday night  with my pizza i had  a vodka soda that had plenty of vodka in it  so much for sobering up lol  their pizza is delicious  comparable to nyc brick oven pizza  i love how large the restaurant is  the ambience  and the servers  this was my second time here and won t be my last  will continue to come here when in london shoreditch

1142	4.0	"Our beloved Tequila Girl 1 selected this resto having spent time researching a place in London that could accommodate my allergies, bless her heart. Five stars for the food, two for the décor and atmosphere and four for the service. Inside - only one seating option was offered for our group of four which was a communal table.  No issue there; I was raised to share. The problem were the seats. How to describe? Think uncomfortable bar stools that are attached to a post by a swinging arm, like university chairs but without a back portion. Not good for the disabled among us. Volume - loud. Really loud. Again, not an issue for us, but I wouldn't take grandma there. You have to shout to be heard even by the person sitting next to you. Atmosphere is industrial depot meets Italian grocery store. It came as no surprise that this is a converted tea warehouse.Service - we stressed my allergies, and the server heard them, but the kitchen didn't receive that message so my pizza had to be sent back. They automatically add a 12.5% gratuity to the bill which is referred to as ""discretionary"", a misnomer at best. This puts the customer in the uncomfortable position of asking to have it removed, if unwanted. If they sincerely intended to make it at the customer's option then that would be the recommended gratuity, not the default. Except in the worst of circumstances I always tip generously, but I'm not keen to have it taken in this fashion.Drinks - they sell very large bottles of Peroni (€7.50). Tip: if more than one of your party are ordering beer then just order one bottle at a time and split it. That way the next one will be cold. Look at me, always with the planning. Sparkling water was only €2, which was the best deal of the whole trip. A carafe of a very nice rosé was €16.Food - Once the edible version of my order arrived it was fantastic. Everyone in our group ordered pizza and enjoyed it (€14). It's Napoletano, with that great charred veneer and thin crust. TG1 and her beau shared the meatball appetizer (€6). Overall, we had a great time. My only hesitancy about returning would be that a reservation is a necessity in order to secure better seating, and we don't like to make reservations when on vacation so that we aren't tied to a schedule. If I were in the neighbourhood and they had something other than the communal tables available I would happily go back."	our beloved tequila girl 1 selected this resto having spent time researching a place in london that could accommodate my allergies  bless her heart  five stars for the food  two for the d cor and atmosphere and four for the service  inside   only one seating option was offered for our group of four which was a communal table   no issue there  i was raised to share  the problem were the seats  how to describe  think uncomfortable bar stools that are attached to a post by a swinging arm  like university chairs but without a back portion  not good for the disabled among us  volume   loud  really loud  again  not an issue for us  but i wouldn t take grandma there  you have to shout to be heard even by the person sitting next to you  atmosphere is industrial depot meets italian grocery store  it came as no surprise that this is a converted tea warehouse service   we stressed my allergies  and the server heard them  but the kitchen didn t receive that message so my pizza had to be sent back  they automatically add a 12 5  gratuity to the bill which is referred to as  discretionary   a misnomer at best  this puts the customer in the uncomfortable position of asking to have it removed  if unwanted  if they sincerely intended to make it at the customer s option then that would be the recommended gratuity  not the default  except in the worst of circumstances i always tip generously  but i m not keen to have it taken in this fashion drinks   they sell very large bottles of peroni   7 50   tip  if more than one of your party are ordering beer then just order one bottle at a time and split it  that way the next one will be cold  look at me  always with the planning  sparkling water was only  2  which was the best deal of the whole trip  a carafe of a very nice ros  was  16 food   once the edible version of my order arrived it was fantastic  everyone in our group ordered pizza and enjoyed it   14   it s napoletano  with that great charred veneer and thin crust  tg1 and her beau shared the meatball appetizer   6   overall  we had a great time  my only hesitancy about returning would be that a reservation is a necessity in order to secure better seating  and we don t like to make reservations when on vacation so that we aren t tied to a schedule  if i were in the neighbourhood and they had something other than the communal tables available i would happily go back

If you've cleverly booked in advance (or you've got a date with good chat to distract you - check!) then go for it!It's possibly the most hipster pizza place in town - industrial-chic (read: unfinished) interior with exposed ceiling vents, lighting so low you can barely read the menu, a menu full of ingredients you don't understand, and very lovely waiters who all have beards and tattoos.It's not perfect - the pizzas aren't cheap and the middles go a little soggy. But the bases taste fresh and the toppings are certainly interesting. Watch out for the nduja one - it almost fried my tastebuds it was so chilli! I do like the compact cocktail selection too - my 'New Fashioned' on Saturday really hit the spot. Come for these and the fun buzzy vibe, just not for the pizzas.	don t even bother trying this place on a weekend eve if you haven t booked   unless you don t mind a 50 minute wait in their packed out bar area  which they ll claim will be 30mins   if you ve cleverly booked in advance  or you ve got a date with good chat to distract you   check   then go for it it s possibly the most hipster pizza place in town   industrial chic  read  unfinished  interior with exposed ceiling vents  lighting so low you can barely read the menu  a menu full of ingredients you don t understand  and very lovely waiters who all have beards and tattoos it s not perfect   the pizzas aren t cheap and the middles go a little soggy  but the bases taste fresh and the toppings are certainly interesting  watch out for the nduja one   it almost fried my tastebuds it was so chilli  i do like the compact cocktail selection too   my  new fashioned  on saturday really hit the spot  come for these and the fun buzzy vibe  just not for the pizzas

1148	4.0	Very nice meal here. Loved the vibe/atmosphere. Pizza (mozz/tomato/basil) wasn't amazing but still pretty good - very thin. Make sure you ask for the chili oil to dip your crust in! Appetizers were delicious. Really enjoyed the prawns as well as the honeycomb bruschetta with fig and burrata - YUM. My bf also loved the pork belly appetizer. Gripes - they wouldn't customize a pie with just half salami. Also saw a bug running across the side of the bar....looked like a small roach.	very nice meal here  loved the vibe atmosphere  pizza  mozz tomato basil  wasn t amazing but still pretty good   very thin  make sure you ask for the chili oil to dip your crust in  appetizers were delicious  really enjoyed the prawns as well as the honeycomb bruschetta with fig and burrata   yum  my bf also loved the pork belly appetizer  gripes   they wouldn t customize a pie with just half salami  also saw a bug running across the side of the bar    looked like a small roach

Plus the pizza got cold very fast.I had a marguerita and a Spicy salami, something like that. The second one is a great recipe, congrats!Now, they need to improve a little the dough, is too thin, and I don`t recommend this unit because is packed, or if you like the hype, go for it.London needs to improve their Pizza, very little looks appetizing.	i went to the place pizza east after hearing about it hype indeed the place was packed on a monday 6 30pm  amazing  the environment is very cool too they have a 50  off on monday for whoever applied to a special ring to have this discount  go for it now   the foodis not as good as people think it is  the pizza is just ok  the crust is to thin and lacks flavor  plus the pizza got cold very fast i had a marguerita and a spicy salami  something like that  the second one is a great recipe  congrats now  they need to improve a little the dough  is too thin  and i don t recommend this unit because is packed  or if you like the hype  go for it london needs to improve their pizza  very little looks appetizing

1152	3.0	Good pizza but the service is pretty bad. Waited for a seat. After being seated took over 15 minutes for them to take our order. After we ordered food came out quick and was good.Got the salami pizza , mushroom pizza and margerita.Don't get the garlic bread it's drenched in oil. Probably half a glass of oil per slice. Strawberry panna cotta was pretty good too. After were done eating it took the server 15 minutes to clear our table. Then some more time to take desert order and now have been waiting to pay for the last 15 minutes.Overall not worth the wait.	good pizza but the service is pretty bad  waited for a seat  after being seated took over 15 minutes for them to take our order  after we ordered food came out quick and was good got the salami pizza   mushroom pizza and margerita don t get the garlic bread it s drenched in oil  probably half a glass of oil per slice  strawberry panna cotta was pretty good too  after were done eating it took the server 15 minutes to clear our table  then some more time to take desert order and now have been waiting to pay for the last 15 minutes overall not worth the wait 
1153	4.0	Pizza East is in Shoreditch, housed in the Tea Building which is home to Shoreditch House and Dirty Burger - all of which are owned by the Soho House Group.The interior has a warehouse feel about it and is open, with high ceilings and an industrial vibe. At the entrance, there is a small area with a big wooden table in the centre for drinks and charcuterie. Venture further in and you have the main dining area, with a central bar dotted with high stools for bar dining. It can get very busy with walk-ins during lunch time, so a colleague and I booked a table for two. The style of service is informal and friendly which is perfect for lunch. We were greeted immediately at our tables, but given time to scan the menu. I was so hungry, which from experience should tell me I will order more than I can eat. Regardless, I went for two courses.To start, I had barolo carpaccio, shaved pecorino and girolles. Oh my god, I love mushrooms in dishes, especially the more wild and exotic variations. AND I also love cheese, so two out of three favourites on my plate! The carpaccio stood up to these two favourite ingredients of mine, with its slightly smoky taste. My colleague had bruschetta with fig and burrata which I have obsessed about in previous reviews, as it is the most of delicate of Italian cheeses with a sold outer shell and smooth creamy inside. Lush starters thank you very much.The main course is where my eyes proved to be bigger than my stomach. Crispy pork belly, served with salsa verde, red cabbage and butter beans. Wow. The pork belly meat was tender and was perfectly partnered with the finely chopped herbs, garlic and other bits. It was an effort to work through this epic portion of meat. I was reluctant to leave any of it, but I literally could not take any more. Perhaps best to miss out a starter with this dish to ensure you lick the plate clean.As a vegetarian, my fellow diner had the pizza with artichokes, tomato, rocket and marjoram. Good pizza and a good price.A good spot for lunch, but I imagine that it will also great on the long wooden tables with a group of friends too for an evening session. I will definitely be back here soon.	pizza east is in shoreditch  housed in the tea building which is home to shoreditch house and dirty burger   all of which are owned by the soho house group the interior has a warehouse feel about it and is open  with high ceilings and an industrial vibe  at the entrance  there is a small area with a big wooden table in the centre for drinks and charcuterie  venture further in and you have the main dining area  with a central bar dotted with high stools for bar dining  it can get very busy with walk ins during lunch time  so a colleague and i booked a table for two  the style of service is informal and friendly which is perfect for lunch  we were greeted immediately at our tables  but given time to scan the menu  i was so hungry  which from experience should tell me i will order more than i can eat  regardless  i went for two courses to start  i had barolo carpaccio  shaved pecorino and girolles  oh my god  i love mushrooms in dishes  especially the more wild and exotic variations  and i also love cheese  so two out of three favourites on my plate  the carpaccio stood up to these two favourite ingredients of mine  with its slightly smoky taste  my colleague had bruschetta with fig and burrata which i have obsessed about in previous reviews  as it is the most of delicate of italian cheeses with a sold outer shell and smooth creamy inside  lush starters thank you very much the main course is where my eyes proved to be bigger than my stomach  crispy pork belly  served with salsa verde  red cabbage and butter beans  wow  the pork belly meat was tender and was perfectly partnered with the finely chopped herbs  garlic and other bits  it was an effort to work through this epic portion of meat  i was reluctant to leave any of it  but i literally could not take any more  perhaps best to miss out a starter with this dish to ensure you lick the plate clean as a vegetarian  my fellow diner had the pizza with artichokes  tomato  rocket and marjoram  good pizza and a good price a good spot for lunch  but i imagine that it will also great on the long wooden tables with a group of friends too for an evening session  i will definitely be back here soon

1155	3.0	"Yes it's me, the lactose-intolerant pizza-lover. Ok, I'm a conundrum. But places like Pizza East help. I emailed in advance to ask if there was any lactose in the crust and if they could make a cheeseless pizza for me, and they emailed back not ten minutes later saying I'd be safely lactose free! That hurdle cleared, all I had to do was get there and then decide what to order. Ordering was the hard part. Ok, so I'm an indecisive, lactose-intolerant pizza-lover. Fine. Decisions, decisions. I actually didn't get a pizza, after all that! Other reviews said the pizza was alright but other things were better. So I tried the avocado, pancetta, and tomato focaccia, £5, lamb meatballs in tomato sauce, £5 (asked for it with grilled bread, which came free of charge!), and the artichoke and aubergine fritti, £6, accompanied by a Bethnal Pale Ale, £4.All that would have been too much for me, but I was with a friend so we shared the fritti. It was delicious - a small portion but just enough to leave you wanting more without getting bored of it. (We added chili flakes to the mayo sauce for zing.) The foccacia was lovely, and brimming with avocado, but would not have been enough on its own. The lamb meatballs were mouthwatering, but by the time I was done eating all three, I was really glad of that bread because damn were those babies salty! Delicious, but a bit too salty, I think. I even got to try the pizza, because that's what my friend ordered. Good tasting crust, a mix of crispy and chewy. She had the prosciutto cotto, tomato, mozzarella, artichoke, £11. That type of prosciutto is more like ham, and the 'tomato' was just sauce, not on top, while she reported the pizza to be under-cheesed. Oh well, that allowed me to take a bite. It was good, but not great. The decor is cool. Could be in NYC or LA but fits right in across from the Box Park. Service was ok but not exceptionally attentive.All in all, it was a nice meal in a nice place but not raveworthy. 3-stars ""A-OK"" fits perfectly."	yes it s me  the lactose intolerant pizza lover  ok  i m a conundrum  but places like pizza east help  i emailed in advance to ask if there was any lactose in the crust and if they could make a cheeseless pizza for me  and they emailed back not ten minutes later saying i d be safely lactose free  that hurdle cleared  all i had to do was get there and then decide what to order  ordering was the hard part  ok  so i m an indecisive  lactose intolerant pizza lover  fine  decisions  decisions  i actually didn t get a pizza  after all that  other reviews said the pizza was alright but other things were better  so i tried the avocado  pancetta  and tomato focaccia   5  lamb meatballs in tomato sauce   5  asked for it with grilled bread  which came free of charge    and the artichoke and aubergine fritti   6  accompanied by a bethnal pale ale   4 all that would have been too much for me  but i was with a friend so we shared the fritti  it was delicious   a small portion but just enough to leave you wanting more without getting bored of it   we added chili flakes to the mayo sauce for zing   the foccacia was lovely  and brimming with avocado  but would not have been enough on its own  the lamb meatballs were mouthwatering  but by the time i was done eating all three  i was really glad of that bread because damn were those babies salty  delicious  but a bit too salty  i think  i even got to try the pizza  because that s what my friend ordered  good tasting crust  a mix of crispy and chewy  she had the prosciutto cotto  tomato  mozzarella  artichoke   11  that type of prosciutto is more like ham  and the  tomato  was just sauce  not on top  while she reported the pizza to be under cheesed  oh well  that allowed me to take a bite  it was good  but not great  the decor is cool  could be in nyc or la but fits right in across from the box park  service was ok but not exceptionally attentive all in all  it was a nice meal in a nice place but not raveworthy  3 stars  a ok  fits perfectly

Guys slicing prosciutto. People doing this and that.If you dont like sitting at long communal tables this place aint for you.I loved their salted carmel. Went lovely with their tea.	i love this restaurant  i love this building  i love their food what an experience  this must have been an old factory of some sort but now it has a kitchen in the middle  guys slicing prosciutto  people doing this and that if you dont like sitting at long communal tables this place aint for you i loved their salted carmel  went lovely with their tea 
1157	5.0	Service was delightful but my roast chicken, guanciale, avocado and egg salad was even better. It sounded so good, all 3 of us ordered it! And there were clean plates all around. My only complaint is the old school desk style chairs picked my silk top, but I just swapped out for a ladder back and was happy again.	service was delightful but my roast chicken  guanciale  avocado and egg salad was even better  it sounded so good  all 3 of us ordered it  and there were clean plates all around  my only complaint is the old school desk style chairs picked my silk top  but i just swapped out for a ladder back and was happy again

As the place filled up we could barely hear ourselves across a four top table. The food ranged from very good to average; my rocket/fennel salad was outstanding, fresh and perfectly dressed. My lasagne was overcooked to just below burnt - enough that I didn't send it back, but I missed the great cheesiness it should have had if it wasn't so charred. Our apps were fine - garlic bread, calamari, and lamb meatballs. Nothing I'd be driven back to have again, but good for what they were. My friends enjoyed their pizzas. The service was hit or miss - it doesn't appear anyone is actually ""assigned"" to your table, so food gets delivered from different people, and you end up flagging down others to refill water, etc. - and each time it took a while, and several times we had to ask more than once. I think there are better options out there."	this gets a three star from me  but i would lean even toward a 2 5  it s hip  it s cool  it s crowded  mostly it s loud  as the place filled up we could barely hear ourselves across a four top table  the food ranged from very good to average  my rocket fennel salad was outstanding  fresh and perfectly dressed  my lasagne was overcooked to just below burnt   enough that i didn t send it back  but i missed the great cheesiness it should have had if it wasn t so charred  our apps were fine   garlic bread  calamari  and lamb meatballs  nothing i d be driven back to have again  but good for what they were  my friends enjoyed their pizzas  the service was hit or miss   it doesn t appear anyone is actually  assigned  to your table  so food gets delivered from different people  and you end up flagging down others to refill water  etc    and each time it took a while  and several times we had to ask more than once  i think there are better options out there 
1160	4.0	As I can only review on dessert and tea, not the pizza. On a late afternoon, after engorging myself from a food walking tour (filled with Poppies, Brick Lane Bagels, Curry, Cheese, Etc) we stopped here to end our tour for dessert. I was surprised we would be having dessert at a pizza joint in London. Huh? Well it actually was quite better then I thought it would be. We got a slice of the dark chocolate, salted caramel tart - served with whipped cream. It was quite decadent and the caramel was the perfect consistency. The atmosphere was also really cool - open bar areas, group seating and fun vibe. I would go back with a group of friends and recommend as a place for a quick hangout or drinks.	as i can only review on dessert and tea  not the pizza  on a late afternoon  after engorging myself from a food walking tour  filled with poppies  brick lane bagels  curry  cheese  etc  we stopped here to end our tour for dessert  i was surprised we would be having dessert at a pizza joint in london  huh  well it actually was quite better then i thought it would be  we got a slice of the dark chocolate  salted caramel tart   served with whipped cream  it was quite decadent and the caramel was the perfect consistency  the atmosphere was also really cool   open bar areas  group seating and fun vibe  i would go back with a group of friends and recommend as a place for a quick hangout or drinks

First of all, the warehouse style interior is at least three times as spacious and more tasteful than you'd imagine. Then take a look at the menu and be perplexed by the ""Vegetables"" category. Yes, there's an own section for vegetable dishes, not vegetarian pizzas, no, just vegetables. We ordered Roasted Broccoli with Chillies and Almonds, Roasted Fennel with Salad on Harrissa Lentils, and Garlic Bread. Both the Broccoli and the Fennel had a wonderful smoky flavour and were arranged wonderfully. I'll defenitely revisit and order Fennel again."	vegans of london   listen   don t be put off by this restaurant s name  they don t only serve cheesy pizza  i really didn t expect much from this place but was blown off my feet  first of all  the warehouse style interior is at least three times as spacious and more tasteful than you d imagine  then take a look at the menu and be perplexed by the  vegetables  category  yes  there s an own section for vegetable dishes  not vegetarian pizzas  no  just vegetables  we ordered roasted broccoli with chillies and almonds  roasted fennel with salad on harrissa lentils  and garlic bread  both the broccoli and the fennel had a wonderful smoky flavour and were arranged wonderfully  i ll defenitely revisit and order fennel again 
1164	4.0	Finally made it here. I had been meaning to try it for ages and never had the chance or, probably more accurately, made the effort. With a bit of New Year's resolve, managed to make a booking for Sat night.Firstly, take note of their table times. I was told that I could have my table for two on Sat night for 1.5 hours when I received the confirmation call for the booking. When I called to let them know I was running late, I was informed that the table would be held for 30 mins past the booking time and then released. Fair enough on both counts and appreciate the clear advance warning. If such policies exist, it's good to be told beforehand. We shared a lardo speck crostini to start and then had a pizza each. The crostini was quite good but a bit confusing. There were two pieces and I think one had the lardo and the other had the speck. It took me a little while to figure that out. My spicy sausage, mozzarella and tender stem broccoli pizza had good flavors. But I understand previous reviewers' comments about how the pizza is limp because it was. Limp and soggy in the middle. I still enjoyed it though. For desert, the salted caramel tart with the whipped cream on the side was luscious and just right - salty and chocolatey and the right amount of caramel. As my friend was saying, you don't go to Pizza East for the best pizza in London. You go because it's a Shoreditch institution and it's still there. Pizza East planted a flag on that corner before the first ironically bearded hipster dared to venture into the neighborhood. For that reason, I would probably go again if the opportunity presents itself. Also, when we left a mobile phone on our table, one of the servers chased us down the street in only his plaid shirt to return it to us. Now that's good service.	finally made it here  i had been meaning to try it for ages and never had the chance or  probably more accurately  made the effort  with a bit of new year s resolve  managed to make a booking for sat night firstly  take note of their table times  i was told that i could have my table for two on sat night for 1 5 hours when i received the confirmation call for the booking  when i called to let them know i was running late  i was informed that the table would be held for 30 mins past the booking time and then released  fair enough on both counts and appreciate the clear advance warning  if such policies exist  it s good to be told beforehand  we shared a lardo speck crostini to start and then had a pizza each  the crostini was quite good but a bit confusing  there were two pieces and i think one had the lardo and the other had the speck  it took me a little while to figure that out  my spicy sausage  mozzarella and tender stem broccoli pizza had good flavors  but i understand previous reviewers  comments about how the pizza is limp because it was  limp and soggy in the middle  i still enjoyed it though  for desert  the salted caramel tart with the whipped cream on the side was luscious and just right   salty and chocolatey and the right amount of caramel  as my friend was saying  you don t go to pizza east for the best pizza in london  you go because it s a shoreditch institution and it s still there  pizza east planted a flag on that corner before the first ironically bearded hipster dared to venture into the neighborhood  for that reason  i would probably go again if the opportunity presents itself  also  when we left a mobile phone on our table  one of the servers chased us down the street in only his plaid shirt to return it to us  now that s good service 
1165	4.0	So I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I went with 4 because of the great value and good service. Great value, you say? Well on Mondays for members it's all half-off... even the drinks! Our table of 6, with drinks, starters, and mains still came in under £100. Impressive. The service was a bit odd - we ended up being served by 3 different people, but lucky for us we got the best one first who marched me through each item on the menu, super quickly, marking the items that would be gluten free. Not only did she know her stuff, but she was very friendly about it. It was generally most of the menu, save the pizzas (not surprisingly!). We ordered the pork belly and chicken cacciatore as mains, which is where my 3 stars debate comes in. The pork belly was prepared at least in a way that I am not familiar with, which resulted in the skin turning into a greasy and difficult to chew substance reminiscent of a bad pork rind, and the meaty part was dry and lacking in flavor. I ate very little of the dish. The chicken was better, but was a very large portion of food on a plate a bit too small which made it difficult to navigate (but convenient, because we ended up splitting it). It was cooked well and the vegetables were tasty. The other guests had a mix of pizza and pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy their meals much better.The starters treated us well, though. We did a mix of meats and cheeses for the table, along with the olives and almonds and a butter lettuce salad. The meats and cheeses were a great deal - hefty portions and quality products (especially the burrata... mmmm...). All in all, a good stop, but I would recommend sticking to what they do best if you can - the pizza. It is named for it, after all.	so i was torn between 3 and 4 stars  but i went with 4 because of the great value and good service  great value  you say  well on mondays for members it s all half off    even the drinks  our table of 6  with drinks  starters  and mains still came in under  100  impressive  the service was a bit odd   we ended up being served by 3 different people  but lucky for us we got the best one first who marched me through each item on the menu  super quickly  marking the items that would be gluten free  not only did she know her stuff  but she was very friendly about it  it was generally most of the menu  save the pizzas  not surprisingly    we ordered the pork belly and chicken cacciatore as mains  which is where my 3 stars debate comes in  the pork belly was prepared at least in a way that i am not familiar with  which resulted in the skin turning into a greasy and difficult to chew substance reminiscent of a bad pork rind  and the meaty part was dry and lacking in flavor  i ate very little of the dish  the chicken was better  but was a very large portion of food on a plate a bit too small which made it difficult to navigate  but convenient  because we ended up splitting it   it was cooked well and the vegetables were tasty  the other guests had a mix of pizza and pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy their meals much better the starters treated us well  though  we did a mix of meats and cheeses for the table  along with the olives and almonds and a butter lettuce salad  the meats and cheeses were a great deal   hefty portions and quality products  especially the burrata    mmmm      all in all  a good stop  but i would recommend sticking to what they do best if you can   the pizza  it is named for it  after all

Set in the up and coming shoreditch area, on the lower floor of a creatively refurbished industrial age warehouse, Pizza East sports a youthful, trendy, loungy atmosphere in an industrial decoration. We decided to eat at the bar and enjoyed front-row tickets to the craftmanship of the pizzaioli. Pizza East takes the art of making pizza to the 21st century with class and style, while using outstanding gourmet ingredients to revolutionize the experience of a selection of classic pizzas.

1169	4.0	In Pizza East I've found my go to Sunday brunch spot in London, a conclusion I arrived at after noshing here two Sundays in a row. Their pizzas are thin crust with a thick doughy edge - not consistent with an Italian style - but tasty to be sure. And they're good for sharing. Our buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pie was heavily sauced which is great if you're into that (I am.) The sauce may be slightly too sweet and pasty and I could have used more basil, but overall the pizza's delicious.The butter lettuce salad with avocado was a great complement to the pizza but it needed more seasoning and some acid (a squeeze of lemon could've done a lot for it.)We got the lamb meatballs but between them and the pizza we had two competing red sauces so I would not recommend ordering these two together. Once again, not a traditional Italian meatball but instead, a Mediterranean influenced one using lamb and other spices.Ambiance wise, the space is a warm one.They've transformed an industrial warehouse (lots of concrete) with low ceilings into a very cosy, inviting place. In the loos, with their exposed copper pipes and worn wood stall doors, you really sense you're in a building that was once something very different. The hand cream near the soap is an especially nice surprise for dry, chapped winter hands.During Sunday afternoon service the crowd was very mixed: couples, couples with kids, larger groups - my kind of place.Getting a table for two at 13:00 on Sunday hasn't been a problem (read: no wait.)I'd take Pizza East over Story Deli (just a block away on Redchurch) any day.	in pizza east i ve found my go to sunday brunch spot in london  a conclusion i arrived at after noshing here two sundays in a row  their pizzas are thin crust with a thick doughy edge   not consistent with an italian style   but tasty to be sure  and they re good for sharing  our buffalo mozzarella  tomato  basil pie was heavily sauced which is great if you re into that  i am   the sauce may be slightly too sweet and pasty and i could have used more basil  but overall the pizza s delicious the butter lettuce salad with avocado was a great complement to the pizza but it needed more seasoning and some acid  a squeeze of lemon could ve done a lot for it  we got the lamb meatballs but between them and the pizza we had two competing red sauces so i would not recommend ordering these two together  once again  not a traditional italian meatball but instead  a mediterranean influenced one using lamb and other spices ambiance wise  the space is a warm one they ve transformed an industrial warehouse  lots of concrete  with low ceilings into a very cosy  inviting place  in the loos  with their exposed copper pipes and worn wood stall doors  you really sense you re in a building that was once something very different  the hand cream near the soap is an especially nice surprise for dry  chapped winter hands during sunday afternoon service the crowd was very mixed  couples  couples with kids  larger groups   my kind of place getting a table for two at 13 00 on sunday hasn t been a problem  read  no wait  i d take pizza east over story deli  just a block away on redchurch  any day 
1170	4.0	Came here after getting after drinks munchies. Great atmosphere and eating environment. Serving, guess what? Pizzas (clue is in the name), along with salads, etc.  I opted for a pizza with broccoli on, in order for me feel better for having pizza!!  This was rather tasty. Pizza was of a good size. Enough to share really. Also had garlic bread which was pretty fantastic as garlic bread goes. Staff were patient and friendly.  Come closing time they gave us a nudge to get our dessert order in before they closed the kitchen.  Managed to squeeze in a portion of their donuts which were lovely and warm. Crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Although last to leave, the staff did not rush us in anyway. Would definitely swing by again.	came here after getting after drinks munchies  great atmosphere and eating environment  serving  guess what  pizzas  clue is in the name   along with salads  etc   i opted for a pizza with broccoli on  in order for me feel better for having pizza    this was rather tasty  pizza was of a good size  enough to share really  also had garlic bread which was pretty fantastic as garlic bread goes  staff were patient and friendly   come closing time they gave us a nudge to get our dessert order in before they closed the kitchen   managed to squeeze in a portion of their donuts which were lovely and warm  crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside   although last to leave  the staff did not rush us in anyway  would definitely swing by again 
1171	4.0	We've been in town almost three weeks now and needed to get our pizza fix.  Pizza East has been pretty solid for us on our previous visits and that's where we went.  Thankfully we made a booking for lunch this weekend.  We've ended up dining at the bar on previous walk ins.  If you want a table, and not the bar or communal table seats, I'm fairly sure a booking is a must.PE always seems to be packed and buzzing.  Our server took our drink order for a round of Guinness and a bottle of fizzy water (trying to get better with these terms).  When she arrived shortly after with our drinks, we were ready to eat.  Rocket salad and olives to start.  Buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza for the lady and Salami (subbed for the anchovies), tomato, olive, caper, oregano and mozz pizza for me.The salad was great and a nice, light start.  It would have benefited greatly from a splash of balsamic vinegar though.  The almonds that came with the olives were outstanding.  Our pizzas came out just as we finished up our starters.  My wife's pizza was just as she likes it, light on the cheese.  I had a generous helping of salami on my pie and made short work of it.  Where Pizza East nails it for me is the crust, crunchy and yet still chewy.  A bit thin in the middle perhaps, but pretty, pretty, pretty good.  We devoured them both in no time.  A decent eater will have no problem taking down an entire pie.  No dessert for us.  Solid pizzas at PE, yet I continue my search for London's best pie.	we ve been in town almost three weeks now and needed to get our pizza fix   pizza east has been pretty solid for us on our previous visits and that s where we went   thankfully we made a booking for lunch this weekend   we ve ended up dining at the bar on previous walk ins   if you want a table  and not the bar or communal table seats  i m fairly sure a booking is a must pe always seems to be packed and buzzing   our server took our drink order for a round of guinness and a bottle of fizzy water  trying to get better with these terms    when she arrived shortly after with our drinks  we were ready to eat   rocket salad and olives to start   buffalo mozzarella  tomato and basil pizza for the lady and salami  subbed for the anchovies   tomato  olive  caper  oregano and mozz pizza for me the salad was great and a nice  light start   it would have benefited greatly from a splash of balsamic vinegar though   the almonds that came with the olives were outstanding   our pizzas came out just as we finished up our starters   my wife s pizza was just as she likes it  light on the cheese   i had a generous helping of salami on my pie and made short work of it   where pizza east nails it for me is the crust  crunchy and yet still chewy   a bit thin in the middle perhaps  but pretty  pretty  pretty good   we devoured them both in no time   a decent eater will have no problem taking down an entire pie   no dessert for us   solid pizzas at pe  yet i continue my search for london s best pie 
1172	4.0	I've been to Pizza East on a few occasions and I must admit they're consistent in quality of pizza and the speed of service. The place is usually packed, but the food arrives super quick. I love the industrial decor, although some tables may be a little bit too dark (try to book a table by a window, which are bright and you can observe the quirky hipsters flocking into Box Park. My favourite pizza is the one with aubergine, smoked mozarella and pesto. It's full of flavours which complement themselves. The pizza is really juicy, but crispy where it needs to be crispy. Apart from pizzas there are many other options, like salads, meet and veg.They also have an interesting selection of cocktails. Last time I went for Picante de la casa - Gran Centenario Plata, lime, agave, chilli, coriander. If you like savoury/spicy cocktails, you'll love it!I've never tried their desserts until last week. And since I'm a cheese monster, I went for (more of greed than of hunger) a cheese board , which I regretted 5 minutes later when I saw the cases and gelatos of my companions coming in. The cheeses weren't fresh, in some cased I would even say they were on a  borderline. But the portion is generous, 2 people easily can share it.	i ve been to pizza east on a few occasions and i must admit they re consistent in quality of pizza and the speed of service  the place is usually packed  but the food arrives super quick  i love the industrial decor  although some tables may be a little bit too dark  try to book a table by a window  which are bright and you can observe the quirky hipsters flocking into box park  my favourite pizza is the one with aubergine  smoked mozarella and pesto  it s full of flavours which complement themselves  the pizza is really juicy  but crispy where it needs to be crispy  apart from pizzas there are many other options  like salads  meet and veg they also have an interesting selection of cocktails  last time i went for picante de la casa   gran centenario plata  lime  agave  chilli  coriander  if you like savoury spicy cocktails  you ll love it i ve never tried their desserts until last week  and since i m a cheese monster  i went for  more of greed than of hunger  a cheese board   which i regretted 5 minutes later when i saw the cases and gelatos of my companions coming in  the cheeses weren t fresh  in some cased i would even say they were on a  borderline  but the portion is generous  2 people easily can share it 
1173	3.0	Pizza East is most definitely not worthy of 5 stars. Four stars would be pushing it but three stars is too little, so I've settled on 3.5 stars.Service was friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was packed. The restaurant is spread over two floors and I was happy to find out that our reserved table was on the upper floor, next to the bar. As noted by another reviewer, this is the best place to sit. I think I would have had a terrible time had we been seated downstairs because it was incredibly packed and very, very loud. So loud that we would have not been able to have a conversation while seated at a table.The food here is not spectacular and the pizza is definitely not the best in London. Yes, it's good but I don't think I would make a return visit unless, maybe, if I were starving and in the area.Lamb meatballs - they were OK but they had a strange aftertaste and the tomato sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.Salami pizza - way, way, way too much salami. They could have used half the amount of salami and it still would have been too much. It overpowered the pizza completely and I made a mess of my plate by picking 75% of it off. The base in the middle was soggy and the crust was nothing special. It almost tasted a bit cornmealy like the pizza at Otto. The positive thing about the pizza was that it was sliced so I did not need to whip out the pizza cutter I had stashed in my handbag.Mac n' cheese - the one time a dish in this country requires cheddar cheese, it doesn't contain it. I liked the mac n' cheese more than my husband but I don't think I'd order it again. Too much fat for not that great of a taste.Salted caramel dessert thingy - I had no desire to order this dessert as the name was very off-putting. Salt, chocolate, and caramel. No thanks. We ordered it anyway based on the rave reviews and it was the best part of the meal. The salt was spindled on top of the chocolate layer and wasn't overpowering.Santa Maria Pizzeria in Ealing and Saporitalia just around the corner have better pizza, in my humble opinion.	pizza east is most definitely not worthy of 5 stars  four stars would be pushing it but three stars is too little  so i ve settled on 3 5 stars service was friendly and attentive even though the restaurant was packed  the restaurant is spread over two floors and i was happy to find out that our reserved table was on the upper floor  next to the bar  as noted by another reviewer  this is the best place to sit  i think i would have had a terrible time had we been seated downstairs because it was incredibly packed and very  very loud  so loud that we would have not been able to have a conversation while seated at a table the food here is not spectacular and the pizza is definitely not the best in london  yes  it s good but i don t think i would make a return visit unless  maybe  if i were starving and in the area lamb meatballs   they were ok but they had a strange aftertaste and the tomato sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking salami pizza   way  way  way too much salami  they could have used half the amount of salami and it still would have been too much  it overpowered the pizza completely and i made a mess of my plate by picking 75  of it off  the base in the middle was soggy and the crust was nothing special  it almost tasted a bit cornmealy like the pizza at otto  the positive thing about the pizza was that it was sliced so i did not need to whip out the pizza cutter i had stashed in my handbag mac n  cheese   the one time a dish in this country requires cheddar cheese  it doesn t contain it  i liked the mac n  cheese more than my husband but i don t think i d order it again  too much fat for not that great of a taste salted caramel dessert thingy   i had no desire to order this dessert as the name was very off putting  salt  chocolate  and caramel  no thanks  we ordered it anyway based on the rave reviews and it was the best part of the meal  the salt was spindled on top of the chocolate layer and wasn t overpowering santa maria pizzeria in ealing and saporitalia just around the corner have better pizza  in my humble opinion

When we finally ordered, the food came out quite quickly. Pizzas were nice, but nothing special.I would avoid this place based on mediocre food and terrible service.	we arrived here on sunday around 3ish to a fairly empty restaurant  we were seated straight away and given menus  but it took over 20 minutes for our orders to be taken  when we finally ordered  the food came out quite quickly  pizzas were nice  but nothing special i would avoid this place based on mediocre food and terrible service

You could even wait in another pub nearby, if the list is long. The decor is lovely and you could easily fit a group. I just have to say that the pizza is really not the best. It's alright. Better than average. But I wouldn't wait for a table there in the future.	the best thing about pizza east is its size and the easy queuing system  give them your name  grab a drink  and wait for them to contact you  you could even wait in another pub nearby  if the list is long  the decor is lovely and you could easily fit a group  i just have to say that the pizza is really not the best  it s alright  better than average  but i wouldn t wait for a table there in the future

A little expensive and not the best pizza ever (crust kind of thinning/sogging from the weight of the pizza) so I had to deduct a star.	fun vibe and fun pizzas with high quality toppings  the pie with buratta and parma ham was delicious   because anything with buratta and parma ham is delicious  a little expensive and not the best pizza ever  crust kind of thinning sogging from the weight of the pizza  so i had to deduct a star

We shared the Sweet Potato & Quinoa and Prawns and avocado small plates which were a lovely start to the meal.For the main courses, we shared the Nduja pizza and the 'Caesar' salad which was surprisingly the best I've ever tasted in any restaurant. The wine and service were also great.Brilliant place for group dinners.	absolutely loved this place  ordered a variety of dishes  we shared the sweet potato   quinoa and prawns and avocado small plates which were a lovely start to the meal for the main courses  we shared the nduja pizza and the  caesar  salad which was surprisingly the best i ve ever tasted in any restaurant  the wine and service were also great brilliant place for group dinners

We were then invited to the table and had our orders taken. We both took the cheese and black truffle pizza. Tasty, maybe a bit soggy. It did not take too long for the pizza to come, around 15 min.The prices are decent for the location. The pizza is around £12-15. The service was great as well, all the waiters were very nice to us.I definitely reccomend this place!	went there during the week  wasnt too busy  the place is huge  when we entered  we were asked if we want to leave our coats to the cloakroom which i found nice  we were then invited to the table and had our orders taken  we both took the cheese and black truffle pizza  tasty  maybe a bit soggy  it did not take too long for the pizza to come  around 15 min the prices are decent for the location  the pizza is around  12 15  the service was great as well  all the waiters were very nice to us i definitely reccomend this place 
1180	5.0	Very cool place here in Shoreditch. Enormous location, cool setup looking out onto the Boxpark - industrial feel - good music - great atmosphere!Pizza here was good, if slightly inconsistently cooked. Crust was amazing on the outside, good flavor, well cooked in a hot pizza oven. But, it was a bit soggy in the middle, and required a little bit of silverware. Toppings were good, though not exactly what they stated. Prosciutto was a little too much like ham, and the spicy sausage was less than spicy. Overall though, a great pizza.Very quick pizza service - really happy with that aspect of it. And it seemed as though there was always a server nearby when needed. It was towards the end of the evening, but still - very quick service for any time of day.Excellent place for groups, be prepared for the pizzas coming out super fast, and enjoy the cool atmosphere!	very cool place here in shoreditch  enormous location  cool setup looking out onto the boxpark   industrial feel   good music   great atmosphere pizza here was good  if slightly inconsistently cooked  crust was amazing on the outside  good flavor  well cooked in a hot pizza oven  but  it was a bit soggy in the middle  and required a little bit of silverware  toppings were good  though not exactly what they stated  prosciutto was a little too much like ham  and the spicy sausage was less than spicy  overall though  a great pizza very quick pizza service   really happy with that aspect of it  and it seemed as though there was always a server nearby when needed  it was towards the end of the evening  but still   very quick service for any time of day excellent place for groups  be prepared for the pizzas coming out super fast  and enjoy the cool atmosphere

1185	3.0	Really good pizza. Came for lunch with 8 other friends, it's quite a chilled place and we got a table easily enough but sometimes I think it gets full pretty quickly at lunch / evenings. My pizza was incredible, veal meatballs, prosciutto and cream, though there was one bite which made me feel really sick. Not sure what was on it but it wasn't good. Or it was just me. Service is ok, they forgot to veganise one of my friends pizzas (no cheese if you're interested) and another friends margarita (pizza not drink, spelling may be off here) came 5 minutes after the rest of ours (other than vegan pizza the second). Finally, one friend paid upfront for his food as he had to get back to the office. They 'forgot' to take his food off the bill. That's why I'm throwing three stars at it. Nice place. Good pizza. Good beer. But one bad mouthful and some bitty service knocks it down.	really good pizza  came for lunch with 8 other friends  it s quite a chilled place and we got a table easily enough but sometimes i think it gets full pretty quickly at lunch   evenings  my pizza was incredible  veal meatballs  prosciutto and cream  though there was one bite which made me feel really sick  not sure what was on it but it wasn t good  or it was just me  service is ok  they forgot to veganise one of my friends pizzas  no cheese if you re interested  and another friends margarita  pizza not drink  spelling may be off here  came 5 minutes after the rest of ours  other than vegan pizza the second   finally  one friend paid upfront for his food as he had to get back to the office  they  forgot  to take his food off the bill  that s why i m throwing three stars at it  nice place  good pizza  good beer  but one bad mouthful and some bitty service knocks it down

1187	2.0	So, I've been past this place several times but never wanted to go in and I'll tell you why...This is a big place and reminds me of the warehouse style bbq joints in the States - not good. Industrial style everywhere. The pizza's are thin crust and tasty but overpriced. The house wine tasted like the fumes you cough up when you get a bit choked on your food. Don't order the house white.I didn't want to enter previously because this place is always crawling with Hipsters. No, not just a few dotted around. I mean crawling with them!The pizza menu is designed just for the Hipster brigade - wanna be quirky combos - they do not even have just mushroom pizza's, although will leave an item off or add one if you prefer, provided it is available.The music here is loud, so be prepared to shout across to your mates (as we had to do) to conversate. On hindsight, I would have preferred sitting at the counter but my friend didn't think to ask for that area.The pizza filled a crack and my mate ordered a dessert - I passed because nothing looked all that fab and I was growing weary of the shouting all around, Hipster's banging around because they don't know how to sit still and eat their food without wanting to be seen.The icing on the cake was, as we were leaving, they had bouncers on the door carding people wanting to get in.

1188	4.0	I needed to grab a quick bite to eat before my gig at the Comedy Cafe and been meaning to try this place.  I got there around 7ish and sat up at the bar without a wait.  I ordered the house wine (that comes out of a tap!) and ordered the mushroom pizza straight away.  I think the service is always a little bit more attentive when you're eating by yourself and thought everything was super prompt.  My pizza came out quickly and it was pretty good.  I tried not to fill myself up with the crust in case I didn't finish it but I ended up going back and dipping it into the chili oil because it was that good.  I was in and out in 30 minutes so service can be really quick if you want it to be - and glad I stopped in there to eat instead of grabbing something to eat at the bedroom bar.	i needed to grab a quick bite to eat before my gig at the comedy cafe and been meaning to try this place   i got there around 7ish and sat up at the bar without a wait   i ordered the house wine  that comes out of a tap   and ordered the mushroom pizza straight away   i think the service is always a little bit more attentive when you re eating by yourself and thought everything was super prompt   my pizza came out quickly and it was pretty good   i tried not to fill myself up with the crust in case i didn t finish it but i ended up going back and dipping it into the chili oil because it was that good   i was in and out in 30 minutes so service can be really quick if you want it to be   and glad i stopped in there to eat instead of grabbing something to eat at the bedroom bar 
1189	2.0	Pizza East is in a converted Tea Factory/warehouse right in the heart of Shoreditch - sweet historical building. The location is great and really easy to get to, right next to Shoreditch High Street Station.The restaurant is great for groups - they have lots of large tables and the atmosphere there is catered towards groups.  It's also quite loud inside, especially on a Friday or Saturday night so prepare to shout to hear your friends.I found the pizza itself sub-par.  Definitely doesn't match the other Pizza places in London such as Pizza Oregano in Angel or Sweet Thursday in De Beauvoir, however, this is a different area I guess - I just wouldn't come here if I was in Shoreditch, simply because the pizza isn't that good.  I found the portion sizes a bit on the small side and it's quite salty.I'd come here if I wanted a casual group dinner place that isn't that expensive in Shoreditch but don't come here for amazing pizza.	pizza east is in a converted tea factory warehouse right in the heart of shoreditch   sweet historical building  the location is great and really easy to get to  right next to shoreditch high street station the restaurant is great for groups   they have lots of large tables and the atmosphere there is catered towards groups   it s also quite loud inside  especially on a friday or saturday night so prepare to shout to hear your friends i found the pizza itself sub par   definitely doesn t match the other pizza places in london such as pizza oregano in angel or sweet thursday in de beauvoir  however  this is a different area i guess   i just wouldn t come here if i was in shoreditch  simply because the pizza isn t that good   i found the portion sizes a bit on the small side and it s quite salty i d come here if i wanted a casual group dinner place that isn t that expensive in shoreditch but don t come here for amazing pizza 
1190	3.0	I'd heard of Pizza East in the area but I didn't realise it was in the Tea Building - very cool location and it's a great looking restaurant, good for groups and if you want to impress someone with somewhere a bit cool (although of course it's now too well known actually to be cool)Service was generally prompt and friendly. The food is also pretty good - I liked the little arancini we had to start and they certainly know how to make good pizza although I wasn't blown away. It's pretty expensive and you could probably find pizza of equal calibere a few pounds cheaper somewhere else. However, if you're around Shoreditch and craving some dough, this would be one of the best places to come.	i d heard of pizza east in the area but i didn t realise it was in the tea building   very cool location and it s a great looking restaurant  good for groups and if you want to impress someone with somewhere a bit cool  although of course it s now too well known actually to be cool service was generally prompt and friendly  the food is also pretty good   i liked the little arancini we had to start and they certainly know how to make good pizza although i wasn t blown away  it s pretty expensive and you could probably find pizza of equal calibere a few pounds cheaper somewhere else  however  if you re around shoreditch and craving some dough  this would be one of the best places to come 
1191	4.0	I thought the menu was reasonably priced with pizzas from £8 and a good range of antipasti ranging from Garlic bread for £3 to Fritto misto for £8. There are a few salad choices and if you don't fancy a pizza, there are 5 or 6 dishes cooked in the wood oven like Mac 'n' cheese (£8), Lamb shoulder with salsa verde (£14) and Salt baked salmon with aioli (£16).We were definitely in a pizza mood, we had been ever since we got back from Italy so Antonia had the Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza (£8) with some prosciutto cotto added (+£1.50) and I went for the Pork belly, tomato, fontina, mushroom pizza (£11). Both were tasty and surprisingly filling - we probably could have shared one with a couple of antipasti dishes, although I thought Antonia's was a little stingy on the mozzarella front considering that was the main ingredient. My pork belly was delicious, maybe a touch dry but with nice crispy chunks of crackling mixed in.We were pretty impressed with Pizza East Shoreditch. They use good quality ingredients, cook them simply and authentically and the impressive space certainly adds to the experience.	i thought the menu was reasonably priced with pizzas from  8 and a good range of antipasti ranging from garlic bread for  3 to fritto misto for  8  there are a few salad choices and if you don t fancy a pizza  there are 5 or 6 dishes cooked in the wood oven like mac  n  cheese   8   lamb shoulder with salsa verde   14  and salt baked salmon with aioli   16  we were definitely in a pizza mood  we had been ever since we got back from italy so antonia had the buffalo mozzarella  tomato  basil pizza   8  with some prosciutto cotto added    1 50  and i went for the pork belly  tomato  fontina  mushroom pizza   11   both were tasty and surprisingly filling   we probably could have shared one with a couple of antipasti dishes  although i thought antonia s was a little stingy on the mozzarella front considering that was the main ingredient  my pork belly was delicious  maybe a touch dry but with nice crispy chunks of crackling mixed in we were pretty impressed with pizza east shoreditch  they use good quality ingredients  cook them simply and authentically and the impressive space certainly adds to the experience 
1192	4.0	Tasty pizza with toppings that you don't see every day, they change the menu fairly often too. I had a ricotta and Parma ham one that was absolutely delicious. I've been here for both dates and work lunches, it would be good for big groups too. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, but dim lightly makes it quite romantic too.It is located in a converted warehouse with original exposed brick and big windows - it's a really cool venue. Located just across the road from shoreditch high street overground which is handy, close to other bars for drinks after too.It makes for an expensive lunch but a reasonably priced evening meal. I would definitely recommend pizza East.	tasty pizza with toppings that you don t see every day  they change the menu fairly often too  i had a ricotta and parma ham one that was absolutely delicious  i ve been here for both dates and work lunches  it would be good for big groups too  the atmosphere is relaxed and fun  but dim lightly makes it quite romantic too it is located in a converted warehouse with original exposed brick and big windows   it s a really cool venue  located just across the road from shoreditch high street overground which is handy  close to other bars for drinks after too it makes for an expensive lunch but a reasonably priced evening meal  i would definitely recommend pizza east

1198	5.0	Pizza East's fare is balanced--not authentic Italian but not the cheesy-overloaded American type either. It is somewhere in between. The bread's thin with a good crust on it. And the toppings don't overpower the flavor of the pie itself. Everything is subtle. The menu comprises of 10 or so pizzas (it is small), but each one is executed well. I should know--I work very close by on Shoreditch High Street and Pizza East is our goto place for all welcome lunches with new team members. So I've probably had everything on the menu. My absolute favorite, not just here but in all of London, is the heritage potato pizza. Not a conventional choice but it does hit the spot. It is not on the menu always, but I never order anything else if it is. Among the regulars, the veal meatballs, prosciutto, and cream pizza comes a close second. Topped with chilli oil, this one makes for a lovely lunch. Wash it all down with elderflower-lemon juice and you'll go back a happy chappy.	pizza east s fare is balanced  not authentic italian but not the cheesy overloaded american type either  it is somewhere in between  the bread s thin with a good crust on it  and the toppings don t overpower the flavor of the pie itself  everything is subtle  the menu comprises of 10 or so pizzas  it is small   but each one is executed well  i should know  i work very close by on shoreditch high street and pizza east is our goto place for all welcome lunches with new team members  so i ve probably had everything on the menu  my absolute favorite  not just here but in all of london  is the heritage potato pizza  not a conventional choice but it does hit the spot  it is not on the menu always  but i never order anything else if it is  among the regulars  the veal meatballs  prosciutto  and cream pizza comes a close second  topped with chilli oil  this one makes for a lovely lunch  wash it all down with elderflower lemon juice and you ll go back a happy chappy 
1199	3.0	I absolutely love pizza. But I do not absolutely love Pizza East.Why not?Well, although you can tell the ingredients are pretty fresh and decent, it suffers massively from being a hipster shoreditch place.What does that mean? Well, how about:1. It means the menu has lots of weird stuff. Great if you want to look cool. Not so great if you just want a nice simple pizza (though they were happy to accommodate my request for a simple pizza that wasn't on the menu)2. Queues to get in. Hipsters seem to love queuing up to get into places. Perhaps this somehow makes the food nicer for them, but for me it just means I am wasting time.3. It's got a great atmosphere for a bar but not so great if you just want a meal. It's kind of an event to go do Pizza East, but pizza is not really an event.Whilst the quality of pizza is a little better than say, Pizza Express or Ask, it's not so much better that you should go out of your way to come here, certainly not for the prices they charge.	i absolutely love pizza  but i do not absolutely love pizza east why not well  although you can tell the ingredients are pretty fresh and decent  it suffers massively from being a hipster shoreditch place what does that mean  well  how about 1  it means the menu has lots of weird stuff  great if you want to look cool  not so great if you just want a nice simple pizza  though they were happy to accommodate my request for a simple pizza that wasn t on the menu 2  queues to get in  hipsters seem to love queuing up to get into places  perhaps this somehow makes the food nicer for them  but for me it just means i am wasting time 3  it s got a great atmosphere for a bar but not so great if you just want a meal  it s kind of an event to go do pizza east  but pizza is not really an event whilst the quality of pizza is a little better than say  pizza express or ask  it s not so much better that you should go out of your way to come here  certainly not for the prices they charge 
1200	4.0	Shoreditch has famously distinct areas for amazing Vietnamese (lower Kingsland Rd) and Turkish food (Upper Kingsland Rd- The Dalston end)  and of course the plethora of South Asian curry houses a la Brick Lane, you're spoilt for choice. Late after a busy Sunday evening with blood sugar levels plummeting and cold whipping our  ears, we slinked lazily into Shoreditch sweet spot on the corner, in the crossroads of it all, Pizza East. The mystery of not really being able to see in or out gives it a touch of exclusivity (part of the Soho House Group) and privacy when you need it most, when snarfing a superbly stringy sizeable stone baked slice. It has a stark industrial charm, low lit and warm, rather inviting.They have a coat check in service which always wins me over, I don't understand why more establishments don't have it here. They almost forcibly strip you of your outdoor wear as soon as you step into a building in New York. So on a Sunday night about 8.45 they were still busy! Long communal dining tables packed with daters dating over casual Pizzas, but more obvious were 1st daters sending their pizza remnances back to be boxed to take home to no doubt eat the rest in piggish privacy. We got sat at the bar, where the remnants of pizza were marched in to be boxed in a carry away. They always look like they'll taste great but revived by a microwave never do. So Mama mia, I'm going to have to be controversial. I didn't order a Pizza. My friend said it was like taking someone for a Chinese and seeing them order omelette and chips. I don't particularly care for Chinese food as it goes. I did my usual and went against the norm and was pleasantly surprised with the small  Antipasti plates and sides and really although small, it was more than enough. Chicken livers came gently charred with tasty pinkness, on pillowy smooth Polenta and not as advertised, but thank you- full of flavourful pecorino punching through it and smattering of piquant tangy Salsa Calabrese dotted on the dish, de-lish! This with a side of Cavolo Nero, Cabbage if you wondered, I did ask and this was steamed to perfection dressed in Sicilian lemon and olive oil. Italians don't half dress well. Staff aplenty were beautifully brusque and informative Italians who were happy to educate me on cheeses and even brought me an off-the-menu ripe Tallegio. Lovely but lacking in balance it needed a bit of quince or dare I say without sounding a pleb, pickle.  So with the help of a few translators and my google app next arrived a very much appreciated side of Quince and as if I needed it, rosemary olive bread.

1201	2.0	I went to Pizza East as part of a birthday dinner a few weeks back, and while it's a super neat space with a really cool atmosphere, for the most part I found it to be overhyped and underwhelming. It's not that anything was particularly bad about my experience, but nothing blew me away, and certainly nothing demanded the large crowd of people who were also dining there, hence the two stars.With my group of friends, we ordered appetizers, pizzas and dessert, as well as several bottles of wine. We certainly enjoyed our company, but unfortunately it came with quite a price tag, maybe not out of line with nice restaurants in Soho, but definitely on the higher end for the Shoreditch area. Additionally, the service was pretty spotty, except at the end where we were hurried out of the restaurant to make room for another party (which it's always nice to be forewarned about). The location is pretty great though, right on the corner of Shoreditch High Street. The atmosphere, as I mentioned, is really cool, industrial and funky and certainly worthy of a cool meal. Unfortunately, I was also kind of underwhelmed by my pizza, which was kind of Roman-style but with a weird variety of options for toppings and generally not as tasty as I prefer. All in all, it's a nice place, I'm glad I had a great time with friends there, but its's not quite enough to draw me back. Plenty of other new and/or better places in the area to enjoy.	i went to pizza east as part of a birthday dinner a few weeks back  and while it s a super neat space with a really cool atmosphere  for the most part i found it to be overhyped and underwhelming  it s not that anything was particularly bad about my experience  but nothing blew me away  and certainly nothing demanded the large crowd of people who were also dining there  hence the two stars with my group of friends  we ordered appetizers  pizzas and dessert  as well as several bottles of wine  we certainly enjoyed our company  but unfortunately it came with quite a price tag  maybe not out of line with nice restaurants in soho  but definitely on the higher end for the shoreditch area  additionally  the service was pretty spotty  except at the end where we were hurried out of the restaurant to make room for another party  which it s always nice to be forewarned about   the location is pretty great though  right on the corner of shoreditch high street  the atmosphere  as i mentioned  is really cool  industrial and funky and certainly worthy of a cool meal  unfortunately  i was also kind of underwhelmed by my pizza  which was kind of roman style but with a weird variety of options for toppings and generally not as tasty as i prefer  all in all  it s a nice place  i m glad i had a great time with friends there  but its s not quite enough to draw me back  plenty of other new and or better places in the area to enjoy 
1202	3.0	Having had a really good meal at Pizza East on Portobello Road a few years ago, I was really excited to go again. As it was late on a Thursday night we did have a small wait for a table - but we filled this time with ordering wine and a DELICIOUS platter of cold Italian meats and a creamy ball of Burrata. We were then sat on the bar overlooking the open kitchen, which was lovely but I get distracted very easily so it wasn't such good news for my boyfriend!I was sad to see that the menu had become a bit less exciting - they seem to have become more like other pizza joints, whereas when I went last time they had a really creative menu. Anyway, I opted for a cream based pizza with veal meatballs - which sounded amazing on paper but when it came it was less so. The base was flavourless and the meat was far too salty! My boyfriend had a better experience with parma ham and rocket. I wish I had chosen that one! All in all it's still a great place - I expect I just chose badly. The starter was lovely and the service very good.	having had a really good meal at pizza east on portobello road a few years ago  i was really excited to go again  as it was late on a thursday night we did have a small wait for a table   but we filled this time with ordering wine and a delicious platter of cold italian meats and a creamy ball of burrata  we were then sat on the bar overlooking the open kitchen  which was lovely but i get distracted very easily so it wasn t such good news for my boyfriend i was sad to see that the menu had become a bit less exciting   they seem to have become more like other pizza joints  whereas when i went last time they had a really creative menu  anyway  i opted for a cream based pizza with veal meatballs   which sounded amazing on paper but when it came it was less so  the base was flavourless and the meat was far too salty  my boyfriend had a better experience with parma ham and rocket  i wish i had chosen that one  all in all it s still a great place   i expect i just chose badly  the starter was lovely and the service very good 
1203	4.0	Great service! Went in on a Friday night and you could tell they were slammed, but we only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The wait staff was running around but were still very attentive/ They had an appetizer with balsamic and parma - it was some of the best food I've ever eaten. And of course, I had to try the pork belly pizza - the pork belly itself was awesome, perfectly crisp and flavored nicely - though it was a little hard to eat with the pizza since the chunks were so big. But I didn't mind - it was pretty amazing. Everyone in Shoreditch recommends Pizza East for a reason.

1204	4.0	The venue itself is great. Spacious and industrial and does feel like somewhere in Soho New York with the bare brick walls, overhead air conditioning ducts and warehouse vibe. It's definitely London though, in the Tea building, a large warehouse industrial building dating from around the 1930's on the corner of Shoreditch high St.  We should have more restaurants like this here.The pizzas are good here but not the ultimate, in my opinion, good chewy base but perhaps too much crust to topping ratio.In fact, I have discovered that the other dishes are more the standout.A starter of fried artichokes with lemon was very good.I opted for Sunday roast lunch. Choice of pork belly, roast rib of beef or chicken. I had the roast pork belly. The portion was huge. Pork was excellent with very crisp crackling and fennel flavour. Crispy roast potatoes, carrots, fennel, shallots and a jug of perfect gravy that tasted like the real deal (root veg, wine, deglazed meat juices Mmmm) and apple sauce. A side of sprouting brocoli was a perfect green accompaniment. No room for desert after that.Service is friendly, on the ball but laid back and unobtrusive...a sense that someone is running a smoothly run machine.Get there early for Sunday brunch / lunch. At 12:30 it was quite empty. By 2pm it was packed with crowds waiting but there was no sense of being rushed at all. Plus points for that.	the venue itself is great  spacious and industrial and does feel like somewhere in soho new york with the bare brick walls  overhead air conditioning ducts and warehouse vibe  it s definitely london though  in the tea building  a large warehouse industrial building dating from around the 1930 s on the corner of shoreditch high st   we should have more restaurants like this here the pizzas are good here but not the ultimate  in my opinion  good chewy base but perhaps too much crust to topping ratio in fact  i have discovered that the other dishes are more the standout a starter of fried artichokes with lemon was very good i opted for sunday roast lunch  choice of pork belly  roast rib of beef or chicken  i had the roast pork belly  the portion was huge  pork was excellent with very crisp crackling and fennel flavour  crispy roast potatoes  carrots  fennel  shallots and a jug of perfect gravy that tasted like the real deal  root veg  wine  deglazed meat juices mmmm  and apple sauce  a side of sprouting brocoli was a perfect green accompaniment  no room for desert after that service is friendly  on the ball but laid back and unobtrusive   a sense that someone is running a smoothly run machine get there early for sunday brunch   lunch  at 12 30 it was quite empty  by 2pm it was packed with crowds waiting but there was no sense of being rushed at all  plus points for that 
1205	4.0	I really enjoyed my experience here.  I've passed by this establishment many of times and I'm glad I finally tried it out.  Firstly, the location is stellar - right on Shoreditch High Street, in the midst of all the buzz and excitement.  The decor is casual but fun and the restaurant is quite large, able to attend to many clients (thus a great place for a group!).  I had the simple margarita pizza and it was incredible - sweet tomato sauce, not too much cheese (the perfect amount) and a thick, doughy crust.  It was delicious!  The service was speedy and efficient and the prices were more than reasonable.  I would absolutely come back to Pizza East!	i really enjoyed my experience here   i ve passed by this establishment many of times and i m glad i finally tried it out   firstly  the location is stellar   right on shoreditch high street  in the midst of all the buzz and excitement   the decor is casual but fun and the restaurant is quite large  able to attend to many clients  thus a great place for a group     i had the simple margarita pizza and it was incredible   sweet tomato sauce  not too much cheese  the perfect amount  and a thick  doughy crust   it was delicious   the service was speedy and efficient and the prices were more than reasonable   i would absolutely come back to pizza east 
1206	2.0	Located in the Tea Building, Pizza East is one of those places you'd imagine is all about gourmet pizzas, which are the best in town.In reality, it's no better or worse than a pizza you'd pick up from Pizza Express or Zizzi's. It's not bad, but it's not particularly memorable either and you were kinda hoping for there to be a 'Shoreditch' twist to give it that unique touch.And I'm really not a fan of any restaurant which has long tables (big enough to seat around 20-odd people), but then ends up sitting complete strangers next to each other. All kinds of awkward when you're not in a large group.Combined with a waitress who seemed like she'd rather be elsewhere on a Wednesday evening, I'm pretty sure it'd take a strong craving for pizza, combined with a non-functional Northern and Overground line before I return again.	located in the tea building  pizza east is one of those places you d imagine is all about gourmet pizzas  which are the best in town in reality  it s no better or worse than a pizza you d pick up from pizza express or zizzi s  it s not bad  but it s not particularly memorable either and you were kinda hoping for there to be a  shoreditch  twist to give it that unique touch and i m really not a fan of any restaurant which has long tables  big enough to seat around 20 odd people   but then ends up sitting complete strangers next to each other  all kinds of awkward when you re not in a large group combined with a waitress who seemed like she d rather be elsewhere on a wednesday evening  i m pretty sure it d take a strong craving for pizza  combined with a non functional northern and overground line before i return again 
1207	4.0	Went here tonight with two friends. Had 3 small plates tapas style - garlic bread which was so nice but so garlicky and buttery! Lamb meatballs which were delicious and not too heavy and mortadella which was a bigger portion than I expected. All in all pretty good, great service and nice atmosphere, though started to get really noisy as we were leaving.	went here tonight with two friends  had 3 small plates tapas style   garlic bread which was so nice but so garlicky and buttery  lamb meatballs which were delicious and not too heavy and mortadella which was a bigger portion than i expected  all in all pretty good  great service and nice atmosphere  though started to get really noisy as we were leaving 
1208	5.0	So I usually have at least one area for improvement whenever I have a meal at a restaurant, but I literally couldn't find anything negative to comment on here.  Went on a Sunday evening, started with the burrata/pea/prosciutto starter which was phenomenally creamy and tasty.  The main dish was the lamb meatball and prosciutto pizza.  Despite being a white pizza it was very light and not overly creamy.  The lamb was seasoned perfectly and the prosciutto was crisped like bacon (I've never had it that way before, but it won't be my last!)  My partner had the aubergine and basil pizza, my bite of which being delicious also.A Sunday evening probably isn't indicative of the atmosphere on a Friday or Saturday night, but our experience was fantastic!	so i usually have at least one area for improvement whenever i have a meal at a restaurant  but i literally couldn t find anything negative to comment on here   went on a sunday evening  started with the burrata pea prosciutto starter which was phenomenally creamy and tasty   the main dish was the lamb meatball and prosciutto pizza   despite being a white pizza it was very light and not overly creamy   the lamb was seasoned perfectly and the prosciutto was crisped like bacon  i ve never had it that way before  but it won t be my last    my partner had the aubergine and basil pizza  my bite of which being delicious also a sunday evening probably isn t indicative of the atmosphere on a friday or saturday night  but our experience was fantastic 
1209	4.0	We were served pizza with salami, tomato, mozzarella & chilli flakes along with Prosciutto cotto, wild mushroom & fontina cheese and of course the standard Buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil for the veggies. I cheekily tried all three and enjoyed the salami one most although some slices had more chilli on them than others! The crusts were super crispy while the base was still nice and doughy in the middle. Everything you could want from a pizza really. I'll definitely be returning!	we were served pizza with salami  tomato  mozzarella   chilli flakes along with prosciutto cotto  wild mushroom   fontina cheese and of course the standard buffalo mozzarella  tomato and basil for the veggies  i cheekily tried all three and enjoyed the salami one most although some slices had more chilli on them than others  the crusts were super crispy while the base was still nice and doughy in the middle  everything you could want from a pizza really  i ll definitely be returning 
1210	5.0	I can't fault anything with this restaurant! Popped in at 8 PM on a Thursday and it was a 30 minute wait for a table for two, no biggie, so we grabbed drinks and appetizers at the bar. The bartender made me an amazing mojito and we devoured a cheese/prosciutto plate in approximately five seconds, which was good because the table was actually ready far sooner than estimated. The burrata was soo creamy and delicious, and the prosciutto was perfection. Upon being seated and reviewing the menu I was taken by the veal meatball, prosciutto and cream pizza (you can never have too much prosciutto!) and my friend suggested we order some broccoli to be healthy, to which I rolled my eyes but acquiesced. The food was delivered within 10 minutes which was fantastic. Now let me tell you, this is probably the first broccoli I've ever enjoyed in my life (that wasn't smothered in cheese or ranch dressing). It was roasted with almonds, onions, and chilies- a shockingly delicious combination that I promptly devoured with enthusiasm. The pizza was equally delightful, with succulent meatballs and crispy prosciutto. We also tried the salted chocolate and caramel tart for dessert, which was a bit unnecessary after all that other great food, but still quite tasty. Overall, a delightful experience!	i can t fault anything with this restaurant  popped in at 8 pm on a thursday and it was a 30 minute wait for a table for two  no biggie  so we grabbed drinks and appetizers at the bar  the bartender made me an amazing mojito and we devoured a cheese prosciutto plate in approximately five seconds  which was good because the table was actually ready far sooner than estimated  the burrata was soo creamy and delicious  and the prosciutto was perfection  upon being seated and reviewing the menu i was taken by the veal meatball  prosciutto and cream pizza  you can never have too much prosciutto   and my friend suggested we order some broccoli to be healthy  to which i rolled my eyes but acquiesced  the food was delivered within 10 minutes which was fantastic  now let me tell you  this is probably the first broccoli i ve ever enjoyed in my life  that wasn t smothered in cheese or ranch dressing   it was roasted with almonds  onions  and chilies  a shockingly delicious combination that i promptly devoured with enthusiasm  the pizza was equally delightful  with succulent meatballs and crispy prosciutto  we also tried the salted chocolate and caramel tart for dessert  which was a bit unnecessary after all that other great food  but still quite tasty  overall  a delightful experience 
1211	4.0	Fabulous open space used in a funky way befitting hipster Shoreditch. Deconstructed and stressed wood and metal with touches of stylized glass chandeliers around an open bar area and casual seating make for a festive atmosphere day or night. While as the name says it is a pizza joint, it does offer a small variety of dishes such as mac n' cheese, as well as a selection of cold meats and cheeses from the chopping board behind the bar. Pizzas are the draw here and very good. I am disappointed their Arancini (rice balls) are no longer on the appetizer menu, but there are other tasty options that made me happy. You can't go wrong here, go!	fabulous open space used in a funky way befitting hipster shoreditch  deconstructed and stressed wood and metal with touches of stylized glass chandeliers around an open bar area and casual seating make for a festive atmosphere day or night  while as the name says it is a pizza joint  it does offer a small variety of dishes such as mac n  cheese  as well as a selection of cold meats and cheeses from the chopping board behind the bar  pizzas are the draw here and very good  i am disappointed their arancini  rice balls  are no longer on the appetizer menu  but there are other tasty options that made me happy  you can t go wrong here  go 
1212	4.0	Need to admit, it is good Italian pizza. However, it is a little pricey. Considering that quality Italian pizza is hard to find in London, this is a nice restaurant with nice atmosphere and good service. Similar places with good italian pizza usually lack one of the other features, like the atmosphere. So this is a place I would go to every now and then especially if I have guests.	need to admit  it is good italian pizza  however  it is a little pricey  considering that quality italian pizza is hard to find in london  this is a nice restaurant with nice atmosphere and good service  similar places with good italian pizza usually lack one of the other features  like the atmosphere  so this is a place i would go to every now and then especially if i have guests

Also the mac n cheese is my favorite there.  Just a good place to people watch and feel the vibe of the neighborhood, which is why I love to bring visitors there, some of whom didn't know much about this part of town.  To be honest, there are better pizza places out there but the vibe, the communal tables, the grungy interiors and the friendly and efficient service just pull me back time and time again.  And hey, the pizzas are not bad!  I always go late at night though, coz it seems quite impossible to get in at peak dining hours.  And what's better than brick oven pizza after rounds of drinks?	love the buzz  the noise and energy level  also the mac n cheese is my favorite there   just a good place to people watch and feel the vibe of the neighborhood  which is why i love to bring visitors there  some of whom didn t know much about this part of town   to be honest  there are better pizza places out there but the vibe  the communal tables  the grungy interiors and the friendly and efficient service just pull me back time and time again   and hey  the pizzas are not bad   i always go late at night though  coz it seems quite impossible to get in at peak dining hours   and what s better than brick oven pizza after rounds of drinks

Once seated prosecco on tap was fruity and fun but slightly overpriced £30 for 500mlWell dressed lamb speck; slightly disappointing beef cheeks and average arancini to start...Great cripsy based pizza with creamy burrata though really hit the spot.A good looking restaurant, with better then average pizza, but not rushing back.	sadly first impressions weren t great   poor seating waiting hosting style   plenty of free tables  but our party of 3 couldn t sit as a party of 2 and eat starters while waiting for our third   instead we had to stand around the bar which lacked decent nibble options watching the empty tables jealously  once seated prosecco on tap was fruity and fun but slightly overpriced  30 for 500mlwell dressed lamb speck  slightly disappointing beef cheeks and average arancini to start   great cripsy based pizza with creamy burrata though really hit the spot a good looking restaurant  with better then average pizza  but not rushing back

1217	4.0	Yum! After coming back from a week of gorging on late night pizza in Brooklyn and the lower East side of Manhattan - I was not looking forward to the late night kebab culture. i wanted yummy pizza and that doesn't happen with any of our delivery options.My partner and I tend to eat quite late sometimes during the week (9/9:30 PM) just due to our rather manic schedules - and though we live in Shoreditch, it is not always easy to find a place serving that late. But then there is Pizza East - Open til 11 on the weekdays and always ON - I was shocked by how many people are still buzzing there at 9:30 on a weekday.LIKESFood: I love burratta. There are plates of cheese. nuff' said. Oh, and the pizza is delicious. AND the salads - I'm not sure why butter lettuce is so good but I would recommend it as part of the avocado salad!Service - Quick and friendly - we had our food in less than 10 minutes and could decide whether to make it a slow or fast night depending on cocktails and wineBuzzing: There is nothing to pick up your mood sometimes than a lively atmosphere. My partner had already been with a group of friends on a weekend and had a great time, and this time it was just the two of us chowing down. Sometimes I dont' always feel like i'm in a city when i'm roaming around our London streets (what a snobbish NYC thing to say) - and that can be wonderful - but sometimes you just want the buzz of city life and you definitely get that vibe here	yum  after coming back from a week of gorging on late night pizza in brooklyn and the lower east side of manhattan   i was not looking forward to the late night kebab culture  i wanted yummy pizza and that doesn t happen with any of our delivery options my partner and i tend to eat quite late sometimes during the week  9 9 30 pm  just due to our rather manic schedules   and though we live in shoreditch  it is not always easy to find a place serving that late  but then there is pizza east   open til 11 on the weekdays and always on   i was shocked by how many people are still buzzing there at 9 30 on a weekday likesfood  i love burratta  there are plates of cheese  nuff  said  oh  and the pizza is delicious  and the salads   i m not sure why butter lettuce is so good but i would recommend it as part of the avocado salad service   quick and friendly   we had our food in less than 10 minutes and could decide whether to make it a slow or fast night depending on cocktails and winebuzzing  there is nothing to pick up your mood sometimes than a lively atmosphere  my partner had already been with a group of friends on a weekend and had a great time  and this time it was just the two of us chowing down  sometimes i dont  always feel like i m in a city when i m roaming around our london streets  what a snobbish nyc thing to say    and that can be wonderful   but sometimes you just want the buzz of city life and you definitely get that vibe here
1218	3.0	Quick glance:+ great location near Shoreditch station+ large venue - pizza is OK- a bit pricey for the volume of foodI came here for lunch with a friend and liked its convenient location next to Shoreditch Station. The venue is huge so there is little waiting time. Cost of pizza isn't prohibitive but you don't get a lot of food, and I didn't find the pizza particularly to my taste. Most other dishes, such as the salads, seem to be side dishes and cannot be ordered as mains, so the choice could be limiting if you want something else other than pizza.	quick glance   great location near shoreditch station  large venue   pizza is ok  a bit pricey for the volume of foodi came here for lunch with a friend and liked its convenient location next to shoreditch station  the venue is huge so there is little waiting time  cost of pizza isn t prohibitive but you don t get a lot of food  and i didn t find the pizza particularly to my taste  most other dishes  such as the salads  seem to be side dishes and cannot be ordered as mains  so the choice could be limiting if you want something else other than pizza 
1219	2.0	Really not worth the effort. Decent enough food (the mac and cheese is particularly good) and a buzzy venue. However, it's overly crowded and the social seating is uncomfortable and means you can be overly close to other punters, some of whom definitely shouldn't be allowed out without adult supervision.	really not worth the effort  decent enough food  the mac and cheese is particularly good  and a buzzy venue  however  it s overly crowded and the social seating is uncomfortable and means you can be overly close to other punters  some of whom definitely shouldn t be allowed out without adult supervision 
1220	1.0	The food is mediocre at best the experience was also mediocre at best...A friend of mine and came to Pizza east after I had a sudden pizza craving while in east London. We walked in and where made to wait for 15 minutes in their 'bar' area. Its not apparent where you order or where the wine list is, you have to ask around and *try* to find a waiter to get what you want in. We gave up and waited our turn to get seated. In the mean time though, the restaurant was far from packed but I believe they where heavily understaffed.When we sat down, I was handed the menu and then made a choice: Potato, Garlic, Pancetta pizza with some sharp Italian cheese which I can't remember. I was told that they had screwed up the menu and that choice was not available but rather it would be a pizza with no pancetta and rosemary instead which I found odd, they where not really willing to do what was on the menu which was a tad ridiculous so I went with what the waiter had said. We ordered drinks as well, I had a glass of a youngish primitivo... alas the primitivo was served in a thick small glass which was for me is a NONO.The piece de resistance is really that my pizza arrived BEFORE our drinks and I was then asked if we had already drunk out drinks (like it was our fault lol)Overall,mediocre. The wine list is mediocre. The food is not innovative and pizzas crumble to pieces when you slice them which means you have to sort of piece them back together to try to eat them and highly overpriced for what it is. The venue is nice but I highly recommend you look elsewhere.	the food is mediocre at best the experience was also mediocre at best   a friend of mine and came to pizza east after i had a sudden pizza craving while in east london  we walked in and where made to wait for 15 minutes in their  bar  area  its not apparent where you order or where the wine list is  you have to ask around and  try  to find a waiter to get what you want in  we gave up and waited our turn to get seated  in the mean time though  the restaurant was far from packed but i believe they where heavily understaffed when we sat down  i was handed the menu and then made a choice  potato  garlic  pancetta pizza with some sharp italian cheese which i can t remember  i was told that they had screwed up the menu and that choice was not available but rather it would be a pizza with no pancetta and rosemary instead which i found odd  they where not really willing to do what was on the menu which was a tad ridiculous so i went with what the waiter had said  we ordered drinks as well  i had a glass of a youngish primitivo    alas the primitivo was served in a thick small glass which was for me is a nono the piece de resistance is really that my pizza arrived before our drinks and i was then asked if we had already drunk out drinks  like it was our fault lol overall mediocre  the wine list is mediocre  the food is not innovative and pizzas crumble to pieces when you slice them which means you have to sort of piece them back together to try to eat them and highly overpriced for what it is  the venue is nice but i highly recommend you look elsewhere

1222	4.0	This place has a very cool vibe, as others have already observed, very New York style trendy; being on the ground level of the Tea Building (aka below the infamous Shoreditch House).My one eye-rolling complaint would be the pretentious and elongated method of being seated, the whole (fake) trick of *we're just like so super awesome and busy we can't seat you just yet but spend more money at our bar while you wait* doesn't fool me when I can see that a good 25% of the restaurant tables are unoccupied but the waiting game I must play so I sit and drink my tap water a bit reluctantly until they decide to seat me 15 minutes later...The food was awesome though. And whilst the pizzas are great, even the non-pizza things are worth mentioning. They have a rotating dish-of-the-week in the non-pizza menu section which is either a roast meat/ gnocchi or pasta creation as well as fantastic seasonal vegetable side dishes (crispy artichoke with aioli butter was a highlight and the minted edamame).Most tables are communal dining which is fine by me but the seats were fixed to the floor making the whole situation a bit inflexible. They were of an interesting aesthetic (sort of swivelling-industrial-devices) but ultimately not the most comfortable. I would say Pizza East epitomises the general Shoreditch atmosphere and milieu, so worth a trip to take visitors for a bit of 'London Cool'.	this place has a very cool vibe  as others have already observed  very new york style trendy  being on the ground level of the tea building  aka below the infamous shoreditch house  my one eye rolling complaint would be the pretentious and elongated method of being seated  the whole  fake  trick of  we re just like so super awesome and busy we can t seat you just yet but spend more money at our bar while you wait  doesn t fool me when i can see that a good 25  of the restaurant tables are unoccupied but the waiting game i must play so i sit and drink my tap water a bit reluctantly until they decide to seat me 15 minutes later   the food was awesome though  and whilst the pizzas are great  even the non pizza things are worth mentioning  they have a rotating dish of the week in the non pizza menu section which is either a roast meat  gnocchi or pasta creation as well as fantastic seasonal vegetable side dishes  crispy artichoke with aioli butter was a highlight and the minted edamame  most tables are communal dining which is fine by me but the seats were fixed to the floor making the whole situation a bit inflexible  they were of an interesting aesthetic  sort of swivelling industrial devices  but ultimately not the most comfortable  i would say pizza east epitomises the general shoreditch atmosphere and milieu  so worth a trip to take visitors for a bit of  london cool

We stayed till around 1.30am (the cocktails here are great as well) and they were still serving when we left! Really great pizza and selection of cocktails and desserts and the waitress was unusually cherpy for 12.30am which was really great. Would definitely come here again, it really hit my midnight craving for pizza spot!	was having a cocktail with a friend on a saturday night in shoreditch when we decided to try and find somewhere to eat at 11 o clock at night  pizza east was a great find  thanks to yelp   we stayed till around 1 30am  the cocktails here are great as well  and they were still serving when we left  really great pizza and selection of cocktails and desserts and the waitress was unusually cherpy for 12 30am which was really great  would definitely come here again  it really hit my midnight craving for pizza spot 
1224	4.0	Has heard good things about this place so thought I would give it a go. I wasn't initially impressed with the menu. I am simple when it comes to pizza and I just want meat. As such broccoli doesn't really do it for me. Anyway I opted for the salami/chilli pizza whilst my dinner companion had veal meatball pizza. Both were excellent although the salami was my favourite. I really liked the look and feel of the place and will return. Only niggle was that the service wasn't that quick even though the restaurant was reasonably quiet.	has heard good things about this place so thought i would give it a go  i wasn t initially impressed with the menu  i am simple when it comes to pizza and i just want meat  as such broccoli doesn t really do it for me  anyway i opted for the salami chilli pizza whilst my dinner companion had veal meatball pizza  both were excellent although the salami was my favourite  i really liked the look and feel of the place and will return  only niggle was that the service wasn t that quick even though the restaurant was reasonably quiet

They mean EVERYTHING as well, all drinks and wines.YES please.I love cheese and meats, its kind of my thing. These guys have some really special pecorinos and gorgonzolas that will leave you wondering about gout in your future years. If you have dessert and believe me when I say, LEAVE SPACE for it - for the LOVE of all things mouthwatering have the Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tart. I would die happily being baked into one of these. It is unreal.Its so wonderfully cheap on a Monday that you almost feel guilty eating such fresh and quality food that you might be tempted to go on another day just to make up for it...I will be going again... and again...mmmmmsaltedcaramelchocolatedeath	this place is absolutely delicious  everything about it is delicious  especially if you sign up to be a pizza east lover and entitle yourself to 50  off everything on the menu on mondays  they mean everything as well  all drinks and wines yes please i love cheese and meats  its kind of my thing  these guys have some really special pecorinos and gorgonzolas that will leave you wondering about gout in your future years  if you have dessert and believe me when i say  leave space for it   for the love of all things mouthwatering have the salted caramel and chocolate tart  i would die happily being baked into one of these  it is unreal its so wonderfully cheap on a monday that you almost feel guilty eating such fresh and quality food that you might be tempted to go on another day just to make up for it   i will be going again    and again   mmmmmsaltedcaramelchocolatedeath
1232	3.0	Pizza East is your classic Shoreditch hipster establishment. The decor is very cool, and the ambiance is nice when it isn't too crowded. However, what it makes up for in cool lamps and tables it sort of lacks in the excitingness of the food. What they offer is pretty tasty, don't get me wrong, but it just is pretty standard in terms of being a pizza establishment, without offering extra amazing quality. It's also a bit pricey. tldr: check it out for lunch, share a couple starters with a friend.	pizza east is your classic shoreditch hipster establishment  the decor is very cool  and the ambiance is nice when it isn t too crowded  however  what it makes up for in cool lamps and tables it sort of lacks in the excitingness of the food  what they offer is pretty tasty  don t get me wrong  but it just is pretty standard in terms of being a pizza establishment  without offering extra amazing quality  it s also a bit pricey  tldr  check it out for lunch  share a couple starters with a friend

On a good day, their menu is great, not just pizza but other stuff too ( Im not a pizza fan- and why do I go here? as my friends are) However we've been a few times and they've run out of pretty much everything on the menu.Cheese board is a highlight and good for group dining.	i like pizza east as we have a keyring that means we get 50  off on mondays  we ve been a few times and its half and half  on a good day  their menu is great  not just pizza but other stuff too   im not a pizza fan  and why do i go here  as my friends are  however we ve been a few times and they ve run out of pretty much everything on the menu cheese board is a highlight and good for group dining 
1234	4.0	Very good pizza in an industrial setting in the heart of Shoreditch. Popped in for an early lunch on a Saturday, and for a while pretty much had the staff to ourselves. Even when they were a little more stretched, they were still the right kind of attentive and super friendly.Their pizza is decent. Not Franco Manca good, but up there. A friend had the lasagne, which I finished off (it was huge), and I think I'm going to have it next time I go. Or will I? The other pizzas did sound tempting...Highly recommend making a reservation if planning an evening visit.	very good pizza in an industrial setting in the heart of shoreditch  popped in for an early lunch on a saturday  and for a while pretty much had the staff to ourselves  even when they were a little more stretched  they were still the right kind of attentive and super friendly their pizza is decent  not franco manca good  but up there  a friend had the lasagne  which i finished off  it was huge   and i think i m going to have it next time i go  or will i  the other pizzas did sound tempting   highly recommend making a reservation if planning an evening visit 
1235	2.0	The pizza was mediocre and we had to sit at the bar even though there were tables available. We also found a bristle from the oven brush in one of the pizzas.If pseudo  rustic hipster crap is what you're after, look no further!  It's pretentious and overpriced with pretty poor service (although our waiter was pretty OK). We were also charged a 12.5% service charge  even though we were only two people sitting at the bar.	the pizza was mediocre and we had to sit at the bar even though there were tables available  we also found a bristle from the oven brush in one of the pizzas if pseudo  rustic hipster crap is what you re after  look no further   it s pretentious and overpriced with pretty poor service  although our waiter was pretty ok   we were also charged a 12 5  service charge  even though we were only two people sitting at the bar

1238	4.0	My God, the cheese. I'm not a huge pizza lover, which is good because the pizza we ordered here was not great, but I am a lover of charcuterie and cheeseboards. Maybe even too much so. If you need to woo me, do it with a cheeseboard. But not just any old one. I was really excited to see the sheer variety of tapas-like dishes on Pizza East's menu, the meatballs and calamari alone were whispering sweet nothings to me. But dammit, the cheese must come first. I'll come back for you, meatballs, I never leave a man behind. We ate so much incredible oil soaked focaccia dipped in a creamy goats cheese and topped with proscuitto that I could have died happy. Seriously was the best thing I had eaten since my return from Vancouver. The pizza... meh. The service... inattentive but good when we got it. The atmosphere... much cooler and trendier that you expect from the outside. This is a huge place but mega popular. I'm already wondering when I can go back.	my god  the cheese  i m not a huge pizza lover  which is good because the pizza we ordered here was not great  but i am a lover of charcuterie and cheeseboards  maybe even too much so  if you need to woo me  do it with a cheeseboard  but not just any old one  i was really excited to see the sheer variety of tapas like dishes on pizza east s menu  the meatballs and calamari alone were whispering sweet nothings to me  but dammit  the cheese must come first  i ll come back for you  meatballs  i never leave a man behind  we ate so much incredible oil soaked focaccia dipped in a creamy goats cheese and topped with proscuitto that i could have died happy  seriously was the best thing i had eaten since my return from vancouver  the pizza    meh  the service    inattentive but good when we got it  the atmosphere    much cooler and trendier that you expect from the outside  this is a huge place but mega popular  i m already wondering when i can go back

1240	4.0	I know this archetype: It's Beretta in San Francisco, a new wave of Neapolitan-style pizza with good desserts, a selection of amari, and some cocktails.  I liked it, and I'll be back if I'm in the neighborhood, but I wasn't blown away.Our party of 3 waited 45 minutes at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night.  Not terribly surprising; we went around the corner for a pint, and the hostess took my cell number and called me when our table was ready.We were seated at the communal table, which is more like a cheek-by-jowl table: there is NO ELBOW ROOM at all, due to the fixed position of the stools.  None.  It was actually uncomfortably tight.  Hey Pizza East folks, I don't know if you can re-space the attached stools, but you really ought to consider it.The pizza (I had the basic: mozzerella, basil, tomato) was a good thin-crust style, though there was a certain graininess to the melted cheese that was slightly unpleasant.  My friends enjoyed their meaty pizzas.Desserts good; I had an averna to go with (+1 point for having an amari section on the drinks menu; -1 for putting Fernet Branca and Mente on it -- how about ones people want to drink? Oh right, I forgot we're in hipster-town -- it's more about the image than the taste).Overall I liked it, but I'm by no means in love.  Beretta retains its place in my heart.	i know this archetype  it s beretta in san francisco  a new wave of neapolitan style pizza with good desserts  a selection of amari  and some cocktails   i liked it  and i ll be back if i m in the neighborhood  but i wasn t blown away our party of 3 waited 45 minutes at 7 30pm on a tuesday night   not terribly surprising  we went around the corner for a pint  and the hostess took my cell number and called me when our table was ready we were seated at the communal table  which is more like a cheek by jowl table  there is no elbow room at all  due to the fixed position of the stools   none   it was actually uncomfortably tight   hey pizza east folks  i don t know if you can re space the attached stools  but you really ought to consider it the pizza  i had the basic  mozzerella  basil  tomato  was a good thin crust style  though there was a certain graininess to the melted cheese that was slightly unpleasant   my friends enjoyed their meaty pizzas desserts good  i had an averna to go with   1 point for having an amari section on the drinks menu   1 for putting fernet branca and mente on it    how about ones people want to drink  oh right  i forgot we re in hipster town    it s more about the image than the taste  overall i liked it  but i m by no means in love   beretta retains its place in my heart 
1241	2.0	I had high hopes for this place. The location is great, right on Shoreditch High Street and in the very cool Tea Building. No wonder it is always so busy. One would hope that the food will live up to the location, but I was quite disappointed. Pizza is made to order with a variety of toppings and at a reasonable price. However, the crust is not very thin and on the doughy side. I had a hard time cutting it with my knife. I resorted to scrapping the toppings off and left the crust behind. I also had the burrata, aubergine and tomato starter. I am a big fan of burrata cheese and I don't think you need to do much to it, just some olive oil and salt to let the fresh flavor shine through, but this starter didn't managed to do that. There are a lot of good restaurants in Shoreditch, so I don't think I will be coming back any time soon.	i had high hopes for this place  the location is great  right on shoreditch high street and in the very cool tea building  no wonder it is always so busy  one would hope that the food will live up to the location  but i was quite disappointed  pizza is made to order with a variety of toppings and at a reasonable price  however  the crust is not very thin and on the doughy side  i had a hard time cutting it with my knife  i resorted to scrapping the toppings off and left the crust behind  i also had the burrata  aubergine and tomato starter  i am a big fan of burrata cheese and i don t think you need to do much to it  just some olive oil and salt to let the fresh flavor shine through  but this starter didn t managed to do that  there are a lot of good restaurants in shoreditch  so i don t think i will be coming back any time soon 
1242	3.0	Good pizza joint with an industrial, warehouse ambiance which may not appeal to everyone.  The service was great when compared to elsewhere in London.  I had the veal meatball, prosciutto and cream pizza and it was tasty - could have used more prosciutto, but the dough and sauce were nicely done.  £13 is a bit pricey for a pizza, but I suppose that's the toppings.  The pizza didn't impress me, but it did hit the spot after a busy morning.	good pizza joint with an industrial  warehouse ambiance which may not appeal to everyone   the service was great when compared to elsewhere in london   i had the veal meatball  prosciutto and cream pizza and it was tasty   could have used more prosciutto  but the dough and sauce were nicely done    13 is a bit pricey for a pizza  but i suppose that s the toppings   the pizza didn t impress me  but it did hit the spot after a busy morning 
1243	4.0	Obviously this is a pit stop for anyone with an eye for a great pizza. Freshly cooked, perfect density to the dough and toppings were assorted and generous. I opted for the Margarita (in my opinion the door stop of any pizza joint - if you cant do that right your in the wrong business!) Fab. Had to ask for chilli oil but other than that the service was fine. Were not talking fine dining here just good honest well made pizza. Simple.	obviously this is a pit stop for anyone with an eye for a great pizza  freshly cooked  perfect density to the dough and toppings were assorted and generous  i opted for the margarita  in my opinion the door stop of any pizza joint   if you cant do that right your in the wrong business   fab  had to ask for chilli oil but other than that the service was fine  were not talking fine dining here just good honest well made pizza  simple 
1244	2.0	Sorry to be Debbie downer. I am just not impressed with Pizza East at all. I ordered a Chicken Caesar, she ordered a pizza. Hers deserved 4 stars, mine one. Totally drenched in greasy dressing and about 3 salad leafs in the whole dish. I would have settled for 3 stars were it not for the fact that the service was horrendous. I felt like our mere presence was irritating to the waiter who just wanted to go home. Wait for food was too long for how fresh it tasted. I don't even think we tipped - which is saying something as my girlfriend is a proud American tipper! Decor is better than the food.

1246	4.0	As far as I'm concerned there's only a couple of things that pizza joints need to get right - the dough and the toppings (duh!).This place does both well. For starters the dough is not heavy at all. It puffs up around the outside of your edible circle and bears all the hallmarks of fresh yeast in use.Toppings-wise there is a lot to choose from, and about 4 vegetarian options available which is always a bonus.Service isn't massively attentive, but I don't think it needs to be. You don't go to out for pizza to expect your own waiter, lurking over your shoulder topping up the vino. You go for tasty, filling and good value eats in a nice environment (that's not to say the staff aren't helpful).The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great. Even at 3pm on a Friday there's activity and plenty of people dotted around what is a vast eating room. There's a naked charm to the place, with all the exposed concrete and wooden floorboards, offset nicely by all the authentic extras they have hanging around and the roaring pizza oven.2 pizzas, 2 salads, 2 pints of Bitburger and a carafe of tap water came in at almost bang on £50 including the 12.5% service charge.	as far as i m concerned there s only a couple of things that pizza joints need to get right   the dough and the toppings  duh   this place does both well  for starters the dough is not heavy at all  it puffs up around the outside of your edible circle and bears all the hallmarks of fresh yeast in use toppings wise there is a lot to choose from  and about 4 vegetarian options available which is always a bonus service isn t massively attentive  but i don t think it needs to be  you don t go to out for pizza to expect your own waiter  lurking over your shoulder topping up the vino  you go for tasty  filling and good value eats in a nice environment  that s not to say the staff aren t helpful  the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great  even at 3pm on a friday there s activity and plenty of people dotted around what is a vast eating room  there s a naked charm to the place  with all the exposed concrete and wooden floorboards  offset nicely by all the authentic extras they have hanging around and the roaring pizza oven 2 pizzas  2 salads  2 pints of bitburger and a carafe of tap water came in at almost bang on  50 including the 12 5  service charge

So the food - I had the pork (it was huge!) and tasted good and my husband had a meaty pizza, which was also good. It's loud and buzzing and dark so great for a party group...or an impromptu meal :)	it s a good place to go  if you can t think of where to go in shoreditch   we d spent a night at the crown   shuttle and we were starving  so we needed food and fast   step outside and there is pizza east   the food is good and it s great for an impromptu meal   their service is fine and the interior is a very cool  industrial style room  so the food   i had the pork  it was huge   and tasted good and my husband had a meaty pizza  which was also good  it s loud and buzzing and dark so great for a party group   or an impromptu meal   
1248	4.0	I'm entirely aware that I am perhaps a harsh critic but it is not without merit. After working within the hospitality industry for many year I have earned the rite and gained the experience to know what is acceptable and critique it accordingly. never the less my rave review have been few and far between but I am please to add another to the current few.A Monday night at Pizza east is a bustling affair. Every seat was taken, the bar was full and a long line of eager non-bookings were awaiting for the rare chance of a table not turning up. This all explains the two hour limit for each booking.The American warehouse feel follows right through with an Italian and American mixed wine list which is a fair size starting at £19 per bottle. The food menu is inspired and dynamic. For starters the lamb meatballs, pork rib, Courgette, aubergine fritti, roasted 3 colour beets and smoked mackerel were wonderful. Red mullet crudo was fresh and delish but I was the only one at a table of five that enjoyed it. The pizza list of twelve varieties were unique and interesting and the Mushrooms, ricotta, spinach, egg was perfectly cooked with the egg still runny coating the pizza as you slice, the Coppa, cima di rapa, mascarpone, pine nuts was gorgeous but no one in our party liked the veal, procuto and cream.

Nothing special, don't waste your money and go have better food at Pizza Express, which now, all of a sudden, seems very nice! I guess I had high expectations having amazing pizza at Shoreditch House upstairs for the same price. (It's members-only though.)	since this place is owned by private members club soho house  you d expect it to be good however  in short  the pizzas completely failed to live up to their price  nothing special  don t waste your money and go have better food at pizza express  which now  all of a sudden  seems very nice  i guess i had high expectations having amazing pizza at shoreditch house upstairs for the same price   it s members only though  
1251	4.0	+ Delicious pizza, + awesome industrial interior, - noisyI am a huge pizza fan and at every city I travel to I am checking on outstanding pizza restaurants. Visiting London my first shot was already successful: 11 outstanding freshly prepared variations are waiting at Pizza East at Shoreditch High Street and Portobello Road. The restaurant in Shoreditch is located at the ground floor of an old tea factory using plenty of their relicts in the interior. Downstairs is a club that I didn't visit but I actually looked interesting.The branch in West London reminds more of a kitchen caused by the ceiling high tile walls and open pizza bar. Anyways, foodies that love pizza will find their happy place here! E. g. the Speck & Spinach Pizza is mouth-watering!Credit cards accepted! Average pizza: £11, pint of beer: £4, wine £5 (glass)/ £20 (carafe).	  delicious pizza    awesome industrial interior    noisyi am a huge pizza fan and at every city i travel to i am checking on outstanding pizza restaurants  visiting london my first shot was already successful  11 outstanding freshly prepared variations are waiting at pizza east at shoreditch high street and portobello road  the restaurant in shoreditch is located at the ground floor of an old tea factory using plenty of their relicts in the interior  downstairs is a club that i didn t visit but i actually looked interesting the branch in west london reminds more of a kitchen caused by the ceiling high tile walls and open pizza bar  anyways  foodies that love pizza will find their happy place here  e  g  the speck   spinach pizza is mouth watering credit cards accepted  average pizza   11  pint of beer   4  wine  5  glass    20  carafe  
1252	4.0	We were here on a Sunday night for an early dinner so it wasn't super packed, but it was definitely busy. We started off with lamb meatballs and garlic bread. The meatballs were delicious but the garlic bread was amazing. The garlic bread was even better when dipped in the meatball sauce.  I had the potato, pancetta, puzzone and garlic pizza. For a potato lover like me it was perfection. My husband and sister in law however aren't as big on potatoes and thought there was too much potato. My husband had the spicy sausage, mozzarella and tenderstem broccoli pizza. I tried a little and thought it was pretty tasty. The sausage was just a little spicier than I would prefer, but my husband loved it. My sister in law got the buffalo mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza. She enjoyed her pizza, but couldn't detect any buffalo flavor. After trying some, my husband and I could slightly detect it.My husband only got 1 bite of the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake before my sister in law and I devoured it. It was cheesecake at it's best. Not too soft, not frozen. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because of the extremely uncomfortable seats at the communal table that we got seated at.	we were here on a sunday night for an early dinner so it wasn t super packed  but it was definitely busy  we started off with lamb meatballs and garlic bread  the meatballs were delicious but the garlic bread was amazing  the garlic bread was even better when dipped in the meatball sauce   i had the potato  pancetta  puzzone and garlic pizza  for a potato lover like me it was perfection  my husband and sister in law however aren t as big on potatoes and thought there was too much potato  my husband had the spicy sausage  mozzarella and tenderstem broccoli pizza  i tried a little and thought it was pretty tasty  the sausage was just a little spicier than i would prefer  but my husband loved it  my sister in law got the buffalo mozzarella  tomato and basil pizza  she enjoyed her pizza  but couldn t detect any buffalo flavor  after trying some  my husband and i could slightly detect it my husband only got 1 bite of the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake before my sister in law and i devoured it  it was cheesecake at it s best  not too soft  not frozen  i wanted to give this place 5 stars  but couldn t because of the extremely uncomfortable seats at the communal table that we got seated at

1254	3.0	Decent value.   Our personal favorites include the Pancetta Pizza, Sausage Pizza and Mushroom Pizza (in that order).  I ate with two friends who had recently come back from Italy and, while acknowledging that nothing can really match what one can find on Amalfi coast, it was still very very good.  The service left a little to be desired, as it was tough to get the attention of any waiter, much less our own, in such a large restaurant, capable of accommodating hundreds of people I imagine.   Anyway a decent experience overall.	decent value    our personal favorites include the pancetta pizza  sausage pizza and mushroom pizza  in that order    i ate with two friends who had recently come back from italy and  while acknowledging that nothing can really match what one can find on amalfi coast  it was still very very good   the service left a little to be desired  as it was tough to get the attention of any waiter  much less our own  in such a large restaurant  capable of accommodating hundreds of people i imagine    anyway a decent experience overall

We all ordered cocktails, pizzas, and salads that were served quickly and tasted great. A good spot for a casual, no-fuss meal.	very cool space and good for groups  i came in with a group of 8 and we were seated at a communal table  which i thought would be awkward but  in the end  it wasn t a big deal  we all ordered cocktails  pizzas  and salads that were served quickly and tasted great  a good spot for a casual  no fuss meal 
1256	5.0	Very buzzy and some of the dishes are excellent, including cold meat platters.  Service is polite and relatively efficient. One of the best features is the small bar area with chunky wooden table. Make sure you fully understand the pizza you are ordering - some are, shall I say, experimental and may not be to your taste (for example the one I ordered that did not have a tomato base - but I think they have now taken that one off the menu).  Other dishes like pork belly or the salads or the garlic bread are also just.... just... amazing.  Puts most restaurants to shame at any price point in my honest opinion.For dining as a couple, try sitting at the eating bar area in the centre of the restaurant - you get very personal service from the staff there (we even got some free tasting!) and it feels more fun that a table for two.  The bar facing the kitchen is also good but it is quite hot and the service comes from behind you which doesn't work nearly as well - however, watching the chefs at work is good fun so if you are in the area on business and dining alone, I would thoroughly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar for a meal.  All in all, you just cannot fault this place - food of this quality often costs twice the price, it really is a must-see restaurant for hearty, casual food.	very buzzy and some of the dishes are excellent  including cold meat platters   service is polite and relatively efficient  one of the best features is the small bar area with chunky wooden table  make sure you fully understand the pizza you are ordering   some are  shall i say  experimental and may not be to your taste  for example the one i ordered that did not have a tomato base   but i think they have now taken that one off the menu    other dishes like pork belly or the salads or the garlic bread are also just     just    amazing   puts most restaurants to shame at any price point in my honest opinion for dining as a couple  try sitting at the eating bar area in the centre of the restaurant   you get very personal service from the staff there  we even got some free tasting   and it feels more fun that a table for two   the bar facing the kitchen is also good but it is quite hot and the service comes from behind you which doesn t work nearly as well   however  watching the chefs at work is good fun so if you are in the area on business and dining alone  i would thoroughly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar for a meal   all in all  you just cannot fault this place   food of this quality often costs twice the price  it really is a must see restaurant for hearty  casual food 
1257	4.0	Showed up here on the front end of a blind date not having any preconceived notions, but walked out having had a great experience.  To be fair, I should warn you that no pizza was consumed so I can not comment on the quality of that.  I had fully intended to have pizza, I had even picked the top two choices out for myself, but after our waitress broke the neck of two bottles of wine whilst trying to open them (I have NEVER seen that done before), the manager came over to help out with the service of our table and make sure no more wine bottles were wasted.  Let me say, he was awesome.  I pretty much always ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is since they see it all come out, and likely eat it all fairly regularly, and 9 times out of 10 I too will eat what ever they like (hey I'm quite the omnivore).  This time, the manager suggested the Bone marrow appetizer and the Chilli Crab Bruschetta.... shoot I'm game, and luckily so was my date.  The crab brchetta was ok, I'd give it a 3/5 but the bone marrow was just amazing, esPECially when you took the roasted garlic and salt and spread them all together onto some of the sourdough toast.  AMAZEBALLS.  We had both of those with the Syrah from Cline vineyards (that too was pretty good).In true European fasion (I have NO idea what I'm talking about here) we followed that with the chicken spinach green bean salad.  It tasted very English, like one of the sandwiches you can buy in marks and spencers, but not bad.  The chicken was a little warmer than I would have liked, and there was a little more dressing than I would have put on it.  At this point they were aiming for a 5/5, I was SUPER happy.  Then came the deserts... Meh. We had the salted chocolate caramel and the doughnuts again suggestions of the staff.  I think it was the doughnuts that fully knocked them back down to 4 stars and made me question the staff's pallets.  They were fried in the same oil that a LOT of chicken had been fried in, so as soon as you ate them you tasted nohing but KFC.  Oh well, not eeryonw can be perfect right?

1258	4.0	Pizza East was on my to-do list of places to try before leave London, as my partner is a truly pizza-lover, so we came today for a Saturday lunch. I was quite impressed about the venue, I didn't imagine it was so big when I first saw the entrance. The warehouse decor is nice too, and the toilets are superb (they have hand soap and moisturizer from Cowshed, which I really liked).Staff were quite nice but a bit slow, despite it wasn't very busy at that time. We didn't mind anyway, as we had plenty of time and it was pouring outside.Regarding the food, I loved it. I had the fried polenta with San Marzano tomatoes and spinach, which was incredibly tasty, specially the tomatoes, full of flavour. I loved it, and it was only £5.5. My partner has the pizza with ground beef, scamorza and dried tomatoes, that was very good. We finished the meal with 2 espressos, that weren't anything remarkable. We only drank one orange juice and still water, and paid £30 including service, which I think it's a bit expensive, mainly because of the drinks. The orange juice, although it was freshly squeezed, was rather small (less than 200ml in a tiny glass), and each espresso was £2.50.Overall, a very pleasant and good meal, and a recommended place, despite some items in the menu being overpriced.	pizza east was on my to do list of places to try before leave london  as my partner is a truly pizza lover  so we came today for a saturday lunch  i was quite impressed about the venue  i didn t imagine it was so big when i first saw the entrance  the warehouse decor is nice too  and the toilets are superb  they have hand soap and moisturizer from cowshed  which i really liked  staff were quite nice but a bit slow  despite it wasn t very busy at that time  we didn t mind anyway  as we had plenty of time and it was pouring outside regarding the food  i loved it  i had the fried polenta with san marzano tomatoes and spinach  which was incredibly tasty  specially the tomatoes  full of flavour  i loved it  and it was only  5 5  my partner has the pizza with ground beef  scamorza and dried tomatoes  that was very good  we finished the meal with 2 espressos  that weren t anything remarkable  we only drank one orange juice and still water  and paid  30 including service  which i think it s a bit expensive  mainly because of the drinks  the orange juice  although it was freshly squeezed  was rather small  less than 200ml in a tiny glass   and each espresso was  2 50 overall  a very pleasant and good meal  and a recommended place  despite some items in the menu being overpriced

They had a range of cheeses on display that captured my attention (is it wrong to be fascinated by artisan cheeses?) and various jars of things that looked pretty useful as presents etc. I'll update the review once I've been back for food.

1263	3.0	Having heard the great reviews from friends, especially about the mouth-wateringly garlicky garlic bread, I pretty much wet myself in excitement when Pizza East was the suggested venue for a catch up with old work friends. (and yes, before you say, I'm sad - I get THAT excited by the prospect of food).Inside, it's typically Shoreditch cool - lots of crazy outfits that look like they require a manual to even get over your head, big and wild hairstyles and the tightest of jeans that just look dangerous. I quite liked the industrial dark metal and wood, it felt like you were in some underground cavern. The staff were as polite as could be, but were obviously rather rushed off their feet and pressurised to get people moving. We were hassled to order (admittedly, we were slightly later than expected) and some of the drinks we ordered had to be sent back as they were wrong. Normally I like to read every single item on the menu but being rushed, I didn't have this luxury. As a great potato fan, I was most intrigued by the pizza that came with potato, pancetta and puzzone (a most delicious cheesy cheese) and it didn't disappoint - I was reluctant to finish the last bite. My one comment was having been to probably more Pizza Express's than is legal, I generally use that as the baseline for rating pizzas and, as with all the pizzas I saw, they leave about 2 inches of bare crust around the edges. As everyone knows, this is on the same level of offence and horror as receiving a sandwich where the filling doesn't reach the edges. I was also slightly upset none of the pizzas didn't have names. Even something like 'George' or 'Bella' would have been better than nothing. Pudding was most exciting and the four of us shared the doughnuts, honeycomb  pannacotta and ice cream (pistachio, vanilla and honeycomb). All were dribblesomely good. All in all, it's a great place to head to for a casual catch up but I wouldn't go just for the pizza. I will definitely be back however, as there's some intriguing Antipasti that I've got my beady eye on.	having heard the great reviews from friends  especially about the mouth wateringly garlicky garlic bread  i pretty much wet myself in excitement when pizza east was the suggested venue for a catch up with old work friends   and yes  before you say  i m sad   i get that excited by the prospect of food  inside  it s typically shoreditch cool   lots of crazy outfits that look like they require a manual to even get over your head  big and wild hairstyles and the tightest of jeans that just look dangerous  i quite liked the industrial dark metal and wood  it felt like you were in some underground cavern  the staff were as polite as could be  but were obviously rather rushed off their feet and pressurised to get people moving  we were hassled to order  admittedly  we were slightly later than expected  and some of the drinks we ordered had to be sent back as they were wrong  normally i like to read every single item on the menu but being rushed  i didn t have this luxury  as a great potato fan  i was most intrigued by the pizza that came with potato  pancetta and puzzone  a most delicious cheesy cheese  and it didn t disappoint   i was reluctant to finish the last bite  my one comment was having been to probably more pizza express s than is legal  i generally use that as the baseline for rating pizzas and  as with all the pizzas i saw  they leave about 2 inches of bare crust around the edges  as everyone knows  this is on the same level of offence and horror as receiving a sandwich where the filling doesn t reach the edges  i was also slightly upset none of the pizzas didn t have names  even something like  george  or  bella  would have been better than nothing  pudding was most exciting and the four of us shared the doughnuts  honeycomb  pannacotta and ice cream  pistachio  vanilla and honeycomb   all were dribblesomely good  all in all  it s a great place to head to for a casual catch up but i wouldn t go just for the pizza  i will definitely be back however  as there s some intriguing antipasti that i ve got my beady eye on 
1264	4.0	Visiting here from southern-Cali for three weeks, I was finally craving some 'american' comfort food - particularly a pizza. Alas, I was not willing to go down to the local fast-food joint, so I wound up here via Yelp. I found my pizza to be delicious and satisfying, but seriously overpriced at nearly  £12. The butter-lettuce salad with mustard seed vinaigrette was fresh and tasty. The donut and chocolate desert with a cup of pleasantly prepared cappuccino, was quite heavenly. The service was reasonable when it was there, but it odd how no one server seemed to be assigned to my table. This was a problem because they never seemed to know whether I had already been helped. I saw this happen to a couple other tables too. Maybe they are just trying to being helpful. Like many other Yelpers before me, I too was mesmerized by the interior design and atmosphere. I envied every aspect, from the layout, which was incredibly spacious, to the lighting and even the restrooms. I was there shortly after 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty quiet then, but patrons trickled in steadily. I imagined how this place must be at night. I fantasized about moving into this hip neighborhood and living an upscale social life just for this restaurant and everything it epitomizes. Maybe I would just settle for a job as a server instead... sigh!	visiting here from southern cali for three weeks  i was finally craving some  american  comfort food   particularly a pizza  alas  i was not willing to go down to the local fast food joint  so i wound up here via yelp  i found my pizza to be delicious and satisfying  but seriously overpriced at nearly   12  the butter lettuce salad with mustard seed vinaigrette was fresh and tasty  the donut and chocolate desert with a cup of pleasantly prepared cappuccino  was quite heavenly  the service was reasonable when it was there  but it odd how no one server seemed to be assigned to my table  this was a problem because they never seemed to know whether i had already been helped  i saw this happen to a couple other tables too  maybe they are just trying to being helpful  like many other yelpers before me  i too was mesmerized by the interior design and atmosphere  i envied every aspect  from the layout  which was incredibly spacious  to the lighting and even the restrooms  i was there shortly after 2pm on a saturday afternoon  it was pretty quiet then  but patrons trickled in steadily  i imagined how this place must be at night  i fantasized about moving into this hip neighborhood and living an upscale social life just for this restaurant and everything it epitomizes  maybe i would just settle for a job as a server instead    sigh 
1265	4.0	If there was a 4 and a half star rating, this place would probably get it. The place was packed and we had to wait nearly twenty minutes on a reserved table for 2, which I was blown away by. The atmosphere is good but I prefer a slightly quieter place. Service was impressively excellent, considering the hectic environment.While we found the pizza to be very good, it was slightly overrated. Considering this place gets called one of the best pizza joints in London, there is room for improvement. However, you can't argue with the prices -  it's only a few quid more than Pizza Express.However, the sides and dessert are what really sold it - the roasted potatoes were absurdly good, and both the gelato and the salted chocolate caramel tart were worth a trip back alone.	if there was a 4 and a half star rating  this place would probably get it  the place was packed and we had to wait nearly twenty minutes on a reserved table for 2  which i was blown away by  the atmosphere is good but i prefer a slightly quieter place  service was impressively excellent  considering the hectic environment while we found the pizza to be very good  it was slightly overrated  considering this place gets called one of the best pizza joints in london  there is room for improvement  however  you can t argue with the prices    it s only a few quid more than pizza express however  the sides and dessert are what really sold it   the roasted potatoes were absurdly good  and both the gelato and the salted chocolate caramel tart were worth a trip back alone

I thought the pizza very good, loved the base, and though my salad tasted like the salt shaker was emptied into it, the management was over at my table in minutes rectifying the situation and making me feel at ease about saying something. How problems are dealt with is a good showing of the quality of a restaurant.

1267	4.0	Is it strange that I was impressed by everything but the pizza?The venue is, as mentioned countless times, absolutely stunning. I think it's the lighting that really seals the deal, although the open fire ovens and walls of wood sell the swanky Shoreditch vibe as well. The rustic interior is made more accessible by the choice of individual, bar, or communal tables which the helpful hosting team is happy to accommodate.Service was superb. Beyond friendly and attentively unobtrusive, I had wine in my hand before I ordered starters and a starter in my mouth before I ordered a main, just the way I like it. I was astounded by the depth of the menu - seabass carpaccio? Wood roasted bone marrow? Pork belly, borlotti beans, cavalo nero and salsa verde? Razor clams? Forgive me... but pizza, what? It was almost painful to put in two pizza orders after noshing on some of the most delectable bone marrow and calamari I've had to date, and I must say, even with egg, fontina and potato involved, the pizza was underwhelming at best. Although the plot thinned, it certainly did not ruin the experience - we happily chowed down. I mean, pizza *is* pizza, right?Listen PizzaEast attendees, it's good. Very good. Best pizza ever? Nope, not by a long shot. But for the price, the gorgeous venue, superb staff and fantastic accompanying cast, you'll love the show.Think of it like a movie that wins the Oscar for best supporting role... and perhaps best score, for good measure.	is it strange that i was impressed by everything but the pizza the venue is  as mentioned countless times  absolutely stunning  i think it s the lighting that really seals the deal  although the open fire ovens and walls of wood sell the swanky shoreditch vibe as well  the rustic interior is made more accessible by the choice of individual  bar  or communal tables which the helpful hosting team is happy to accommodate service was superb  beyond friendly and attentively unobtrusive  i had wine in my hand before i ordered starters and a starter in my mouth before i ordered a main  just the way i like it  i was astounded by the depth of the menu   seabass carpaccio  wood roasted bone marrow  pork belly  borlotti beans  cavalo nero and salsa verde  razor clams  forgive me    but pizza  what  it was almost painful to put in two pizza orders after noshing on some of the most delectable bone marrow and calamari i ve had to date  and i must say  even with egg  fontina and potato involved  the pizza was underwhelming at best  although the plot thinned  it certainly did not ruin the experience   we happily chowed down  i mean  pizza  is  pizza  right listen pizzaeast attendees  it s good  very good  best pizza ever  nope  not by a long shot  but for the price  the gorgeous venue  superb staff and fantastic accompanying cast  you ll love the show think of it like a movie that wins the oscar for best supporting role    and perhaps best score  for good measure 
1268	4.0	As I try and loosen my grip on Soho and Camden, by floating East now and again to experience new places in London Town, this cheeky venue was a perfect venue on Saturday for my friend Bexs' Birthday meal. Located in the venue formally known as the Tea Bar, which I had been to once or twice whilst at uni, but I can hardly remember it, Pizza East is where Elvis would eat a pizza if he had the opportunity. There's something very soothing about eating here. The people are relaxed and being in East London very cool, the staff are helpful and don't need prompting when liquid supplies are running low. They also handled our group of 16 with excellent timing and precision. The dim lighting and the iron tables all add to an atmosphere of people just reveling in the enjoyment of being out and about with one another whilst having some delicious food in the process. The food itself is delish. All the pizzas are ten-inches, made from an in house recipe, and topped with all manner of toppings ranging from Margherita to the more elaborate San Daniele ham, buffalo ricotta, hazelnut pesto and baby chard. i can, however, thoroughly recommend the spicy sausage and broccoli which will set you back about 12 golden coins. Pricey but certainly worth it. Once you have eaten and drank all you can (a meal with drinks will probably set you back about 20 nuggets) you can head on down to the downstairs bar which is low lit and stinks of cool. It's not cheap, but it's such a relaxed atmosphere, you won't mind too much. It's a great place to avoid the pretentious places in East London, whilst still revelling in its cool vibe. Highly recommended.	as i try and loosen my grip on soho and camden  by floating east now and again to experience new places in london town  this cheeky venue was a perfect venue on saturday for my friend bexs  birthday meal  located in the venue formally known as the tea bar  which i had been to once or twice whilst at uni  but i can hardly remember it  pizza east is where elvis would eat a pizza if he had the opportunity  there s something very soothing about eating here  the people are relaxed and being in east london very cool  the staff are helpful and don t need prompting when liquid supplies are running low  they also handled our group of 16 with excellent timing and precision  the dim lighting and the iron tables all add to an atmosphere of people just reveling in the enjoyment of being out and about with one another whilst having some delicious food in the process  the food itself is delish  all the pizzas are ten inches  made from an in house recipe  and topped with all manner of toppings ranging from margherita to the more elaborate san daniele ham  buffalo ricotta  hazelnut pesto and baby chard  i can  however  thoroughly recommend the spicy sausage and broccoli which will set you back about 12 golden coins  pricey but certainly worth it  once you have eaten and drank all you can  a meal with drinks will probably set you back about 20 nuggets  you can head on down to the downstairs bar which is low lit and stinks of cool  it s not cheap  but it s such a relaxed atmosphere  you won t mind too much  it s a great place to avoid the pretentious places in east london  whilst still revelling in its cool vibe  highly recommended

Honestly, I liked the space and the atmosphere better than the pizza, which I felt wasn't overwhelmingly memorable.There's allegedly music/dancing downstairs some nights which I wouldn't mind coming back for.	pizza east has a great atmosphere  a buzzy  candle lit glow that s very inviting  it s a lovely space without being intimidatingly posh or trying too hard  honestly  i liked the space and the atmosphere better than the pizza  which i felt wasn t overwhelmingly memorable there s allegedly music dancing downstairs some nights which i wouldn t mind coming back for 
1270	2.0	This place has got me totally confused. I tried to book a table for five for dinner on Saturday night and the person at the end of the line said we could either have a 6:30 or 10:30 seating. I felt a bit like Goldilocks when I said the first seating was too early, the second seating was too late and could I please, please, please have something in between? No dice. We got lumbered with the 6:30 slot, which I sheepishly sold into my friends as 'the opportunity to get in even more drinking time after dinner.' It was a good thing they believed me because we certainly did get the drinking time we wanted. My fiance and I arrived slightly late and were snarkily told that our booking was actually at 6pm, everyone was already at the table and that we needed to make sure we were done by 8pm. I thought he was joking and made a sarcastic comment about our booking actually being at 6:30 and walked off towards the table.  Turns out they misheard me when I made the booking and they thought we were in at 6pm, not 6:30 and thus progressed the fast dinner with the rude waiter experience.  Instead of joking around with us and trying to build a rapport, which may have increased his tip, our waiter was stony faced and annoyed thoughout the entire dinner, which made us even more persistent in cracking jokes at him and trying to make him laugh (which he finally did while we were paying the bill!).The decor in this place is stunning and they've done it up fantastically well, however I supposed anything's an improvement on the industrial bar space that used to be here. Too bad the food doesn't match the great decor. To start, we ordered what had to be the oilest garlic bread I've had in my life. They must have slathered half a ciabatta in an entire pack of butter and then chucked ten entire cloves of garlic on top. Gross. The pizzas were okay. Yep, just okay. I ordered the tomato, mozerella, olive, anchovy and caper pizza which arrived with a huge crust to pizza ratio. I just didn't need five inches of crust. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I so wanted this place to be good, but because my expectations were high, I was even more disappointed.  But we won in the end, because we were out of there at 8pm on the dot and oozed our way down to Concrete, the bar in the basement.	this place has got me totally confused  i tried to book a table for five for dinner on saturday night and the person at the end of the line said we could either have a 6 30 or 10 30 seating  i felt a bit like goldilocks when i said the first seating was too early  the second seating was too late and could i please  please  please have something in between  no dice  we got lumbered with the 6 30 slot  which i sheepishly sold into my friends as  the opportunity to get in even more drinking time after dinner   it was a good thing they believed me because we certainly did get the drinking time we wanted  my fiance and i arrived slightly late and were snarkily told that our booking was actually at 6pm  everyone was already at the table and that we needed to make sure we were done by 8pm  i thought he was joking and made a sarcastic comment about our booking actually being at 6 30 and walked off towards the table   turns out they misheard me when i made the booking and they thought we were in at 6pm  not 6 30 and thus progressed the fast dinner with the rude waiter experience   instead of joking around with us and trying to build a rapport  which may have increased his tip  our waiter was stony faced and annoyed thoughout the entire dinner  which made us even more persistent in cracking jokes at him and trying to make him laugh  which he finally did while we were paying the bill   the decor in this place is stunning and they ve done it up fantastically well  however i supposed anything s an improvement on the industrial bar space that used to be here  too bad the food doesn t match the great decor  to start  we ordered what had to be the oilest garlic bread i ve had in my life  they must have slathered half a ciabatta in an entire pack of butter and then chucked ten entire cloves of garlic on top  gross  the pizzas were okay  yep  just okay  i ordered the tomato  mozerella  olive  anchovy and caper pizza which arrived with a huge crust to pizza ratio  i just didn t need five inches of crust  wrong  wrong  wrong  i so wanted this place to be good  but because my expectations were high  i was even more disappointed   but we won in the end  because we were out of there at 8pm on the dot and oozed our way down to concrete  the bar in the basement 
1271	4.0	I'd been looking forward to trying Pizza East for a long time - it's one of those restaurants you keep hearing about. But, living on the opposite side of London, I knew it was going to be a while before I'd make it out there.But finally! Finally! I have tried it, and friends, it is pretty good. First of all, consider your surroundings. This is not a humble place serving up just pizza - and great pizza at that. It's all about atmosphere. Communal tables, carafes of wine poured into small glass tumblers, industrial decor, exposed pipes, skinny-jeaned waiters, and pricey grub. This ain't no Pizza Express.Still - I had my dinner and it was good. It wasn't GREAT. But it was good. And one huge thumbs up from me: they have two pizzas on their already stripped down menu that don't contain any cheese at all! This is great news for my dairy-free compadres. I had the portabello mushroom pizza with no egg and it was lovely - cheeseless and all.And the olives and marcona almonds to start were lovely - more than enough for two people to share.Certainly there are elements of Pizza East to appreciate, but if I was really craving awesome pizza and didn't care much about the scene, I'd probably go elsewhere.	i d been looking forward to trying pizza east for a long time   it s one of those restaurants you keep hearing about  but  living on the opposite side of london  i knew it was going to be a while before i d make it out there but finally  finally  i have tried it  and friends  it is pretty good  first of all  consider your surroundings  this is not a humble place serving up just pizza   and great pizza at that  it s all about atmosphere  communal tables  carafes of wine poured into small glass tumblers  industrial decor  exposed pipes  skinny jeaned waiters  and pricey grub  this ain t no pizza express still   i had my dinner and it was good  it wasn t great  but it was good  and one huge thumbs up from me  they have two pizzas on their already stripped down menu that don t contain any cheese at all  this is great news for my dairy free compadres  i had the portabello mushroom pizza with no egg and it was lovely   cheeseless and all and the olives and marcona almonds to start were lovely   more than enough for two people to share certainly there are elements of pizza east to appreciate  but if i was really craving awesome pizza and didn t care much about the scene  i d probably go elsewhere

It is definitely worth going out of your way for if you like pizzas that are more either ""New York"" or rustic Italian style. However, be advised you should book a table in advance. Cool warehouse-y ambience and interesting food makes this a welcome change from the usual pizza experience. Pizzas: Topping of gourmet cheeses and meats usually not found outside of a proper Italian delicatessen. Not to worry for those with more tame tastes, as they do have a basic mozzeralla and tomato pizza on the menu. The base is made of wheat and thinner and crispier than the norm. Starters: Had the octopus and potato which was absolutely lovely.Wine& beer: Not too thrilled with the white wine selection, the red was much better. Good draught beer selection. Service: Very good, staff greeted us with a warm smile and were helpful with menu items I wasn't familiar with, but I could see how the place quickly gets manic.

I was under the impression that there wasn't any to the Chicago Pizza standard...until we went to Pizza East.  The restaurant is massive and very well designed -- love the subway tiles and reclaimed wood doors.  While we didn't think it was a luxury at first, we sat at the bar looking into the kitchen.  Dish after dish was executed by a team of near 10 sous chefs; each looking more amazing than the next. We had mussels with aioli, calamari, and two pizzas. We could have had more it was so delicious. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the pizza crust was perfect.  I especially loved that they put a solid amount of sauce (most places here don't!) on the pizza.   Thankfully I don't live near by or I would be there every week.	i m on an on going quest to find quality pizza in london  i was under the impression that there wasn t any to the chicago pizza standard   until we went to pizza east   the restaurant is massive and very well designed    love the subway tiles and reclaimed wood doors   while we didn t think it was a luxury at first  we sat at the bar looking into the kitchen   dish after dish was executed by a team of near 10 sous chefs  each looking more amazing than the next  we had mussels with aioli  calamari  and two pizzas  we could have had more it was so delicious  the ingredients were incredibly fresh and the pizza crust was perfect   i especially loved that they put a solid amount of sauce  most places here don t   on the pizza    thankfully i don t live near by or i would be there every week

He had tried to book a table for 18 over the phone, but the lady he spoke to, who was apparently very rude and unhelpful, said that the chef 'could not cope with a table of 18'! How unprofessional is that?!We were told we could sit at 2 tables, although I'm not sure what difference it actually makes if we are all together or not.We had a table booked for 8pm but we weren't seated until after 9pm, at 2 tables at opposite ends of the restaurant, even though there were empty tables together (apparently they were booked, it seems by them running an hour late, it meant we lost our seating!).During our meal the waiter didn't come over once to see if we wanted more drinks or anything, and in fact when we wanted anything we had to go off and find it!We asked repeatedly for condiments that didn't actually arrive until we had pretty much finished. Coffee after dinner took 25 minutes to arrive, and only after we had asked for it twice.The food was substandard- my pizza was about 70% crust, and had 4 measley dribbles of cheese on it- they must be making a fortune by selling warm bread at £12 a pop!It also tasted so strongly of garlic that I couldn't taste anything else. I love garlic, but that doesn't mean I want to taste it for several days afterwards.We complained so much that they didn't charge us for our drinks, but I've worked in enough restaurants to know that if people are that unsatisfied, they shouldn't charge us anything at all.They even had the audacity to charge us service charge, then come back to our table to tell us there was 25p missing off our bill!I think it's safe to say that none of us will be going back, and I will also be telling everyone I know not to go.

We arriced early and sat in the bar area .. surrounded by delicious italian treats, we supped on wine and had a good natter.The space in this place is phenomenal! The loos are great aswell .. old wooden doors, big victorian taps and Cowshed soaps and handcream. We were seated on time. The restaurant was busy but not too loud. The service was fantastic. We had bruschetta and Calamari to start. Both perfectly cooked. Then Pizzas to follow..the pizza bases are amazing! Almost buttery. Really yums! We found the service great, the decor great and the food great. Would absolutely recommend and go back again!	we went to pizza east for valentines     looking for something low key  scrummy but with a little bit of sexiness  it didnt disappoint  we arriced early and sat in the bar area    surrounded by delicious italian treats  we supped on wine and had a good natter the space in this place is phenomenal  the loos are great aswell    old wooden doors  big victorian taps and cowshed soaps and handcream  we were seated on time  the restaurant was busy but not too loud  the service was fantastic  we had bruschetta and calamari to start  both perfectly cooked  then pizzas to follow  the pizza bases are amazing  almost buttery  really yums  we found the service great  the decor great and the food great  would absolutely recommend and go back again 
1280	5.0	I was absolutely thrilled with my visit here. Old industrial buildings do have a special charme and this old Tea Building provides a wonderful setting for a restaurant. I very much liked the deco, especially those funky lamps. PIZZA EAST also serves convincing food. Man, the garlic bread was just awesome! And these olives which were served with roasted almonds were mouth-watering. We also highly appreciated the choice of buying home filtered water for a good price instead of the usual mineral water. And then came the pizza! It had a thin dough, crispy and perfect. The toppings were fresh and just in the right amount so the pizza didn't start sagging. Great place for food and people watching in a hip area.	i was absolutely thrilled with my visit here  old industrial buildings do have a special charme and this old tea building provides a wonderful setting for a restaurant  i very much liked the deco  especially those funky lamps  pizza east also serves convincing food  man  the garlic bread was just awesome  and these olives which were served with roasted almonds were mouth watering  we also highly appreciated the choice of buying home filtered water for a good price instead of the usual mineral water  and then came the pizza  it had a thin dough  crispy and perfect  the toppings were fresh and just in the right amount so the pizza didn t start sagging  great place for food and people watching in a hip area

1286	4.0	In a part of London that is actually a bit below-par for eateries, Pizza East is reliable and fun. Don't believe the bad reviews here, people are clearly getting carried away... The pizzas may not be the best in town, but they are better than average, reasonably priced and executed with some flair and originality. There are also some quirky little gems on the menu that lift everything else, for example the cauliflower cheese is great!	in a part of london that is actually a bit below par for eateries  pizza east is reliable and fun  don t believe the bad reviews here  people are clearly getting carried away    the pizzas may not be the best in town  but they are better than average  reasonably priced and executed with some flair and originality  there are also some quirky little gems on the menu that lift everything else  for example the cauliflower cheese is great

1288	3.0	Pizza on the Move in Farringdon, Adagio in Soho, Pizza East, a second branch of Franco Manca, and now word has it Ramsay wants to turn part of the York & Albany into a pizzeria. The newest craze in London is pizza. Who'd have thought. The concept is pretty well established, one would think, but perhaps it's similar to those fashion fads: someone also thought those shoulder pads should make a comeback, and suddenly you see them crop up everywhere and anywhere. Now fortunately, pizza is an idea a lot more sensible than shoulder pads. I'm not a huge fan, not even of pizzas, that is. Still, one has to try.The room is large. Decor is rustic. Music is funky. Waiting staff is Shoreditch-bred. There's a silver MacBook on the reception desk, but it was clearly not switched on. All a bit poser-hipster then?No matter. You go for the pizza, unless you don't particularly like pizza, like myself. I had one, nevertheless. Anchovies, capers, olives, on the usual concoction of pomodoro e mozzarella. The pizza base was very semolina-y. Not bad. Quite satisfying. Nothing to rave about, though. Olives with almonds to nibble are nice; very grassy-tasting olives. Quite large, too.I will return. With a bunch of friends, people in a good mood, happy to be loud and chatty and raucous, and we shall drink copious amounts of Valpolicella or Montepulciano. That way, no one will pay all that much attention to their food. And I think that's the point of pizza.	pizza on the move in farringdon  adagio in soho  pizza east  a second branch of franco manca  and now word has it ramsay wants to turn part of the york   albany into a pizzeria  the newest craze in london is pizza  who d have thought  the concept is pretty well established  one would think  but perhaps it s similar to those fashion fads  someone also thought those shoulder pads should make a comeback  and suddenly you see them crop up everywhere and anywhere  now fortunately  pizza is an idea a lot more sensible than shoulder pads  i m not a huge fan  not even of pizzas  that is  still  one has to try the room is large  decor is rustic  music is funky  waiting staff is shoreditch bred  there s a silver macbook on the reception desk  but it was clearly not switched on  all a bit poser hipster then no matter  you go for the pizza  unless you don t particularly like pizza  like myself  i had one  nevertheless  anchovies  capers  olives  on the usual concoction of pomodoro e mozzarella  the pizza base was very semolina y  not bad  quite satisfying  nothing to rave about  though  olives with almonds to nibble are nice  very grassy tasting olives  quite large  too i will return  with a bunch of friends  people in a good mood  happy to be loud and chatty and raucous  and we shall drink copious amounts of valpolicella or montepulciano  that way  no one will pay all that much attention to their food  and i think that s the point of pizza 
1289	4.0	Amazing place and food! Pizzas are just perfect, and if you try the selection of wines and the antipasto, you will feel like you are in little Italy. Aso really good parties in the room downstairs and really nice mix of people... Only a bit overpriced, but worth it if you compare with their neighbours in Shoreditch.	amazing place and food  pizzas are just perfect  and if you try the selection of wines and the antipasto  you will feel like you are in little italy  aso really good parties in the room downstairs and really nice mix of people    only a bit overpriced  but worth it if you compare with their neighbours in shoreditch

1291	3.0	"As other reviews have said, Pizza East is ok. Nothing special and not worth going out of your way for, but fine for a pizza with friends if you're in the area. The interior is very Shoreditch, being a converted warehouse with nice lighting and a large bar area. They have a selection of draught beer as well as wine by the glass or bottle. The pizzas only have two toppings, plus cheese. It's certainly more of the ""gourmet"" ingredients, so don't expect a ham and pineapple. The dough used for the pizzas was different, like flakey pastry rather than the usual wood fired pizza base. The restaurant was busy when I went, but service was adequate. Nothing outstanding, but no faults either."	as other reviews have said  pizza east is ok  nothing special and not worth going out of your way for  but fine for a pizza with friends if you re in the area  the interior is very shoreditch  being a converted warehouse with nice lighting and a large bar area  they have a selection of draught beer as well as wine by the glass or bottle  the pizzas only have two toppings  plus cheese  it s certainly more of the  gourmet  ingredients  so don t expect a ham and pineapple  the dough used for the pizzas was different  like flakey pastry rather than the usual wood fired pizza base  the restaurant was busy when i went  but service was adequate  nothing outstanding  but no faults either

1293	1.0	Pizza East holds the rare distinction of being the worst Italian restaurant, and one of the worst restaurants, I've ever eaten in. Quick service to the bar was welcome, but once there you're more likely to be on the receiving end of the waiter's enthusiastic shouting than any service. A glass of the Proseco was £8, flat, and tasted more like suds than wine. I ordered the Chicken cacciatore and some olives to have with the Proseco. The Chicken arrived first, despite asking for it after the olives, but no matter. Mild for the rubbish-ness to come. The chicken tasted like it was reheated, the capsicum was as bland as bark, and the bacon was obviously out of a shrink-wrapped packet. Halfway through and unable to finish something that was less palatable than what I could have cooked after several months stranded in the outback, the olives arrived. Dry, chewy, and overly salted I'm starting to doubt whether they were actually olives. Judging that this dodgy, overpriced food was the best I was going to get, and that wine was for some bizarre reason on tap instead of poured, I decided to leave. By the time the waiter asked if there was anything wrong, my hearty yeses ignored, it became clear this is standard operating procedure at Pizza East. Save your money, go somewhere, anywhere else, you won't be disappointed.	pizza east holds the rare distinction of being the worst italian restaurant  and one of the worst restaurants  i ve ever eaten in  quick service to the bar was welcome  but once there you re more likely to be on the receiving end of the waiter s enthusiastic shouting than any service  a glass of the proseco was  8  flat  and tasted more like suds than wine  i ordered the chicken cacciatore and some olives to have with the proseco  the chicken arrived first  despite asking for it after the olives  but no matter  mild for the rubbish ness to come  the chicken tasted like it was reheated  the capsicum was as bland as bark  and the bacon was obviously out of a shrink wrapped packet  halfway through and unable to finish something that was less palatable than what i could have cooked after several months stranded in the outback  the olives arrived  dry  chewy  and overly salted i m starting to doubt whether they were actually olives  judging that this dodgy  overpriced food was the best i was going to get  and that wine was for some bizarre reason on tap instead of poured  i decided to leave  by the time the waiter asked if there was anything wrong  my hearty yeses ignored  it became clear this is standard operating procedure at pizza east  save your money  go somewhere  anywhere else  you won t be disappointed 
1294	3.0	I was here on a Saturday lunchtime and it wasn't particularly busy so I can't comment on some of the service issues that others have mentioned during the evening rush. We liked the stripped down warehouse space and decor, the banquettes and tables were stylish and in the afternoon it was well lit in a great location and we got a seat by the window to watch the world passing by. My dining companion was hungover and struggled with her crayfish and samphire Pizza - which was to my benfit as I thought it was very tasty and preferred it to the San Daniele ham, tomato, ricotta, pesto, baby chard that I had. Some others have criticised the Pizza but I liked it, a slightly chewy base and decent toppings. We didn't have starters - which is a shame because that's what people seem to be raving about. However I can recommend the Bloody Mary as a spicy tonic. I wouldn't make a special effort to come back here but then it's location is pretty handy so I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up here again. I didn't realise this place was owed by the same guy as Shoreditch House but it is the same building so I guess that makes sense..	i was here on a saturday lunchtime and it wasn t particularly busy so i can t comment on some of the service issues that others have mentioned during the evening rush  we liked the stripped down warehouse space and decor  the banquettes and tables were stylish and in the afternoon it was well lit in a great location and we got a seat by the window to watch the world passing by  my dining companion was hungover and struggled with her crayfish and samphire pizza   which was to my benfit as i thought it was very tasty and preferred it to the san daniele ham  tomato  ricotta  pesto  baby chard that i had  some others have criticised the pizza but i liked it  a slightly chewy base and decent toppings  we didn t have starters   which is a shame because that s what people seem to be raving about  however i can recommend the bloody mary as a spicy tonic  i wouldn t make a special effort to come back here but then it s location is pretty handy so i wouldn t be surprised if i ended up here again  i didn t realise this place was owed by the same guy as shoreditch house but it is the same building so i guess that makes sense

Really buzzy atmosphere, bar staff were good fun and entertaining. We were taken to our seats and were sat in the middle of a long table next to other diners, not really my thing sharing eating space with complete strangers!!! Too many try hard's from around the Shoreditch/Hoxton area. In fact one twenty something asked us to keep the noise down, little oik!!!! We shared some starters calamari was tough, and can't even remember what else we ordered. However the Pizza was pretty good although expensive for what you get. Redeeming feature 50 % discount for Shoreditch House members. Had fun but that was more about the company than the venue..	went to pizza east with a couple of friends recently  front desk staff were very friendly and kept us updated on how long we had to wait via their electronic gizmos  we had a drink in the bar first  really buzzy atmosphere  bar staff were good fun and entertaining  we were taken to our seats and were sat in the middle of a long table next to other diners  not really my thing sharing eating space with complete strangers    too many try hard s from around the shoreditch hoxton area  in fact one twenty something asked us to keep the noise down  little oik     we shared some starters calamari was tough  and can t even remember what else we ordered  however the pizza was pretty good although expensive for what you get  redeeming feature 50   discount for shoreditch house members  had fun but that was more about the company than the venue

The only real difference was that there were many more longer tables to squeeze people together. We also feared that there would be more of a yuppie/hipster vibe and, although that was partly true, it did not intrude upon our overall experience.The pizza was the freshest and probably best baked in London. Wines can come from the ""tap"". Don't expect wine glasses for the wines though. Instead, they come in very rustic glasses. Just enjoy the semi-club, semi-lounge, industrial, minimalist restaurant atmosphere! I would have preferred being sat at a table (as opposed to the bar) but I think they were very booked and only had tables for large groups that night. My friend's pasta dish was a touch too oily but otherwise was enjoyed.Service was professional and non-intrusive.Good food. Slightly more expensive than what you pay for (I am still waiting for cheaper and yet hip pizza places) but I couldn't ask for more at the moment."	as soon as we walked in  my friend and i were reminded of the meat packing district in manhattan  the only real difference was that there were many more longer tables to squeeze people together  we also feared that there would be more of a yuppie hipster vibe and  although that was partly true  it did not intrude upon our overall experience the pizza was the freshest and probably best baked in london  wines can come from the  tap   don t expect wine glasses for the wines though  instead  they come in very rustic glasses  just enjoy the semi club  semi lounge  industrial  minimalist restaurant atmosphere  i would have preferred being sat at a table  as opposed to the bar  but i think they were very booked and only had tables for large groups that night  my friend s pasta dish was a touch too oily but otherwise was enjoyed service was professional and non intrusive good food  slightly more expensive than what you pay for  i am still waiting for cheaper and yet hip pizza places  but i couldn t ask for more at the moment 
1298	2.0	The short of it: Good location, disappointing pizza. The long of it: Location - Pizza East is in the Tea Building, which upped the trend factor merely by postal address. The interior certainly lives up to the Shoreditch loft-style spaces. It does seem like an environment that could easily suck you in so you can see and be seen. In fact, I like the place visually. Sadly, the food didnt taste as good as the place looks. We ordered some olives and almonds to start, which were tasty with a hint of citrus. I debated between two pizza choices, and my date took my first choice (the spicy sausage and sprouting broccoli) and so I got my second choice (artichoke and pancetta). They both looked like nice pizzas, but I was disappointed with mine. It was a sauceless pizza, so it was just bland bland bland. Even with a dousing of chili oil, I still wasnt excited and my tastebuds were bored after 1/3 was eaten. The spicy sausage pizza was much better, which reminds me to go with my gut in the future. It still lacked sauce and that acid I like from tomatoes, but if I ever return, that's what I'll get. I wish I had better words to say... but I dont. Go for a glass of wine and olives and some people watching, but eat somewhere else.	the short of it  good location  disappointing pizza  the long of it  location   pizza east is in the tea building  which upped the trend factor merely by postal address  the interior certainly lives up to the shoreditch loft style spaces  it does seem like an environment that could easily suck you in so you can see and be seen  in fact  i like the place visually  sadly  the food didnt taste as good as the place looks  we ordered some olives and almonds to start  which were tasty with a hint of citrus  i debated between two pizza choices  and my date took my first choice  the spicy sausage and sprouting broccoli  and so i got my second choice  artichoke and pancetta   they both looked like nice pizzas  but i was disappointed with mine  it was a sauceless pizza  so it was just bland bland bland  even with a dousing of chili oil  i still wasnt excited and my tastebuds were bored after 1 3 was eaten  the spicy sausage pizza was much better  which reminds me to go with my gut in the future  it still lacked sauce and that acid i like from tomatoes  but if i ever return  that s what i ll get  i wish i had better words to say    but i dont  go for a glass of wine and olives and some people watching  but eat somewhere else 
1299	2.0	I agree with other reviewers that the Qype reviews are more realistic than those on other sites I've read. Gorgeous place, sad and tough pizza :( Its in the Tea Building (home to Shoreditch House and next to Albion at the Boundary Project) and only 10 minutes walk from Liverpool Street but somehow, a block past Bishopsgate, haircuts get choppier, clothes get funkier and the City is left behind. Inside it looks great - all East-end warehouse with stone floors, chrome and exposed pipes; people laughing; and happy smiley service. And beers at lunchtime  yey. For starters, we had tomato bruschetta and marinated olives with almonds. The olives were yummy but the bread on the bruschetta was toasted within about an inch of its life and too hard to eat. Boo. Then the pizza. Pizza East has had great reviews from other food bloggers and I was excited to try it, but sadly I was disappointed. I had the spinach, goat's cheese, tomato and pine nut pizza (the best pizza I've ever had in my life was melt-in-the-mouth gorgonzola and spinach) but it was dry with not enough cheese and too much crust which was so hard my fingers got sore trying to cut it. I prefer a softer chewier base, a la Pizza Express which I have a food crush on. El G's potato, garlic, rosemary, fontina and parmesan pizza looked better but wasn't remarkable and probably had too much cheese. For 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 beers it was £18 each  not bad. I thought the venue and atmosphere were great - I want to check it out for after-work drinks at the bar and live music at the basement club Concrete.

1300	1.0	Ridiculously expensive for mediocre food. We were seated in the middle of the room and the seats were very uncomfortable. Other than that, it was very noisy, little choice in food, no gluten free and very bland salads. When the bill came finally we were horrified, yet were unable to get a discount from anyone, despite the fact that one of our party had not been eating, three were not drinking and one was gluten intolerant. The only thing I could possibly compliment was our particular waiter, who was attentive and friendly. Very disappointing end to our night.	ridiculously expensive for mediocre food  we were seated in the middle of the room and the seats were very uncomfortable  other than that  it was very noisy  little choice in food  no gluten free and very bland salads  when the bill came finally we were horrified  yet were unable to get a discount from anyone  despite the fact that one of our party had not been eating  three were not drinking and one was gluten intolerant  the only thing i could possibly compliment was our particular waiter  who was attentive and friendly  very disappointing end to our night

I'm not sure I see the point of this place anymore and after the hype dies down, if they don't improve customer service they will fail. I was flabbergasted by the utter disregard with which I was recently treated. It's a beautiful space and the menu has some definite highlights, but c'mon don't treat your patrons like doormats! PREVIOUS REVIEW:Very good but doesn't live up to the hype. It's a bit 'style over substance' but that doesn't mean it's lacking substance, just that it's an especially stylish place. The white pizzas are better than the ones with tomato sauce (as their sauce is just too sweet). The starters I tried (roast bone marrow and polenta with chicken livers) are awesome.

1302	4.0	Buzzy, cool & fun. I thought the food was quite nice, but reading the other reviews makes me think that I might lack a degree of sophistication. What I found most interesting, apart from the very NY style that people have pointed out, is that they've got a variety of seating. Most of it is filled with regular tables, but there's also one massive table and also a counter where people sit and eat. The former is good for waiting and having a drink, the latter a bit sushi-bar like, which I think is probably a conscious design aimed at people dinign alone. I think it's good. It's different.	buzzy  cool   fun  i thought the food was quite nice  but reading the other reviews makes me think that i might lack a degree of sophistication  what i found most interesting  apart from the very ny style that people have pointed out  is that they ve got a variety of seating  most of it is filled with regular tables  but there s also one massive table and also a counter where people sit and eat  the former is good for waiting and having a drink  the latter a bit sushi bar like  which i think is probably a conscious design aimed at people dinign alone  i think it s good  it s different 
1303	5.0	This is the most authentic American restaurant I have been anywhere outside of the USA. The decor, down to a T, is absolutely spot on, even if the menu is a little ore European. Despite being on the pricier side, though the Margarita is no more expensive than at Pizza Express, the pizzas are spot on and excellent renditions of anything you will find in NYC. The service is generally good, though ask for anything that veers lsightly off the menu and it can cause problems. That being said, the manager has always been more than happy to compensate for tardiness or tepid coffees. Pizza East is definitely on my list of regular haunts in Shoreditch.	this is the most authentic american restaurant i have been anywhere outside of the usa  the decor  down to a t  is absolutely spot on  even if the menu is a little ore european  despite being on the pricier side  though the margarita is no more expensive than at pizza express  the pizzas are spot on and excellent renditions of anything you will find in nyc  the service is generally good  though ask for anything that veers lsightly off the menu and it can cause problems  that being said  the manager has always been more than happy to compensate for tardiness or tepid coffees  pizza east is definitely on my list of regular haunts in shoreditch

If you want to get a large group for a birthday dinner, this is your place (I heard the birthday song about 4 times at different tables when I was there.) Otherwise, with a smaller group I'd go to Story Deli down the road instead.	pretty good pizza  trendy industrial space  a bit on the pricey side  if you want to get a large group for a birthday dinner  this is your place  i heard the birthday song about 4 times at different tables when i was there   otherwise  with a smaller group i d go to story deli down the road instead 
1305	3.0	I love the decor, I like the atmosphere, but, well, after 4 visits now, I'm just not sure about the food! The pizzas are a bit on the alternative side - I guess they're trying to be more gourmet with them, but I find the base too thin in the middle and too crusty, and the ingredients a bit poncy. Call me old fashioned but give me a straight up bin lid any day (try the Stringray's Globe Cafe up on Columbia Road). I'd consider myself a food enthusiast but here the flavours are bizarre and a lot of them don't come with cheese which surprised a few people in our party! Some are a decent price (£7 or £8) but then they go up to stupid figures, like £14 for the duck meatball one (I had it, and it's not worth it). The garlic bread was hard, greasy and cold. A friend had the £10 lasagne and it was just a small square. The sea bass looked alright though. On the plus side, it's huge so good for large parties, the loos are immaculate, and it's open late. So there are plenty of reasons to go to Pizza East - but not the pizza, imho!	i love the decor  i like the atmosphere  but  well  after 4 visits now  i m just not sure about the food  the pizzas are a bit on the alternative side   i guess they re trying to be more gourmet with them  but i find the base too thin in the middle and too crusty  and the ingredients a bit poncy  call me old fashioned but give me a straight up bin lid any day  try the stringray s globe cafe up on columbia road   i d consider myself a food enthusiast but here the flavours are bizarre and a lot of them don t come with cheese which surprised a few people in our party  some are a decent price   7 or  8  but then they go up to stupid figures  like  14 for the duck meatball one  i had it  and it s not worth it   the garlic bread was hard  greasy and cold  a friend had the  10 lasagne and it was just a small square  the sea bass looked alright though  on the plus side  it s huge so good for large parties  the loos are immaculate  and it s open late  so there are plenty of reasons to go to pizza east   but not the pizza  imho

Pizza East has an elegant décor and subtle lighting, helping to create a warm and intimate atmosphere. The building's industrial heritage has been intelligently maintained in the exposed bricks and pipes, with the large windows giving a trendy and sophisticated feel which is reinforced by the fashionable clientele. We were greeted by the friendly front of house staff, but were asked to wait until a table became available for us as we had no booking. There is a waiting area with a large communal table by the restaurant's bar where we sat and drank a 500ml carafe of their Prosecco on tap £19 and a few pints of Peroni £4 each. It was a Thursday evening, the place was very busy and noisy, and it took them 50 minutes to seat us. I was pleased to see a short but eclectic menu showing some fine starters and desserts alongside the interesting pizze. As a party of 5, we ordered a selection of starters to share and a pizza each. The Sheep milk ricotta bruschette, lambs lettuce with honeycomb and sea salt @ £6 was delicious with the ricotta and honey marrying beautifully together. The bruschetta bread was also nicely toasted and chewy. The Mortadella spread, pistachios, mostarda on rustic bread @ £5 was also good, although the portion was not overly generous. Mortadella is one of the least popular of Italian cold meats in the UK but is one of my favourites. It can be rather fatty and goes very well in a simple sandwich of fresh baguette and butter. The star of the evening however was the Wood roasted bone marrow, radish, parsley, on rustic bread @ £7. My last taste of bone marrow was at St John's a few years ago, and I remember loving it then. I was not disappointed this time round either: the marrow had a deliciously concentrated meaty flavour and melted in the mouth. One of the best dishes I remember spending my £7 on. I ordered a Salami, tomato, mozzarella, red onion, and chilli flakes pizza @ £10. The combination of toppings was simple but nicely put together and with good flavours. The most interesting aspect of the pizza however was the fine dough  the base was thin but had a great chewy consistency. It was beautifully charred giving a woody flavour to the dough. It was an excellent pizza, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The other pizze eaten by my dinner companions were Veal meatballs, prosciutto, sage, lemon, parsley, and cream pizza @ £12; Speck, tomato, mozzarella and rocket pizza @ £11; Clams, tomato, oregano, garlic, chilli flakes, and pecorino pizza @ £12 (apparently a speciality of New England, USA), it looked yummy, and I wished I had ordered that one myself! The general opinion was that all pizze were good, toppings were simple and flavoursome although slightly ungenerous; the base was indeed the best part  chewy, fine and deliciously charred. We also felt that prices above £10 were a tad high. We unfortunately did not have any of the desserts  although I heard that their Hot cinnamon sugar doughnuts with Varlhona chocolate @ £6 is to die for. The total bill was £180 (incl. 12.5% service) among 5 people, or £36 each. In addition to the food, we also had three 500 ml carafes of Prosecco on tap £19 each, 5 pints of Peroni beer £4 each and a glass of Sauvignon blanc @ £8. This is more than I would normally feel happy spending on a mid-week evening  we spent more on drinks than we did on the delicious food. I will certainly be coming back to Pizza East for more roasted bone marrow, clam pizza and hot cinnamon doughnuts, but will stop at a local pub for a good pint beforehand! Verdict  Trendy and beautiful decor, delicious pizza base and toppings at above average prices. The best roasted bone marrow on chunky toast in town and friendly, efficient service make Pizza East a fine place, and one to which I will definitely return.

1313	4.0	"I've had better pizzas in london but I've also had many much worse. I have become a bit of a pizza snob these days as the standard of pizza has seriously improved in recent years in the city, so I would give this place a seven or of ten for the pizza itself. However the real draw of this place is its location in the heart of trendy shoreditch, and is prefect if you are going out with a group of friends. Music billows with a vibrant cool atmosphere in what looks like an old warehouse. Service can be a little 'trendy' e.g. we asked for another drink from a passing waiter only to be told ""i don't DO drink orders"" which we actually ask found rather amusing more than anything."	i ve had better pizzas in london but i ve also had many much worse  i have become a bit of a pizza snob these days as the standard of pizza has seriously improved in recent years in the city  so i would give this place a seven or of ten for the pizza itself  however the real draw of this place is its location in the heart of trendy shoreditch  and is prefect if you are going out with a group of friends  music billows with a vibrant cool atmosphere in what looks like an old warehouse  service can be a little  trendy  e g  we asked for another drink from a passing waiter only to be told  i don t do drink orders  which we actually ask found rather amusing more than anything 
1314	4.0	I see this place has mixed reviews. But the service was flawless. Went last night for a meal with work friends. Venue was gorgeous. The staff didn't look at us snobbily, and the waitress was great. My pizza wasn't great - but then I went for an unconventional topping - potato and ham, but it had a creamy oily base which was weird and no tomato. But they were boviously carefully hand-made etc. and the service wasn't slow which i always appreciate. The house red was like vinegar which is why it hasn't got 5 stars. the vintage black and white photo booth downstairs is great too.	i see this place has mixed reviews  but the service was flawless  went last night for a meal with work friends  venue was gorgeous  the staff didn t look at us snobbily  and the waitress was great  my pizza wasn t great   but then i went for an unconventional topping   potato and ham  but it had a creamy oily base which was weird and no tomato  but they were boviously carefully hand made etc  and the service wasn t slow which i always appreciate  the house red was like vinegar which is why it hasn t got 5 stars  the vintage black and white photo booth downstairs is great too

1318	5.0	From Shoreditch/Soho/etc House comes this huge (by London standards) pizza restaurant, taking up the space previously occupied by the T Bar.The menu consists of a range of pizza/oven stuff and some cold bits (like hams and cheeses). Pizzas are a little bigger than Pizza Express ones but the base and toppings are a hell of a lot more impressive. I had a portobello mushroom & egg pizza while my friend has a pepperoni one. Both came piping hot, with a generous portion of delicious toppings and one of the nicest pizza bases we've ever had (I think only bases in New York top this, though I'd love to be told about other brilliant ones?)Their website has a menu with prices so you can check that out before you go but expect to pay about £25 a head for pizza, wine and an extra nibble or two with service.A great plus is that chilled filtered water is provided by the bottle for free.The place has just opened but you wouldn't know it: service is polite and brisk and the venue seems to be finished to a really high spec. If you used to go to the T Bar you really won't recognise this place.I defy anyone to go here and say they had a crap pizza but this being Yelp, I bet someone will ;)	from shoreditch soho etc house comes this huge  by london standards  pizza restaurant  taking up the space previously occupied by the t bar the menu consists of a range of pizza oven stuff and some cold bits  like hams and cheeses   pizzas are a little bigger than pizza express ones but the base and toppings are a hell of a lot more impressive  i had a portobello mushroom   egg pizza while my friend has a pepperoni one  both came piping hot  with a generous portion of delicious toppings and one of the nicest pizza bases we ve ever had  i think only bases in new york top this  though i d love to be told about other brilliant ones  their website has a menu with prices so you can check that out before you go but expect to pay about  25 a head for pizza  wine and an extra nibble or two with service a great plus is that chilled filtered water is provided by the bottle for free the place has just opened but you wouldn t know it  service is polite and brisk and the venue seems to be finished to a really high spec  if you used to go to the t bar you really won t recognise this place i defy anyone to go here and say they had a crap pizza but this being yelp  i bet someone will

1331	4.0	I've been to Pizza East twice now and largely enjoyed the food, the buzz and the service. I can definitely see the potential for it all to go wrong though - they are incredibly popular and I can imagine that during their busy times, they would be too frantic to service the number of tables they have without sacrificing somewhere. The one time I tried to book, it was for a group of 12 and was told we had to take the group menu, which I felt was too much food and too expensive without enough flexibility. Deciding to press ahead anyway, the event manager booked me in, then had to apologise the next day when the promised date/time was no longer available and we were booked instead at a much earlier time. Needless to say we went elsewhere. However, for my own personal visits with smaller numbers, I've had a great time. They're open late, and I have taken advantage of that both times. On these occasions, I've been able to wander in around 10pm without a reservation and be seated immediately. The service was lovely, stylish, v hip and most importantly, efficient with attention to detail. I think the food is quite reasonably priced considering it's part of the Soho House stable. There are some exceptions to the rule, but happily they didn't interest me. Even the wine selection is quite reasonable, with a decent spread of wines and prices. Wine is served in tumblers, keeping the vibe down to earth. The dishes we've tasted have all been delicious - the star being the roasted bone marrow served with a fresh crisp parsley and radish salad on the side. Scrape the marrow out, spread it on the accompanying toast and sprinkle the salad on top. Absolutely divine!! The pizza menu will not please those who are used to having loads of ingredients and the ability to customise their pizzas. It's definitely more in line with the more authentic italian vibe (fewer ingredients per pizza, keeping flavours simple to showcase the ingredients and the pizza base). Yeah I can see the comparison to the NY pizza style also. The pizzas are big enough for 1 hungry person, more than I could eat with starters. My tip - eat what you can, then take the rest home. It's even better COLD! My favourite pizza is the spicy sausage with sprouting broccoli (but then.they had me at spicy...). I prefer it over the veal meatball one. I need to try the other flavours too but as long as they all have the gorgeous crusty charred base. Best pizza in the neighbourhood. Wouldn't go out of my way to go there but if you're in the Hoxton/Brick Lane area anyway, it's a good option.	i ve been to pizza east twice now and largely enjoyed the food  the buzz and the service  i can definitely see the potential for it all to go wrong though   they are incredibly popular and i can imagine that during their busy times  they would be too frantic to service the number of tables they have without sacrificing somewhere  the one time i tried to book  it was for a group of 12 and was told we had to take the group menu  which i felt was too much food and too expensive without enough flexibility  deciding to press ahead anyway  the event manager booked me in  then had to apologise the next day when the promised date time was no longer available and we were booked instead at a much earlier time  needless to say we went elsewhere  however  for my own personal visits with smaller numbers  i ve had a great time  they re open late  and i have taken advantage of that both times  on these occasions  i ve been able to wander in around 10pm without a reservation and be seated immediately  the service was lovely  stylish  v hip and most importantly  efficient with attention to detail  i think the food is quite reasonably priced considering it s part of the soho house stable  there are some exceptions to the rule  but happily they didn t interest me  even the wine selection is quite reasonable  with a decent spread of wines and prices  wine is served in tumblers  keeping the vibe down to earth  the dishes we ve tasted have all been delicious   the star being the roasted bone marrow served with a fresh crisp parsley and radish salad on the side  scrape the marrow out  spread it on the accompanying toast and sprinkle the salad on top  absolutely divine   the pizza menu will not please those who are used to having loads of ingredients and the ability to customise their pizzas  it s definitely more in line with the more authentic italian vibe  fewer ingredients per pizza  keeping flavours simple to showcase the ingredients and the pizza base   yeah i can see the comparison to the ny pizza style also  the pizzas are big enough for 1 hungry person  more than i could eat with starters  my tip   eat what you can  then take the rest home  it s even better cold  my favourite pizza is the spicy sausage with sprouting broccoli  but then they had me at spicy      i prefer it over the veal meatball one  i need to try the other flavours too but as long as they all have the gorgeous crusty charred base  best pizza in the neighbourhood  wouldn t go out of my way to go there but if you re in the hoxton brick lane area anyway  it s a good option

1334	4.0	Okay, if I said to you try a potato pizza, you might be tempted to ask if I like chips with my mash, or maybe a rice sandwich, but wait. The potato pizza is actually delicious. It is very 'paysanne' in style, simple Italian peasant style potatoes with herbs and a scattering if cheese. It should not work on a pizza base but it does although it did make me a bit sleep afterwards. I loved the feel if this place, like a posh Dickensian canteen with painted brick, school-stle walls in the hallway.

The service was a bit touch and go, with a bit too much attention when we were trying to decide on food and definitely not enough when our glasses went empty. Pizza had minmal flavour and was a bit overpriced. The highlight of the meal turned out to be the starters as we really enjoyed the not so traditional gnocchi and had good fun sucking on the grilled bone marrow.	went with a few friends for a midweek dinner  looking to try out their pizza and was definitely a bit disappointed  the service was a bit touch and go  with a bit too much attention when we were trying to decide on food and definitely not enough when our glasses went empty  pizza had minmal flavour and was a bit overpriced  the highlight of the meal turned out to be the starters as we really enjoyed the not so traditional gnocchi and had good fun sucking on the grilled bone marrow

1338	2.0	I've been to Pizza East a couple of times now. The first time, I enjoyed the buzziness, expansive/cavernous space and the shiny and newness of it all. People said wow it's like a NY place. Um ok. Is that a good thing (outside of NY)? So, I overlooked the fact that they can't make a pizza Margherita (my test of a place that has pizza in its name). I don't know how much sugar they thought would be good to use in the red sauce, but seriously, stop. And then try using good mozzarella. Or maybe a cheap flight to Napoli to see how it's done. Or a jaunt to Santore' up the street, if Napoli is out of the question. Anyway, I digress the chicken livers were good, as was the polenta. However, on my second visit, the only reason I didn't do an immediate about face was that I was there for a birthday party. Before we could even enter the restaurant (on a recent very cold and rainy night), the maitre d' put up his hand in my face and made us wait in the cold (while he was warm) while he dealt with other more important customers. Helluva welcome, buddy. If that's NY style, then you got it in spades and I don't want it. When he finally deigned to let us in and we informed him of our reservation, he shrugged us off to a colleague who had been sitting there idly while he sorted out the important peeps. I hoped the food would save my soured opinion of the place, but it was even more mediocre than the last time I had been there and too salty, too sugary, overcooked and ineptly served by clearly overwhelmed staff. The only reason this place gets two stars is that the interior is beautiful.	i ve been to pizza east a couple of times now  the first time  i enjoyed the buzziness  expansive cavernous space and the shiny and newness of it all  people said wow it s like a ny place  um ok  is that a good thing  outside of ny   so  i overlooked the fact that they can t make a pizza margherita  my test of a place that has pizza in its name   i don t know how much sugar they thought would be good to use in the red sauce  but seriously  stop  and then try using good mozzarella  or maybe a cheap flight to napoli to see how it s done  or a jaunt to santore  up the street  if napoli is out of the question  anyway  i digress the chicken livers were good  as was the polenta  however  on my second visit  the only reason i didn t do an immediate about face was that i was there for a birthday party  before we could even enter the restaurant  on a recent very cold and rainy night   the maitre d  put up his hand in my face and made us wait in the cold  while he was warm  while he dealt with other more important customers  helluva welcome  buddy  if that s ny style  then you got it in spades and i don t want it  when he finally deigned to let us in and we informed him of our reservation  he shrugged us off to a colleague who had been sitting there idly while he sorted out the important peeps  i hoped the food would save my soured opinion of the place  but it was even more mediocre than the last time i had been there and too salty  too sugary  overcooked and ineptly served by clearly overwhelmed staff  the only reason this place gets two stars is that the interior is beautiful

1340	1.0	Might be good for happy hour cocktails, but definitely not good for dinner after happy hour.Service is slow. It took a very long time for server to come about with a menu. Took even longer for her to return to actually take the order and... they had to come back 3 times.. because they were out of 2 entrees and 1 beer. It was unreal. Felt like I was picking from the leftovers.  Should have been a sign to get up and go...and the food took very long to get out. think 45 minutes, to the point, we had to tell the server, that other tables were here later and they were served already.  When the food arrived, omg.. I swear Taco Bell or frozen tacos would have tasted better. We barely nibbled on our and had enough...   When we finally got our check.. we were charged 10% or 12% of service charge.  I think I should have asked to see a manager and bring this to his/her attention, but I am simply too exhausted. Bottom line,,, maybe this is a good place for happy hour cocktail.. but defintely, don't stay for dinner.  The bartending crew may be ok.. but the kitchen needs some improvement.	might be good for happy hour cocktails  but definitely not good for dinner after happy hour service is slow  it took a very long time for server to come about with a menu  took even longer for her to return to actually take the order and    they had to come back 3 times   because they were out of 2 entrees and 1 beer  it was unreal  felt like i was picking from the leftovers   should have been a sign to get up and go   and the food took very long to get out  think 45 minutes  to the point  we had to tell the server  that other tables were here later and they were served already   when the food arrived  omg   i swear taco bell or frozen tacos would have tasted better  we barely nibbled on our and had enough      when we finally got our check   we were charged 10  or 12  of service charge   i think i should have asked to see a manager and bring this to his her attention  but i am simply too exhausted  bottom line    maybe this is a good place for happy hour cocktail   but defintely  don t stay for dinner   the bartending crew may be ok   but the kitchen needs some improvement 
1341	1.0	SO angry about this place. Came for cocktails with a friends and we sat at a high top. They told us to go order at the bar and I got us a huge cocktail to share inside a skull head. They didn't put the passion fruits and other decorations on it as described in the menu. We also ordered some chips and guacamole (at the bar as instructed) and since given so few chips asked for some more to finish up the guac. I was told I had to order the chip refill at the bar and after waiting for 15 minutes and being disregarded, they told me I'd have to order a whole new appetizer and pay for it. So rude.	so angry about this place  came for cocktails with a friends and we sat at a high top  they told us to go order at the bar and i got us a huge cocktail to share inside a skull head  they didn t put the passion fruits and other decorations on it as described in the menu  we also ordered some chips and guacamole  at the bar as instructed  and since given so few chips asked for some more to finish up the guac  i was told i had to order the chip refill at the bar and after waiting for 15 minutes and being disregarded  they told me i d have to order a whole new appetizer and pay for it  so rude 
1342	1.0	OH MY GOD THIS WAS THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE. We came into the restaurant and told the hostess we wanted to just get drinks and an appetizer. We sat down and not a single person came to serve us. We had to walk ourselves up to the bar and order our drinks and appetizers. We than had to walk back up to the bar when we requested more tortilla chips for the mound of guacamole we had ordered. The bartenders treated us like absolute GARBAGE, and ignored us. After 15 minutes, when we caught their attention they told us in order to get extra chips we would have to order a completely new appetizer. Im sorry but who ever taught this restaurant proper customer service needs to re-evaluated.	oh my god this was the worst service in my life  we came into the restaurant and told the hostess we wanted to just get drinks and an appetizer  we sat down and not a single person came to serve us  we had to walk ourselves up to the bar and order our drinks and appetizers  we than had to walk back up to the bar when we requested more tortilla chips for the mound of guacamole we had ordered  the bartenders treated us like absolute garbage  and ignored us  after 15 minutes  when we caught their attention they told us in order to get extra chips we would have to order a completely new appetizer  im sorry but who ever taught this restaurant proper customer service needs to re evaluated 
1343	4.0	Surprisingly decent food for a chain! I got the surprisingly tasty quinoa ensalada. Black beans, sweet potato and charred corn with salsa served atop avo with a cranberry chili  salsa. Topped with sweet potato crisps. The menu caters very well for veg and vegans and the happy hour offer is good as well (although I wish it extended to wine!)	surprisingly decent food for a chain  i got the surprisingly tasty quinoa ensalada  black beans  sweet potato and charred corn with salsa served atop avo with a cranberry chili  salsa  topped with sweet potato crisps  the menu caters very well for veg and vegans and the happy hour offer is good as well  although i wish it extended to wine

1345	2.0	Not quite the worst Mexican food I've had in London, but no where near authentic with lacklustre flavours.Service was not great. Took nearly 10 minutes after getting seated for a waiter to come by. Food came out before drinks, and when I pointed out my order was incorrect they argued about me sending it back versus wanting me to just deal with it. When our drinks did come out, they informed me that they did not have the beer I ordered and tried to give me a substitute that I declined. Our server never came back over to just on us and they tried to charge me for the beer I did not receive anyway. Would not go back or recommend. If you're in the area, go to Wahaca instead. Much better food and overall vibe.	not quite the worst mexican food i ve had in london  but no where near authentic with lacklustre flavours service was not great  took nearly 10 minutes after getting seated for a waiter to come by  food came out before drinks  and when i pointed out my order was incorrect they argued about me sending it back versus wanting me to just deal with it  when our drinks did come out  they informed me that they did not have the beer i ordered and tried to give me a substitute that i declined  our server never came back over to just on us and they tried to charge me for the beer i did not receive anyway  would not go back or recommend  if you re in the area  go to wahaca instead  much better food and overall vibe 
1346	1.0	Good food, awful service. Never before have I been motivated to write a negative review, but tonight's experience was dire.  We waited an age for our drinks and food to appear, because the server took our order on paper rather than via their tablet system.  I don't know if the server forgot to transfer the order, or if it got lost in the kitchen, but either way, we waited 45 mins for food, and a good 20 mins for drinks.  One of our group was brought the wrong beer, and after sending it back, the same beer returned with a passive aggressive server (not the person who took the order) informing him that it was the beer he had ordered. Another ten mins passed until the correct beer showed up. At this point, we had waited so long to eat that my 1 year old daughter was supremely grouchy. Rather than irritate the other customers with a screaming infant, I asked for my food to be boxed, so I could leave early.  Simply boxing my food took 10 mins, all the while my daughter screamed, and annoyed the other customers. The food was good, but ugh, service sucked.	good food  awful service  never before have i been motivated to write a negative review  but tonight s experience was dire   we waited an age for our drinks and food to appear  because the server took our order on paper rather than via their tablet system   i don t know if the server forgot to transfer the order  or if it got lost in the kitchen  but either way  we waited 45 mins for food  and a good 20 mins for drinks   one of our group was brought the wrong beer  and after sending it back  the same beer returned with a passive aggressive server  not the person who took the order  informing him that it was the beer he had ordered  another ten mins passed until the correct beer showed up  at this point  we had waited so long to eat that my 1 year old daughter was supremely grouchy  rather than irritate the other customers with a screaming infant  i asked for my food to be boxed  so i could leave early   simply boxing my food took 10 mins  all the while my daughter screamed  and annoyed the other customers  the food was good  but ugh  service sucked 
1347	1.0	"Service is good. The servers are really on top of their stuff, unless they're new. The food is just terrible. The burritos, even though the menu indicates they have refried beans, do not have any. The menu also indicated it was spicy... It wasn't. And I was explained that ""the mix is done in the morning and it may not hold the spices if served for dinner"" (?)Rice in a burrito... Is expected. Not at Las Iguanas. I could not see more than two or three rice grains in the burrito ... The quesadilla ... Also advertised (in the menu) as spicy. Negative. There was barely any cheese too... Hence the ""quesadilla"" name to it. Fajitas were apparently ok, according to my partner. Beer selection was poor in variety, but the few they have were ok. Especially the ales. I would not go for a Corona, though. Would I recommend this place?... Possibly for drinks during happy hour only. Otherwise, no."	service is good  the servers are really on top of their stuff  unless they re new  the food is just terrible  the burritos  even though the menu indicates they have refried beans  do not have any  the menu also indicated it was spicy    it wasn t  and i was explained that  the mix is done in the morning and it may not hold the spices if served for dinner     rice in a burrito    is expected  not at las iguanas  i could not see more than two or three rice grains in the burrito     the quesadilla     also advertised  in the menu  as spicy  negative  there was barely any cheese too    hence the  quesadilla  name to it  fajitas were apparently ok  according to my partner  beer selection was poor in variety  but the few they have were ok  especially the ales  i would not go for a corona  though  would i recommend this place     possibly for drinks during happy hour only  otherwise  no

She had me at Tuesday!We booked a table to be safe as I know that after work hours London commuters turn into hungry beasts! Long story short we ordered the chicken and prawn fajita .... BANG BANG INTO THE ROOOOOOOM! Flavourville!! Both were so yummy! I was a little surprised I won't lie .. Didn't expect the flavours to hit me so hard on a Tuesday like that!I didn't get to try their cocktail menu as I have a terrible cold :( but I did opt for red wine .. The Merlot was surprisingly nice! A lot of surprises that night haha ... Your get four fajita rolls and four other ingredients to help take the meal to even higher heights! Guac,jalapeños ,sour cream and some salsa which I hated! Sad times ... Over all a great evening and it was 2 for one so yay even better!	so       i was going about my business when my friend notified me that las iguanas had some kind of tuesday fajita deal going on  she had me at tuesday we booked a table to be safe as i know that after work hours london commuters turn into hungry beasts  long story short we ordered the chicken and prawn fajita      bang bang into the rooooooom  flavourville   both were so yummy  i was a little surprised i won t lie    didn t expect the flavours to hit me so hard on a tuesday like that i didn t get to try their cocktail menu as i have a terrible cold    but i did opt for red wine    the merlot was surprisingly nice  a lot of surprises that night haha     your get four fajita rolls and four other ingredients to help take the meal to even higher heights  guac jalape os  sour cream and some salsa which i hated  sad times     over all a great evening and it was 2 for one so yay even better 
1349	2.0	Ok, I see people here enjoying drinks, so it's probably an ok bar. For the food, however, quite disappointing.  Sad wilted salad, everything oversalted, the mac & cheese was so bad my 8 year old wouldn't eat it. (How do you ruin mac & cheese?  That takes some doing.)  Perhaps the food is just for folks too drunk to care. If you're sober, give it a pass.	ok  i see people here enjoying drinks  so it s probably an ok bar  for the food  however  quite disappointing   sad wilted salad  everything oversalted  the mac   cheese was so bad my 8 year old wouldn t eat it   how do you ruin mac   cheese   that takes some doing    perhaps the food is just for folks too drunk to care  if you re sober  give it a pass 
1350	5.0	So I've been meaning to come to this place for like forever and when I saw they had a deal going on and I was damn let me get some of that! I'd already made plans with a friend, so I won her her over with the promise of a Mexican feast and lots of guac! When we arrived the place, I was shocked by how big the place actually was! It massive once you go downstairs, and we got given a really nice table in the corner, plenty of space for a good convo and not to get squashed.The food was ridiculous! So good! We both got fajitas.. I was craving seafood, so I went for the prawns and she chose the chicken. Both were cooked to perfection. They were served with salsa, guac, jalapeñoes  and sour cream. The salsa wasn't my favourite, but the rest were delicious. Drinks wise, I was feeling a cocktail, but my friend was sick so lead the way and ordered red wine, so I was tempted to join. I got a juicy Malbec, which was light and easy to drink. She opted for the Rioja, which was a bit more spicy.All in all, so impressed by this place. I can't wait to come back and check out more of the menu.	so i ve been meaning to come to this place for like forever and when i saw they had a deal going on and i was damn let me get some of that  i d already made plans with a friend  so i won her her over with the promise of a mexican feast and lots of guac  when we arrived the place  i was shocked by how big the place actually was  it massive once you go downstairs  and we got given a really nice table in the corner  plenty of space for a good convo and not to get squashed the food was ridiculous  so good  we both got fajitas   i was craving seafood  so i went for the prawns and she chose the chicken  both were cooked to perfection  they were served with salsa  guac  jalape oes  and sour cream  the salsa wasn t my favourite  but the rest were delicious  drinks wise  i was feeling a cocktail  but my friend was sick so lead the way and ordered red wine  so i was tempted to join  i got a juicy malbec  which was light and easy to drink  she opted for the rioja  which was a bit more spicy all in all  so impressed by this place  i can t wait to come back and check out more of the menu 
1351	3.0	Las iguanas is one of those chains that I visit, like and then don't go again for ages, simply because there's so many other places to go to. However I was quite happy to get the chance to go again, as I mentioned it to my colleagues and they agreed (they know by now that my obsession with yelp is here to stay).Anyway, we went in, got seated and ordered our drinks. I do have to mention that one of my colleagues got a dirty (kinda mouldy) cup that we returned. The staff apologised about it and mentioned that it happens some times. It has not happened to me before but ok... Nevertheless, we ordered our food and it came shortly after. I had the chicken burrito from the lunch menu and the mushroom starter. The mushrooms were great but the chicken in the burrito was a bit dry. I did feel quite full afterwards and only paid about £9 for the food so it is quite good value for money, even if the quality has room for improvement. My colleagues who had the half chicken said its not as good as Nando's and the really spicy one was not as spicy as they thought but still good value for money in terms of portion sizes.Since I personally have had a good experience with the venue in the past I would like to think that the few mishaps of this visit were an exception and I would go back again, but in general I think wagamama is a better alternative.If you are in the area I would recommend their cocktail happy hour but there are some better places to go for food.	las iguanas is one of those chains that i visit  like and then don t go again for ages  simply because there s so many other places to go to  however i was quite happy to get the chance to go again  as i mentioned it to my colleagues and they agreed  they know by now that my obsession with yelp is here to stay  anyway  we went in  got seated and ordered our drinks  i do have to mention that one of my colleagues got a dirty  kinda mouldy  cup that we returned  the staff apologised about it and mentioned that it happens some times  it has not happened to me before but ok    nevertheless  we ordered our food and it came shortly after  i had the chicken burrito from the lunch menu and the mushroom starter  the mushrooms were great but the chicken in the burrito was a bit dry  i did feel quite full afterwards and only paid about  9 for the food so it is quite good value for money  even if the quality has room for improvement  my colleagues who had the half chicken said its not as good as nando s and the really spicy one was not as spicy as they thought but still good value for money in terms of portion sizes since i personally have had a good experience with the venue in the past i would like to think that the few mishaps of this visit were an exception and i would go back again  but in general i think wagamama is a better alternative if you are in the area i would recommend their cocktail happy hour but there are some better places to go for food 
1352	3.0	A cousin was visiting London and we decided to hit the Udderbelly festival and then dine at Las Iguanas. I booked us a table for 8:30 and we had to wait a good 10-15 minutes before we got a table. While waiting, we had to actually go ask 2 times and even though the table was ready we weren't called.Decent cocktails...they have quite a few options. Liked the ones with cahaca (of course!) and though El Presidente looked like it would be good one, it was strictly ok. Food was great. We had tapas for starters..loved the prawns and the calamari. Their ciabatta with the gambas reminded me of pao from back home.The mains were good as well. The Xinxim was a huge portion, while the sea bass and chicken were more one-person portions. Lovely aromas and delicious comforting food.We got nice window-side seats at the corner. Nice place.

Wouldn't order the guac again. But everything else was good!

1354	4.0	This is a great spot for a Birthday treat, even better if you signed up for their mailing list!I was taken here the other week and treated by my girlfriend for my Birthday. We were looking for a place close to Southbank that would eb a bit exotic. Las Iguanas fit that criteria perfectly. I am a fan of Mexican food, but never had the opportunity to sample Brazillian food so I was excited for this. There didn't seem to be any reservations but we left my phone number and they called within 15 minutes saying a table was held for us. We are led into the ever expanding interior that is so much larger than outside appearances.We start the evening with a cocktail jug (purple zombie or something similar sounding). We share Pato Taquito and Chicken Wings as starters which are small but increibly powerful in taste. This was followed by Camarao a la Criolla (Prawns in) for my girlfriend and I chose the Cordero (boneless lamb in sweet orange and tamarind glaze).This meal was incredible.Portion size was reasonable but not what would be considered enormous. But what they lacked in size was instead replaced by overall tastes and aromas. The conbinations of flavours on the lamb was amazing. I do not usually choose lamb, but they were cooked perfectly, soft, and very juicy. To top off the night, I remembered that I have been to Las Iguanas for lunch last year and joined their email newsletter. I had received an email for my Birthday wishing me a Happy Birthday and a free main meal! So with that significnat discount to the total meal we leave feeling like we have incredible value for money and a very pleasant experience. In terms of atmosphere, the restaurant on the Southbank is obviously very busy and this created a great lively mood for a Thursday evening.To conclude, we were treated to great cocktails, great starts, even better Brazilian main courses and a free main course for my Birthday!I enjoyed the meal so much, I have started my fitness campaign to join the GB Olympic squad so I get a free trip to Rio in 2016!!	this is a great spot for a birthday treat  even better if you signed up for their mailing list i was taken here the other week and treated by my girlfriend for my birthday  we were looking for a place close to southbank that would eb a bit exotic  las iguanas fit that criteria perfectly  i am a fan of mexican food  but never had the opportunity to sample brazillian food so i was excited for this  there didn t seem to be any reservations but we left my phone number and they called within 15 minutes saying a table was held for us  we are led into the ever expanding interior that is so much larger than outside appearances we start the evening with a cocktail jug  purple zombie or something similar sounding   we share pato taquito and chicken wings as starters which are small but increibly powerful in taste  this was followed by camarao a la criolla  prawns in  for my girlfriend and i chose the cordero  boneless lamb in sweet orange and tamarind glaze  this meal was incredible portion size was reasonable but not what would be considered enormous  but what they lacked in size was instead replaced by overall tastes and aromas  the conbinations of flavours on the lamb was amazing  i do not usually choose lamb  but they were cooked perfectly  soft  and very juicy  to top off the night  i remembered that i have been to las iguanas for lunch last year and joined their email newsletter  i had received an email for my birthday wishing me a happy birthday and a free main meal  so with that significnat discount to the total meal we leave feeling like we have incredible value for money and a very pleasant experience  in terms of atmosphere  the restaurant on the southbank is obviously very busy and this created a great lively mood for a thursday evening to conclude  we were treated to great cocktails  great starts  even better brazilian main courses and a free main course for my birthday i enjoyed the meal so much  i have started my fitness campaign to join the gb olympic squad so i get a free trip to rio in 2016  
1355	2.0	I visited Las Iguanas with two friends to celebrate my birthday and had a disappointing experience. The kitchen had lost its gas supply so a limited menu was on offer - however I won't hold this against the restaurant as they did warn us beforehand and were still able to offer a good range of dishes.Unfortunately when we received our food (I had the vegetarian burrito), it was both dry and bland - a far cry from the wholesome, tasty comfort food we were looking for at Las Iguanas. In addition the service was poor - our drinks did not arrive for a long time, and when we asked the serving staff for our cocktails, we were told our order had been lost..Overall not a great experience, and I'll probably choose an alternative chain next time I'm looking for Mexican / Brazilian comfort food.	i visited las iguanas with two friends to celebrate my birthday and had a disappointing experience  the kitchen had lost its gas supply so a limited menu was on offer   however i won t hold this against the restaurant as they did warn us beforehand and were still able to offer a good range of dishes unfortunately when we received our food  i had the vegetarian burrito   it was both dry and bland   a far cry from the wholesome  tasty comfort food we were looking for at las iguanas  in addition the service was poor   our drinks did not arrive for a long time  and when we asked the serving staff for our cocktails  we were told our order had been lost  overall not a great experience  and i ll probably choose an alternative chain next time i m looking for mexican   brazilian comfort food 
1356	3.0	We tried the south bank London on a Wednesday for some food now Being a lover of picky teas we always opt for the taps selection and it never fails to disappoint however the reason behind the 3 stars is simple the venue is too small to host happy hours on cocktails and serve food. After you India jones your way through the very large crowed bar to try and attempt to make your way to the table you are then left with either a rock hard chair to sit on or a well padded seat, We tend to pick 5 tapas and and extraSide so 6 dishes at the most by time these are places on your table with the twoSide plates the candle the menus the salt and pepper and your glass of whatever, you literally find those Tetris skills coming into good use. This is also avoiding people's bums bumping your table as they pass you. We also had to wait 45 mins to be served our food and 30 mins to be served our pudding which we didn't take any chances and asked for the bill straight Away before the service team disappeared forAnother 40mins. On top of all this you also have the noise from trains from the above line/ station running over head in competition with the music they try to lay to drowned it out. In a nutshell if you don't mind a dead bum a constant rhythm of boom boom boom and a very popular buy one get one free cocktail then this is your place.	we tried the south bank london on a wednesday for some food now being a lover of picky teas we always opt for the taps selection and it never fails to disappoint however the reason behind the 3 stars is simple the venue is too small to host happy hours on cocktails and serve food  after you india jones your way through the very large crowed bar to try and attempt to make your way to the table you are then left with either a rock hard chair to sit on or a well padded seat  we tend to pick 5 tapas and and extraside so 6 dishes at the most by time these are places on your table with the twoside plates the candle the menus the salt and pepper and your glass of whatever  you literally find those tetris skills coming into good use  this is also avoiding people s bums bumping your table as they pass you  we also had to wait 45 mins to be served our food and 30 mins to be served our pudding which we didn t take any chances and asked for the bill straight away before the service team disappeared foranother 40mins  on top of all this you also have the noise from trains from the above line  station running over head in competition with the music they try to lay to drowned it out  in a nutshell if you don t mind a dead bum a constant rhythm of boom boom boom and a very popular buy one get one free cocktail then this is your place

Right next to the London Eye and with a fantastic view of Big Ben and Parliament, the location itself is a must for anyone who's visiting the UK.As a small chain, each location of Las Iguanas has this fun, beachy, 60's inspired ambiance that makes eating there an experience. While the decor at the Spitalfield Market is my favorite, this location is cute as well. The restaurant boasts an extensive and delicious selection of margaritas (the coconut one is my personal favorite) as well as a menu that appeals to both meat-eaters and vegetarians. I eat meat; however, I always opt for the butternut squash enchiladas. Each dish is quite filling on its own; however, I would recommend splitting some appetizers with your dining guests (you can either select three starters for 15 pounds or five for 24 pounds). I must say that the menu has changed since I started eating at Las Iguanas. Their ""Cha Cha Chorizo"" was a fantastic starter, and has since been eliminated from the menu.Overall, an affordable, aesthetically-pleasing Mexican restaurant that will  leave you satiated and satisfied."	i travel to london frequently to visit family  and las iguanas on royal festival hall is a must go every time i visit  right next to the london eye and with a fantastic view of big ben and parliament  the location itself is a must for anyone who s visiting the uk as a small chain  each location of las iguanas has this fun  beachy  60 s inspired ambiance that makes eating there an experience  while the decor at the spitalfield market is my favorite  this location is cute as well  the restaurant boasts an extensive and delicious selection of margaritas  the coconut one is my personal favorite  as well as a menu that appeals to both meat eaters and vegetarians  i eat meat  however  i always opt for the butternut squash enchiladas  each dish is quite filling on its own  however  i would recommend splitting some appetizers with your dining guests  you can either select three starters for 15 pounds or five for 24 pounds   i must say that the menu has changed since i started eating at las iguanas  their  cha cha chorizo  was a fantastic starter  and has since been eliminated from the menu overall  an affordable  aesthetically pleasing mexican restaurant that will  leave you satiated and satisfied

To me that sounded like an avocado and cilantro feast so I was defenitely up for it.I passed the time with a classic Margarita until our party was complete and then craved the Cranberry & Avocado Salad. Sprinkled with candied almonds, the salad was a bit too heavy and sweet. Although there wasn't much on the plate, I didn't feel the need to finish it up.My friends were happy with their Mexican comfort food and although I prefer smaller, more unique restaurants, I might come again some day.	my flatmate loves south american food and invited us to join her for a dinner at las iguanas  to me that sounded like an avocado and cilantro feast so i was defenitely up for it i passed the time with a classic margarita until our party was complete and then craved the cranberry   avocado salad  sprinkled with candied almonds  the salad was a bit too heavy and sweet  although there wasn t much on the plate  i didn t feel the need to finish it up my friends were happy with their mexican comfort food and although i prefer smaller  more unique restaurants  i might come again some day 
1359	3.0	I've been to Las Iguanas before and although the food isn't amazing you can't go wrong with a burrito or fajitas! Also their cocktail menu is good although all are very sweet!Recently went for dinner with 3 friends and was quite impressed with the menu. There had been a lot of change and lots of tasty looking things. My friends both had chilli; one beef and one pumpkin. Both enjoyed however I don't think it is anything to shout about. I had a roasted butternut squash, cheese and spinach enchiladas which was really nice. Came with refried beans (wahacas are better) and quite bland rice. We also shared cassava fries. Ok but would go for sweet potato fries or plantain next time! Overall a nice evening - we sat outside on a Friday evening so nice ambience. The service was quite slow however we were in no rush so it was fine.Would return with a group of friends if craving Mexican however there are other restaurants in London I would pick over this!	i ve been to las iguanas before and although the food isn t amazing you can t go wrong with a burrito or fajitas  also their cocktail menu is good although all are very sweet recently went for dinner with 3 friends and was quite impressed with the menu  there had been a lot of change and lots of tasty looking things  my friends both had chilli  one beef and one pumpkin  both enjoyed however i don t think it is anything to shout about  i had a roasted butternut squash  cheese and spinach enchiladas which was really nice  came with refried beans  wahacas are better  and quite bland rice  we also shared cassava fries  ok but would go for sweet potato fries or plantain next time  overall a nice evening   we sat outside on a friday evening so nice ambience  the service was quite slow however we were in no rush so it was fine would return with a group of friends if craving mexican however there are other restaurants in london i would pick over this 
1360	2.0	I usually love Las Iguanas as a chain, but the reason I am not checking in here, in keeping with the theme of the restaurant my phone also had no service. Firstly our booking was mixed up and so they gave away our table. When I proved that we had a booking for 11 at 18.30 not 18.00 they found us a table for 10 and then we had one person standing for 20 mons until they found us another seat. We waited 45 mins for our cocktails which was probably because we were a large order and in the happy hour, but when they arrived they had mixed up the order. Our starters arrived before our drinks and the starters were good, but spicy and the tap water we ordered for the table didnt arrive until after our mains. We had to send three mains back, not inculding the veggy burger they assumed we had ordered, because they had mixed up the style of burger or over-cooked the steak to beyond edible. The staff didn't come to check on us until they finally delivered our water. All in all this is the worst Las Iguanas experience I have ever had. I won't be returning again, but as it is situated in a tourist trap I doubt that would matter. If you are a tourist and thinking of coming here, don't there are more interesting and better places nearby.	i usually love las iguanas as a chain  but the reason i am not checking in here  in keeping with the theme of the restaurant my phone also had no service  firstly our booking was mixed up and so they gave away our table  when i proved that we had a booking for 11 at 18 30 not 18 00 they found us a table for 10 and then we had one person standing for 20 mons until they found us another seat  we waited 45 mins for our cocktails which was probably because we were a large order and in the happy hour  but when they arrived they had mixed up the order  our starters arrived before our drinks and the starters were good  but spicy and the tap water we ordered for the table didnt arrive until after our mains  we had to send three mains back  not inculding the veggy burger they assumed we had ordered  because they had mixed up the style of burger or over cooked the steak to beyond edible  the staff didn t come to check on us until they finally delivered our water  all in all this is the worst las iguanas experience i have ever had  i won t be returning again  but as it is situated in a tourist trap i doubt that would matter  if you are a tourist and thinking of coming here  don t there are more interesting and better places nearby 
1361	2.0	I've been there two days ago and received the worse service ever. When we sat down, no one came to serve us for like 30min. After we've been served, we had to wait more than 25min just to get our drinks on the table that were already done (just no one bother to bring ) so we had to ask for them. It wasn't even that busy.The food was great tho. Rather than that, waiting for nearly an hour to get something really exhausted us.

1362	4.0	The first drink my friend and I had was a passion fruit champagne drink. It was okay. I could taste more mango than passion fruit. It was a 2 for 1 at like 9pm lol. Then we both wanted to try the passion fruit caipirinha. The bartender was very passionate about it according to my friend. Telling him the story behind it. The drink reminds me of a margarita. Not a fan of margaritas. Too limey. The drink was impossible to drink due to the passion fruit getting stuck in the straw lol. It was very different. I would love to come back though.	the first drink my friend and i had was a passion fruit champagne drink  it was okay  i could taste more mango than passion fruit  it was a 2 for 1 at like 9pm lol  then we both wanted to try the passion fruit caipirinha  the bartender was very passionate about it according to my friend  telling him the story behind it  the drink reminds me of a margarita  not a fan of margaritas  too limey  the drink was impossible to drink due to the passion fruit getting stuck in the straw lol  it was very different  i would love to come back though 
1363	3.0	I've only been here for drinks. I've tried to come here for dinner on a Friday night once and it was a 2 hour wait! (Thanks, but no thanks.)The inside has a Latin theme, but the decor reminds me of a big chain restaurant so to be honest it didn't appeal to me. There is also a large seating area outside that I'm sure would be lovely in the summertime.Anyway their USP for me is happy hour. 2 for 1. Honestly I can't complain about 2 for 1, so I would definitely return!	i ve only been here for drinks  i ve tried to come here for dinner on a friday night once and it was a 2 hour wait   thanks  but no thanks  the inside has a latin theme  but the decor reminds me of a big chain restaurant so to be honest it didn t appeal to me  there is also a large seating area outside that i m sure would be lovely in the summertime anyway their usp for me is happy hour  2 for 1  honestly i can t complain about 2 for 1  so i would definitely return 
1364	4.0	We ended up in Las Iguanas when we were looking for food on the Southbank. We were told the wait for a table for two would be half an hour so we grabbed a couple of cocktails at the bar. It always seems busy in Las Iguanas but especially as we went on a Friday night. Cocktails were ok (my friend had a mojito and I had a strawberry dacquiri) but I've had much better for the same price elsewhere. The dacquiri was a little bit sharp for me even though I happily eat slices of lemon! The wait for a table ended up being near to 45mins so we wish we'd ordered nachos to start to eat in the bar first, which a couple next to us had done. When our number came up we were shown to a table and I have to say that I was impressed with the staff. They were friendly and calm despite it being so busy. So often in chain restaurants I find the staff aren't always like this so I really noticed it.We had nachos to start then I had pollo con chorizo and my friend had a burrito. The nachos could have done with a bit more cheese but the guacamole was good and the tortilla crisps were really tasty. My chicken and chorizo was delicious and flavoursome but I would have liked more meat in it and less rice on the side (although I shouldn't really complain about being given too much!). The portion sizes were good and it was reasonable value. My friend enjoyed get burrito but didn't manage to finish it as it was pretty big.I've had tapas here before, but it's better in groups so you can get more variety of dishes. Overall a good chain restaurant. I've not been to South America so can't compare the food for authenticity but it tasted good to me.	we ended up in las iguanas when we were looking for food on the southbank  we were told the wait for a table for two would be half an hour so we grabbed a couple of cocktails at the bar  it always seems busy in las iguanas but especially as we went on a friday night  cocktails were ok  my friend had a mojito and i had a strawberry dacquiri  but i ve had much better for the same price elsewhere  the dacquiri was a little bit sharp for me even though i happily eat slices of lemon  the wait for a table ended up being near to 45mins so we wish we d ordered nachos to start to eat in the bar first  which a couple next to us had done  when our number came up we were shown to a table and i have to say that i was impressed with the staff  they were friendly and calm despite it being so busy  so often in chain restaurants i find the staff aren t always like this so i really noticed it we had nachos to start then i had pollo con chorizo and my friend had a burrito  the nachos could have done with a bit more cheese but the guacamole was good and the tortilla crisps were really tasty  my chicken and chorizo was delicious and flavoursome but i would have liked more meat in it and less rice on the side  although i shouldn t really complain about being given too much    the portion sizes were good and it was reasonable value  my friend enjoyed get burrito but didn t manage to finish it as it was pretty big i ve had tapas here before  but it s better in groups so you can get more variety of dishes  overall a good chain restaurant  i ve not been to south america so can t compare the food for authenticity but it tasted good to me

1367	3.0	I'm surprised by people's enthusiasm for this place if I'm honest. My sum up would be: mediocre food at tourist prices, and weird cocktails. This is the second time I've been here and failed to be impressed. Nothing was terrible and the service was friendly. But the food didn't live up to the fantastic sounding descriptions in the menu - I had a brazilian chicken number which sounded incredible, but turned up looking like a canteen curry and sounded like something i could probably throw together given a can of coconut milk. It was tasty, but I was expecting more - although the pink pickled onions were lovely. My friend had a similar experience. At £13 each those dishes weren't cheap either. The fajitas which went past us looked to be nice and substantial but with Wahaca just down the street and i'd walk the extra few metres: Las Iguanas is mex-lite, I think.  We only tried one cocktail, the coconut margarita, and it was just plain odd.  Like 2 different drinks in one. The drinks prices, to be fair, are quite reasonable but the bar space is cramped as the wait for tables can be long. Convenient and by no means terrible but I'd recommend a wander around the South Bank before you commit...	i m surprised by people s enthusiasm for this place if i m honest  my sum up would be  mediocre food at tourist prices  and weird cocktails  this is the second time i ve been here and failed to be impressed  nothing was terrible and the service was friendly  but the food didn t live up to the fantastic sounding descriptions in the menu   i had a brazilian chicken number which sounded incredible  but turned up looking like a canteen curry and sounded like something i could probably throw together given a can of coconut milk  it was tasty  but i was expecting more   although the pink pickled onions were lovely  my friend had a similar experience  at  13 each those dishes weren t cheap either  the fajitas which went past us looked to be nice and substantial but with wahaca just down the street and i d walk the extra few metres  las iguanas is mex lite  i think   we only tried one cocktail  the coconut margarita  and it was just plain odd   like 2 different drinks in one  the drinks prices  to be fair  are quite reasonable but the bar space is cramped as the wait for tables can be long  convenient and by no means terrible but i d recommend a wander around the south bank before you commit   
1368	4.0	Las Iguanas. My favourite. Where to begin? This was one of the highlights of my birthday, food and drinks at this fabulous restaurant with the Englishman. The wait was ridiculously long and we ended up waiting much longer than we were advised. Usually that's fine as you wait around the bar. However, it was a serious wait to get drinks as it was so packed and congested around the bar. The Englishman raised the issue with the staff who were very courteous and seeing how it was my birthday and we had to wait for soooooooo long, they very kindly offered us happy hour all night. Amazing! 2 for 1 on drinks all night. The drinks at Las Iguanas are delicious! My favourite is the raspberry caiprinhas, what a dream. The food is delicious! Las Iguanas is definitely worth checking out if not for the drinks alone.  Tip: Check out other locations away from tourist traps for less of a wait to get in. I took a star off because of the wait, but the staff didn't let it ruin our night out and the dining area is a bit too dark for eating.	las iguanas  my favourite  where to begin  this was one of the highlights of my birthday  food and drinks at this fabulous restaurant with the englishman  the wait was ridiculously long and we ended up waiting much longer than we were advised  usually that s fine as you wait around the bar  however  it was a serious wait to get drinks as it was so packed and congested around the bar  the englishman raised the issue with the staff who were very courteous and seeing how it was my birthday and we had to wait for soooooooo long  they very kindly offered us happy hour all night  amazing  2 for 1 on drinks all night  the drinks at las iguanas are delicious  my favourite is the raspberry caiprinhas  what a dream  the food is delicious  las iguanas is definitely worth checking out if not for the drinks alone   tip  check out other locations away from tourist traps for less of a wait to get in  i took a star off because of the wait  but the staff didn t let it ruin our night out and the dining area is a bit too dark for eating

1370	4.0	Every time I walked past this place for some reason I thought it was a generic European restaurant. Despite it's name and decore, it had never tempted me in based on that incorrect assumption. A friend brought me and the Mrs here after a trip to the Wonderground, it was heaving. The bar was busy and the restaurant full from what we could see. Three is not the magic number when it comes to restaurant seating but we were seated within minutes by the extrovert and friendly hostess. The cocktail list was expansive and there was a great choice of tequila (for me) and non-alcoholic cocktails (for the oldies).  Great timing, Happy Hour, BOGOF. It was a tough choice, I love Mexican food. There were the standard fajitas and some surprises there. Good Vegetarian choices for mains and deserts. The service was fast for the size of the restaurant and how full it was. Our waitress was friendly and up beat and got a big tip from us. Downside.... Christmas tree, in SEPTEMBER. Loose a star for that. Defiantly would recommend if you want a decent meal after a stroll along the river.	every time i walked past this place for some reason i thought it was a generic european restaurant  despite it s name and decore  it had never tempted me in based on that incorrect assumption  a friend brought me and the mrs here after a trip to the wonderground  it was heaving  the bar was busy and the restaurant full from what we could see  three is not the magic number when it comes to restaurant seating but we were seated within minutes by the extrovert and friendly hostess  the cocktail list was expansive and there was a great choice of tequila  for me  and non alcoholic cocktails  for the oldies    great timing  happy hour  bogof  it was a tough choice  i love mexican food  there were the standard fajitas and some surprises there  good vegetarian choices for mains and deserts  the service was fast for the size of the restaurant and how full it was  our waitress was friendly and up beat and got a big tip from us  downside     christmas tree  in september  loose a star for that  defiantly would recommend if you want a decent meal after a stroll along the river

1372	2.0	I find this chain really overrated and disappointing but other people seem to rave about it. I've only been to this branch once and that was enough, because of its location - on the Southbank and close to Waterloo Station - it's always packed and full of tourists and I think the service is slow; surly and pretty poor. The food was okay when I went but nothing to write home about, the drinks especially the cocktails were good but again, there are plenty of other restaurants that deliver more for your money and appetite!	i find this chain really overrated and disappointing but other people seem to rave about it  i ve only been to this branch once and that was enough  because of its location   on the southbank and close to waterloo station   it s always packed and full of tourists and i think the service is slow  surly and pretty poor  the food was okay when i went but nothing to write home about  the drinks especially the cocktails were good but again  there are plenty of other restaurants that deliver more for your money and appetite 
1373	3.0	"Las Iguanas - how the mighty have fallen. When i first visited, I gave you 4 stars. After many more visits, I gave 5. But after my last 3 visits, you get downgraded to 3. Why? Because you keep changing what is good!Ever since I first started going to Las Iguanas, the hosts/hostess/greeters/whatever you wish to call them have always been crap. Rude, or non-English speaking, or just unavailable. They seem to have gotten worse of late. A few months back I wanted to meet up here for dinner with friends. We had a day and time in mind. So I tried to make reservations. There were 4 in our party. We were told we couldn't book for less than 5 people, but were told that they ""keep 1/3 of the restaurant available for walk-ins"". I called back and fibbed and said we had 5 as we really wanted to make sure we could have a nice night out. Upon arrival we were told they ""needed the table back"" in 1h45m. What?!  After about an hour (with slow, but polite, service) we kept being reminded that we needed to hurry it along. In the end, we took our drinks and desserts and moved to some empty seats outside. We watched as ""our"" table remained empty for nearly 40 minutes.After that occasion, at the request of my bf's mum, we returned this weekend. Again, I wasn't allowed to book a table for 3. Again I was promised that ""1/3 of the restaurant is kept free."" We got there and were told by the VERY rude host that there was a table ""right now"" but we had to ""give it back in 1h40m."" We knew we wanted to have drinks and then dinner, so asked if there was something available later. ""No - I have a table for you now, but we're fully booked the rest of the night."" I pointed out to him that I was told I couldn't book for less than 5 people. ""That's right,"" he said. ""But you have no space for walk-ins *later*?"" I asked. ""No. You can have the table now, but we're fully booked.""  (So much for the ""1/3 open"" policy). We decided this was better than nothing and took the table. When he sat us he told us we now had to be finished in ""1h30m"". It was 30 minutes before we were served our drinks. Hopes were low. In the end, we weren't rushed away. We stayed for just over 2 hours. The restaurant was slow. MANY MANY tables, both small and large, were open when we left. So either we were flat out lied to by the host, or gobs of people cancelled their reservations. The other downfall is the drinks and tapas menus. They keep shrinking and/or the best items disappear or change description greatly. The introduction last year of the taco sharing platter is a great one, but other than that, Las Iguanas on the whole is going downhill. I still enjoy the food. And the waiters and waitresses, while slower than molasses in January, tend to be competent and kind. But the feel of the place isn't the laid back Latin of 3 years ago.

1374	4.0	A spontaneous night on the Southbank landed us in Las Iguanas. I was sceptical because I think it would be a chain with mediocre-y food but I was proven to be wrong. We had to wait a loooooong time, much longer than advised, but I was impressed that the management recognised this by giving us happy hour all night.

Four stars.	a spontaneous night on the southbank landed us in las iguanas  i was sceptical because i think it would be a chain with mediocre y food but i was proven to be wrong  we had to wait a loooooong time  much longer than advised  but i was impressed that the management recognised this by giving us happy hour all night  and true to form  it was happy all night  as the food was actually really good  the tacos were fantastic and so were the enchiladas  we left merry and drunk for a very reasonable price  four stars 
1375	4.0	I really really like this place - two for one cocktails every day 12-7pm will always win fondness in my mind (only on a small selection mind you)The small dishes selection is a great deal (5 for £22.50) - we had 10 dishes between 5 which was by far enough.  The food is fresh and always tasty with a great mexican - style feel.  One  of our dishes came out late and without asking it was taken off our bill, very impressed.  In general the service has always been good here (although the main desk aren't always the most smiley....) however it should be given they automatically add 12.5% service onto food bills - I'm not a fan of this, I always tip but like to decide my own amount please!!One downside, it feels a bit chain-y and is always rammed (probably because it is a chain! and is in one of the most touristy places in London)Top Tips;1 - Long island iced tea (most alcholic cocktail on most menus!)2 - The small dishes selection3 - Shredded beef on your nachos	i really really like this place   two for one cocktails every day 12 7pm will always win fondness in my mind  only on a small selection mind you the small dishes selection is a great deal  5 for  22 50    we had 10 dishes between 5 which was by far enough   the food is fresh and always tasty with a great mexican   style feel   one  of our dishes came out late and without asking it was taken off our bill  very impressed   in general the service has always been good here  although the main desk aren t always the most smiley      however it should be given they automatically add 12 5  service onto food bills   i m not a fan of this  i always tip but like to decide my own amount please  one downside  it feels a bit chain y and is always rammed  probably because it is a chain  and is in one of the most touristy places in london top tips 1   long island iced tea  most alcholic cocktail on most menus  2   the small dishes selection3   shredded beef on your nachos

1377	3.0	3.5 stars for decent mexican food that's palatable.it's not too expensive here if you have lunch. About £7 for a main, and 1.50 or 2.50 for any add-on lunch size appetizers. Their appetizers are definitely really tasty. We got the soup and the nachos and none of us could stop eating. For entree, I had a taste of the chimichanga and the fish fritas. The chimichanga was okay..the chicken was a bit dry. The Fish fritas are these fried mozzarella looking sticks and it was overcooked and not very good. Service was a bit slow.	3 5 stars for decent mexican food that s palatable it s not too expensive here if you have lunch  about  7 for a main  and 1 50 or 2 50 for any add on lunch size appetizers  their appetizers are definitely really tasty  we got the soup and the nachos and none of us could stop eating  for entree  i had a taste of the chimichanga and the fish fritas  the chimichanga was okay  the chicken was a bit dry  the fish fritas are these fried mozzarella looking sticks and it was overcooked and not very good  service was a bit slow 
1378	2.0	This place is simply mediocre to the extreme.  Yes, I have been there a few times, but that's because I work round the corner and you can always get a table, even for a group.Please, if you're looking to eat, try somewhere else - there are so many better options, even amongst the unimaginative selection of chains on offer around the Festival Hall.  There are some genuinely nice indepedent places within ten-minutes walk if you're happy to head a bit away from the river.Yes, they do 2 for 1 cocktails, but they definitely taste like 2-for-1s: watery, weak and made with cheap ingrediants.  Even their 'signature' caipirinha is poor.The food menu is confused and dull.  They can't quite decide whether they're going for comfort food stodge (burrito - not as good as other comfort-food-stodge places that are way cheaper, like Chipotle) or interesting world cuisine (but all these taste identical anyway).They're evidently very proud of their (pricey) fajitas, but I could make better myself: dry, bad-quality meat mixed with soggy over-seasoned onions and peppers.  Plus, they give you the usual range of things to put in - salsa, guacamole, sour cream etc. - but all in bizarrely miniscule quantities.  And the tortillas were cold by the time they got to us, and evidently weren't freshly made in the first place.The service was friendly enough, but not the speediest or most competent.  It took about fifteen minutes to pay our bill.The place is nicely set out, and really makes the most of its sub-railway placement.  The vibe and music are nice.  But that's really not enough to sell a restaurant.	this place is simply mediocre to the extreme   yes  i have been there a few times  but that s because i work round the corner and you can always get a table  even for a group please  if you re looking to eat  try somewhere else   there are so many better options  even amongst the unimaginative selection of chains on offer around the festival hall   there are some genuinely nice indepedent places within ten minutes walk if you re happy to head a bit away from the river yes  they do 2 for 1 cocktails  but they definitely taste like 2 for 1s  watery  weak and made with cheap ingrediants   even their  signature  caipirinha is poor the food menu is confused and dull   they can t quite decide whether they re going for comfort food stodge  burrito   not as good as other comfort food stodge places that are way cheaper  like chipotle  or interesting world cuisine  but all these taste identical anyway  they re evidently very proud of their  pricey  fajitas  but i could make better myself  dry  bad quality meat mixed with soggy over seasoned onions and peppers   plus  they give you the usual range of things to put in   salsa  guacamole  sour cream etc    but all in bizarrely miniscule quantities   and the tortillas were cold by the time they got to us  and evidently weren t freshly made in the first place the service was friendly enough  but not the speediest or most competent   it took about fifteen minutes to pay our bill the place is nicely set out  and really makes the most of its sub railway placement   the vibe and music are nice   but that s really not enough to sell a restaurant 
1379	4.0	I popped in here with a good mate of mine for a catch up. We had a few beers or ten outside before coming inside. I didn't eat but my friend said the food was good. The beers were good apart from them running out of Corona which is understandable, baring in mind the amount of people that were there. The service however was quite poor. It was difficult to get anyone's attention, again, due to the amount of people there. All in all, I had a good time bar the service.

1380	2.0	Got dragged here last night by our cousins for 'dinner and drinks'. I think the two for one cocktails may have been the main attraction. The experience itself wasn't too bad, our waitress was really super nice and they gave free cake and sung happy birthday to birthday cuz. The hostess who greeted us wasn't great. First she told us there were no tables available for 45 minutes. When she 'found' us a table, which she led us through a half empty dining room to get to, she 'double checked' that we were eating, and said we'd have to vacate the table in two hours. Not great service. The food and drink are awful. The menu is a kind of mash up of Cuban, Brazilian and Mexican-inspired food, but there's always something a bit weird about each dish. Like fish tacos with sweet chilli sauce rather than lime and coriander. The cocktails were weak and tasted of washing up liquid, making the two for one deal slightly less enticing. The food was really expensive for the quality. £15 for chicken fajitas and you have to pay extra for cheese. I just had a salad as the least offensive thing on the menu. It was £10 and was mainly just leaves. I wouldn't go here again.	got dragged here last night by our cousins for  dinner and drinks   i think the two for one cocktails may have been the main attraction  the experience itself wasn t too bad  our waitress was really super nice and they gave free cake and sung happy birthday to birthday cuz  the hostess who greeted us wasn t great  first she told us there were no tables available for 45 minutes  when she  found  us a table  which she led us through a half empty dining room to get to  she  double checked  that we were eating  and said we d have to vacate the table in two hours  not great service  the food and drink are awful  the menu is a kind of mash up of cuban  brazilian and mexican inspired food  but there s always something a bit weird about each dish  like fish tacos with sweet chilli sauce rather than lime and coriander  the cocktails were weak and tasted of washing up liquid  making the two for one deal slightly less enticing  the food was really expensive for the quality   15 for chicken fajitas and you have to pay extra for cheese  i just had a salad as the least offensive thing on the menu  it was  10 and was mainly just leaves  i wouldn t go here again 
1381	4.0	After reading some less than positive reviews about Las Iguanas, I was a little bit worried but we had super food, excellent service and a brilliant time. We booked ahead which is a must and we also arrived quite early at 6pm, so I think this added to our overall good time as we didn't have to wait for our table.	after reading some less than positive reviews about las iguanas  i was a little bit worried but we had super food  excellent service and a brilliant time  we booked ahead which is a must and we also arrived quite early at 6pm  so i think this added to our overall good time as we didn t have to wait for our table 
1382	3.0	Although I love going there because of the area, it is hard to say good things about Las Iguanas.starting with cocktails- I have tried almost everything on drink menu- and nothing really was that impressive- unless you don't care about taste and enjoy sugar and alcohol at any ratio, drinks are really hideous!Food wise, I like that this restaurant have options like vegetarian dishes, Gluten Free, special dishes of the week, etc. nevertheless, you still get cold dishes, easily find granules and stones in your meal, or at the slightest find the taste not up to expectations!Service in one word- RUBBISH- you need to beg for the waitress to look at you!!and after all what was mentioned above, you still have to wait every time between 30-45 minutes to get a chance to eat there!	although i love going there because of the area  it is hard to say good things about las iguanas starting with cocktails  i have tried almost everything on drink menu  and nothing really was that impressive  unless you don t care about taste and enjoy sugar and alcohol at any ratio  drinks are really hideous food wise  i like that this restaurant have options like vegetarian dishes  gluten free  special dishes of the week  etc  nevertheless  you still get cold dishes  easily find granules and stones in your meal  or at the slightest find the taste not up to expectations service in one word  rubbish  you need to beg for the waitress to look at you  and after all what was mentioned above  you still have to wait every time between 30 45 minutes to get a chance to eat there 
1383	4.0	Went with a friend for a pre-theatre meal. We opted for the tapas to share - 5 courses for £22 (before 7pm) which was brilliant - the lamb empanadas were a definite high! We also had the Happy Hour cocktails - two glasses (or pitchers) of the same cocktail (from a choice of 5 alcoholic or 3 virgin). So the final bill was under £30 for the 2 of us (exc service), which we were more than happy with. I would definitely go again to work my way through the tapas menu, although I think that the main menu after 7pm may feel a little costly.	went with a friend for a pre theatre meal  we opted for the tapas to share   5 courses for  22  before 7pm  which was brilliant   the lamb empanadas were a definite high  we also had the happy hour cocktails   two glasses  or pitchers  of the same cocktail  from a choice of 5 alcoholic or 3 virgin   so the final bill was under  30 for the 2 of us  exc service   which we were more than happy with  i would definitely go again to work my way through the tapas menu  although i think that the main menu after 7pm may feel a little costly 
1384	1.0	Came here with a friend while down in London the other week, looking to have a drink and a few things to snack on at the same time. The Nachos (Around £5) were a few chips scattered loosely across the wide white plate. They tasted dry and papery. Some were covered in a thick layer of cheese that had the texture of dried glue and didn't really taste of anything at all. In the middle of plate was a pot where watery canned tomato seeped together with cream and a vague green paste that would be difficult to call guacamole.  The Calamari (also around $5) were equally disappointing. There were four or five small squid which just about covered a (thankfully) smaller plate but still seemed to be taunting our hunger with how few they were. They shared the nachos overwhelming impression of being turned in a microwave until they were warm and slightly soggy. The squid itself was overly chewy so that it stretched out and tasted much like an elastic band when you tried to bite into it. In keeping with their seaside origin they had been rolled around in what tasted like sand - small, grainy breadcrumbs that didn't add any crispness. Only by rolling them around until they were covered in the mayonnaise could you get them to taste of anything at all.  Service was poor too. After a good ten minutes gazing around, at the start eventually I got up myself to collect some menus. There were plenty of staff running about but nobody made any effort to come to us. I then had to get up again to get somebody's attention to order, only to be told that if you sat outside you had to order at the bar. And then I got up a third time because no napkins were brought out with our two finger food dishes.	came here with a friend while down in london the other week  looking to have a drink and a few things to snack on at the same time  the nachos  around  5  were a few chips scattered loosely across the wide white plate  they tasted dry and papery  some were covered in a thick layer of cheese that had the texture of dried glue and didn t really taste of anything at all  in the middle of plate was a pot where watery canned tomato seeped together with cream and a vague green paste that would be difficult to call guacamole   the calamari  also around  5  were equally disappointing  there were four or five small squid which just about covered a  thankfully  smaller plate but still seemed to be taunting our hunger with how few they were  they shared the nachos overwhelming impression of being turned in a microwave until they were warm and slightly soggy  the squid itself was overly chewy so that it stretched out and tasted much like an elastic band when you tried to bite into it  in keeping with their seaside origin they had been rolled around in what tasted like sand   small  grainy breadcrumbs that didn t add any crispness  only by rolling them around until they were covered in the mayonnaise could you get them to taste of anything at all   service was poor too  after a good ten minutes gazing around  at the start eventually i got up myself to collect some menus  there were plenty of staff running about but nobody made any effort to come to us  i then had to get up again to get somebody s attention to order  only to be told that if you sat outside you had to order at the bar  and then i got up a third time because no napkins were brought out with our two finger food dishes 
1385	2.0	I live in San Diego (which is practically Mexico). So I'm judging this in a bit unfair way, but meh, I've had better mexican food. Guacamole was average, the lamb meatballs were tasty, the chorizo-black bean brazilian main dish was pretty good. Patatas bravas were not so good. Mojito was quite poorly prepared. Overall, nice location, ok-ish service, meh-food.	i live in san diego  which is practically mexico   so i m judging this in a bit unfair way  but meh  i ve had better mexican food  guacamole was average  the lamb meatballs were tasty  the chorizo black bean brazilian main dish was pretty good  patatas bravas were not so good  mojito was quite poorly prepared  overall  nice location  ok ish service  meh food 
1386	3.0	Had dinner here on a summery Friday evening. Here's a list of my impressions, in timeline form. - Crow-ded! And nobody's eating. Hope there's seats outside and that the food is good. - Wow, I can barely wiggle to my table, it's so close to the neighbouring ones! - Ooooh! Lots of cocktails. And tortilla chips. Yummy homemade tortilla chips. More please! - Cute waiter. Spanish. (not latin american -their pronunciation differs-. I am very slightly amused) Very nice, and fairly efficient, if in slight headless chicken mode. - Hmm.. Enchiladas or Quesadillas... Enchilada it is! Not rolled at the ends, it makes for an impressive length on my plate. But surrounded as it is in refried beans, it looks like a wooden log floating in a pool of s*. Nonetheless very very good :) - Eating the enchilada I accumulate an onion-bhaji-worthy hill of onion pieces. (I don't like eating too much onion, the flavour's too strong) A tad much, perhaps? - Hill of rice under enchilada is very rich... in uncooked or overcooked rice grains. My teeth hurt and I need to return items from my mouth to the plate somewhat ungracefully. - We dined so late, that I'm still hungry. As a result, the desserts menu intrigues me. There is a chocolate pot that mentions kahlua and mocha custard... I drool, then order. It looks like a glass full of chocolate mousse, but it's much better than that. Me and the boyfriend have a spoon battle in the glass for the most chocolate. NOM! - Waiting for the bill and for paying the bill takes a while, and given the sun has disappeared over the embankment, the chilliness is a potent reminder of wanting to move. Overall: good food, great dessert, average speed service. Cocktails: £6, Enchilada £10, Fajitas £14 (not that much meat, and they hide the veg under it!) Desserts £5. (roughly) Highlight: Location, location, location. Benefiting from delicious sunset light, this place has excellent outdoor seating for chatty summery afternoons. I would never come back here unless it was to sit outside, soak up some sun, and watch the people walk by.	had dinner here on a summery friday evening  here s a list of my impressions  in timeline form    crow ded  and nobody s eating  hope there s seats outside and that the food is good    wow  i can barely wiggle to my table  it s so close to the neighbouring ones    ooooh  lots of cocktails  and tortilla chips  yummy homemade tortilla chips  more please    cute waiter  spanish   not latin american  their pronunciation differs   i am very slightly amused  very nice  and fairly efficient  if in slight headless chicken mode    hmm   enchiladas or quesadillas    enchilada it is  not rolled at the ends  it makes for an impressive length on my plate  but surrounded as it is in refried beans  it looks like a wooden log floating in a pool of s   nonetheless very very good      eating the enchilada i accumulate an onion bhaji worthy hill of onion pieces   i don t like eating too much onion  the flavour s too strong  a tad much  perhaps    hill of rice under enchilada is very rich    in uncooked or overcooked rice grains  my teeth hurt and i need to return items from my mouth to the plate somewhat ungracefully    we dined so late  that i m still hungry  as a result  the desserts menu intrigues me  there is a chocolate pot that mentions kahlua and mocha custard    i drool  then order  it looks like a glass full of chocolate mousse  but it s much better than that  me and the boyfriend have a spoon battle in the glass for the most chocolate  nom    waiting for the bill and for paying the bill takes a while  and given the sun has disappeared over the embankment  the chilliness is a potent reminder of wanting to move  overall  good food  great dessert  average speed service  cocktails   6  enchilada  10  fajitas  14  not that much meat  and they hide the veg under it   desserts  5   roughly  highlight  location  location  location  benefiting from delicious sunset light  this place has excellent outdoor seating for chatty summery afternoons  i would never come back here unless it was to sit outside  soak up some sun  and watch the people walk by 
1387	4.0	I met with a few friends for dinner tonight and we browsed the row of restaurants on Festival Row before settling on Las Iguanas.Firstly, I have to say that the kitchen and waitress were really good when we told them that one of our friends had to catch a train from Waterloo station in just over an hour and they made sure that our starters and main courses were served promptlyAlthough the menu is Latin American, it's mainly dominated by Mexican and Brazilian dishes. Having said that, there were some interesting Brazilian curries on the menu which I've not seen beforeWe had missed the value tapas deal and ordered a selection of starters to share - nachos, calamares (deep fried squid), gambas (prawns) and champinones (mushrooms in chilli and tomato sauce).While the nachos and calamares were quite generic, the gambas and champinones had some kick, which was niceFro main course, the salmon moqueca was a creamy coconut curry, which was quite mild but flavoursome. My cordero - lamb rump - was a bit disappointing as I couldn't really taste the coriander and parsley rub nor the papaya in my salsa. My friend's spring chicken was nicely roasted but served with cold vegetables. The steak fajita was quite genericThe banoffee pie was passable but not enough banana! I did enjoy a virgin apple mojito while my friends shared a nice south American merlot.I did enjoy my evening here but this may not be the most authentic Latin American food you'll find in London.A last bonus was that we spotted Juan Martin del Potro dining here.

1389	3.0	A good latin/mexican/brazillian food outpost in a great location on the Southbank.In my experience, the food was ok to good, but I felt like I wasn't getting great value. We took advantage of a cocktail pitcher to go with dinner for 3 of us. By the time we'd poured the whole jug out we'd barely filled each glass 2/3 full. Woah there, easy on that ice!As for the food, not bad at all, but the portions were stingy. We got some loaded nachos to share and a quesadilla before our mains thinking they'd tide us over. They really didn't and we'd seen them off within 2mins. No joke. My burger seemed like it'd had grown up in a White Castle yet my friend's risotto was about right. The other entree ordered was again on the small side. It's a shame we had to stock up on popcorn afterwards at the IMAX!I've also been here after work on a Friday just for drinks and it has a good atmosphere, especially in the warmer months when you can stand outside. I'm afraid that's all i'll be returning for; not the restaurant.	a good latin mexican brazillian food outpost in a great location on the southbank in my experience  the food was ok to good  but i felt like i wasn t getting great value  we took advantage of a cocktail pitcher to go with dinner for 3 of us  by the time we d poured the whole jug out we d barely filled each glass 2 3 full  woah there  easy on that ice as for the food  not bad at all  but the portions were stingy  we got some loaded nachos to share and a quesadilla before our mains thinking they d tide us over  they really didn t and we d seen them off within 2mins  no joke  my burger seemed like it d had grown up in a white castle yet my friend s risotto was about right  the other entree ordered was again on the small side  it s a shame we had to stock up on popcorn afterwards at the imax i ve also been here after work on a friday just for drinks and it has a good atmosphere  especially in the warmer months when you can stand outside  i m afraid that s all i ll be returning for  not the restaurant

But if you can brave the crowds by the doors taking advantage of the 2-4-1 happy hour in the bar area, you'll find a pretty decent restaurant inside.We only had a half hour wait, which gave us plenty of time to enjoy margaritas and caipirinhas (2-4-1 of course) under the umbrellas outside by the South Bank. Service was good all night, considering how busy they were.The food is so much better than I thought! I was expecting grubby Mexican or half-assed Spanish food. Oh no! Featuring mostly Brazilian dishes, almost all of their options are HEALTHY and delicious. I had grilled chicken, which came with roasted sweet potato and squash pieces, roasted grape tomatoes, and a handful of rocket, plus a choice of sauce (tons of different types of salsa to choose from). I had the papaya mint salsa... MMMMMMMMMMMM. Warning: their guacamole has sour cream in it. Told you Larissa D!Anyway, if you happen to be in the area, say, to catch a gig at Heaven just over Waterloo Bridge, then give Las Iguanas a try. Es muy bueno.	i reeeeeeeeally wasn t expecting much from las iguanas  because every time i have walked past  it s drunken post work clientele annoy the pants off of me  but if you can brave the crowds by the doors taking advantage of the 2 4 1 happy hour in the bar area  you ll find a pretty decent restaurant inside we only had a half hour wait  which gave us plenty of time to enjoy margaritas and caipirinhas  2 4 1 of course  under the umbrellas outside by the south bank  service was good all night  considering how busy they were the food is so much better than i thought  i was expecting grubby mexican or half assed spanish food  oh no  featuring mostly brazilian dishes  almost all of their options are healthy and delicious  i had grilled chicken  which came with roasted sweet potato and squash pieces  roasted grape tomatoes  and a handful of rocket  plus a choice of sauce  tons of different types of salsa to choose from   i had the papaya mint salsa    mmmmmmmmmmmm  warning  their guacamole has sour cream in it  told you larissa d anyway  if you happen to be in the area  say  to catch a gig at heaven just over waterloo bridge  then give las iguanas a try  es muy bueno 
1391	4.0	I labeled Las Iguanas as another Giraffe before I tried it, deciding that the suited city boys drinking cocktails after work as I walked from Waterloo to Embankment weren't worth joining.Until, short of options, I went for dinner. The happy hour accounts for the aforementioned smartarses, but the restaurant has a wholly different feel to it. You are well looked after and the menu is varied, interesting and modest in price. There are plenty of options for carnivores, herbivores, and allergy sufferers, and with a much larger space than it first appears, you don't usually need to wait long to be seated.I've been three times now and enjoyed it every time. That said, I'd recommend the full meals over the tapas options, which are slightly lacking in comparison, both taste-wise and value-wise.Before I make up any more words, I'll leave you to see what you make of it.	i labeled las iguanas as another giraffe before i tried it  deciding that the suited city boys drinking cocktails after work as i walked from waterloo to embankment weren t worth joining until  short of options  i went for dinner  the happy hour accounts for the aforementioned smartarses  but the restaurant has a wholly different feel to it  you are well looked after and the menu is varied  interesting and modest in price  there are plenty of options for carnivores  herbivores  and allergy sufferers  and with a much larger space than it first appears  you don t usually need to wait long to be seated i ve been three times now and enjoyed it every time  that said  i d recommend the full meals over the tapas options  which are slightly lacking in comparison  both taste wise and value wise before i make up any more words  i ll leave you to see what you make of it

Although we did go on a Friday so should have expected this.

1393	4.0	I love, love, love the food in Las Iguanas. I also love the theming and the music but as with all chains, each venue can vary in terms of service and food quality. I headed here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the lunch menu with main meals at just £6.90 - a bargain for the portion of chilli, rice, tortillas and tortilla chips that I got. Until 7pm there is also Buy one get one free on cocktails which I urge you to take advantage of. The bar service we got was hardly with a smile though, I think we caught the barman on a very bad day. He prepared the wrong drink and when we made reference to it he threw the drink (and almost the glass) at the sink with not a word of explanation. With that aside, the food was good. It took a while to come out, but we were served with tortilla chips and guacamole while we waited. Do note though that as this is a busy chain there is a 1.5 hour limit on the tables so don't expect to while away the afternoon here.	i love  love  love the food in las iguanas  i also love the theming and the music but as with all chains  each venue can vary in terms of service and food quality  i headed here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the lunch menu with main meals at just  6 90   a bargain for the portion of chilli  rice  tortillas and tortilla chips that i got  until 7pm there is also buy one get one free on cocktails which i urge you to take advantage of  the bar service we got was hardly with a smile though  i think we caught the barman on a very bad day  he prepared the wrong drink and when we made reference to it he threw the drink  and almost the glass  at the sink with not a word of explanation  with that aside  the food was good  it took a while to come out  but we were served with tortilla chips and guacamole while we waited  do note though that as this is a busy chain there is a 1 5 hour limit on the tables so don t expect to while away the afternoon here 
1394	5.0	Been to all of their London locations, all equally AMAZING. Been going here for years whenever I visit London, it's my favourite restaurant ever. Best mushroom fajitas ever, they are delicious beyond reason. Best nachos ever too, they sprinkle some spices on it that are so darn good. Go during happy hour though because their drinks are pretty expensive, but at least you can buy a pitcher and get one free! Their Long Island iced teas are simply the best. Amazing Latin playlist too, and cool decor.

1395	2.0	No thrills, no creative fresh cuisine even though the menu would try and tell you otherwise as much as I wanted to enjoy the place I just found it poorly executed Latin themed.  Now to be a bit more clear ...Even though they have a happy hour the cocktails are quite poorly made and presented, especially if you are after a old favorite. I always hate writing terrible reviews but nothing really came together for my party the other evening at Las Iguagnas. The starters were anything but fresh and the salsa puts jarred off license salsa to shame. All the street food is not as processed as tex mex but lacked any real flavor and I would have to say we tried both Brazilian curries and it tasted like the curry special at your local pub. I have no other way to say it, poor service and disappointing.	no thrills  no creative fresh cuisine even though the menu would try and tell you otherwise as much as i wanted to enjoy the place i just found it poorly executed latin themed   now to be a bit more clear    even though they have a happy hour the cocktails are quite poorly made and presented  especially if you are after a old favorite  i always hate writing terrible reviews but nothing really came together for my party the other evening at las iguagnas  the starters were anything but fresh and the salsa puts jarred off license salsa to shame  all the street food is not as processed as tex mex but lacked any real flavor and i would have to say we tried both brazilian curries and it tasted like the curry special at your local pub  i have no other way to say it  poor service and disappointing

1397	3.0	The South Bank entry in this London chain of Mexican-ish restaurants. This spot if great as a meeting place, right at the south end of the Jubilee footbridge. It's a good choice for meeting before an arts event in the South Bank Centre, too. It's very large, with many dozens of tables inside, with shiny new decor. Outside are several tables too, with the occasional rumble of trains above your head leaving Charing Cross station. They have good deals on during their noon-7pm happy hour. Several cocktails are 2 for 1, house wines are a few pounds cheaper, and there are several meal deals. The food and drink menu is extensive. It's all a bit chainy for me, though. The only beer on tap is San Miguel. They have several bottles. Good because of its location and size, nothing special otherwise.	the south bank entry in this london chain of mexican ish restaurants  this spot if great as a meeting place  right at the south end of the jubilee footbridge  it s a good choice for meeting before an arts event in the south bank centre  too  it s very large  with many dozens of tables inside  with shiny new decor  outside are several tables too  with the occasional rumble of trains above your head leaving charing cross station  they have good deals on during their noon 7pm happy hour  several cocktails are 2 for 1  house wines are a few pounds cheaper  and there are several meal deals  the food and drink menu is extensive  it s all a bit chainy for me  though  the only beer on tap is san miguel  they have several bottles  good because of its location and size  nothing special otherwise 
1398	3.0	The Southbank branch of this small Latin American chain of restaurants and bars, the wonderful thing about this establishment is it's wonderful position. IF you opt to sit outside on one of the many heated tables, you have a splendid view of the Southbank. There's a happy hour between 5pm and 7pm, where it's 2-4-1 on the extensive cocktail menu; they've gt pretty much everything you could want, and their Long Island Ice Tea's are fantastic. They serve a vast menu of Southern American dishes, the usual fajitas, jambalaya rice but also some great little tapas dishes, their spiced potato's are very nice. Prices are pretty steep, but given the location you're paying for where you are, as much as what you're ingesting. The vast cocktail menu, and long opening hours means this is a popular spot with those looking for a place to drink on the Southbank, and late into the night the place gets very busy, making it fairly hard to get to the bar. A great place to sit with a friend, having a good old chin wag over cocktails, watching the world go by on the Southbank.	the southbank branch of this small latin american chain of restaurants and bars  the wonderful thing about this establishment is it s wonderful position  if you opt to sit outside on one of the many heated tables  you have a splendid view of the southbank  there s a happy hour between 5pm and 7pm  where it s 2 4 1 on the extensive cocktail menu  they ve gt pretty much everything you could want  and their long island ice tea s are fantastic  they serve a vast menu of southern american dishes  the usual fajitas  jambalaya rice but also some great little tapas dishes  their spiced potato s are very nice  prices are pretty steep  but given the location you re paying for where you are  as much as what you re ingesting  the vast cocktail menu  and long opening hours means this is a popular spot with those looking for a place to drink on the southbank  and late into the night the place gets very busy  making it fairly hard to get to the bar  a great place to sit with a friend  having a good old chin wag over cocktails  watching the world go by on the southbank

Also a lovely spot for a late drink post theatre, the crowds have died down by then and you can get a table at the bar easily.	haven t eaten here but the cocktails are great  fantastic location if you can get a table outside in the summer too  also a lovely spot for a late drink post theatre  the crowds have died down by then and you can get a table at the bar easily 
1400	4.0	I had been to quite a few spanish, portuguese and south american places in the last few weeks ... so i was a tad disapointed when my friends selected this one for the sunday dinner. But maybe it was the food, or it might have been the pleasant environment of the south bank, i have ended up feeling good about this meal.We started off with a pitcher of Long Island iced tea. Now i have had long island at many places, but the muddy colour of the drink here was clearly unique. It tasted good though.The food was menu was a mixture of spanish and portuguese and mexican and brazilian food. I ordered a lamb empanada as a starter. It was pretty much a lamb pasty, though the filling was cooked in a latin american style. Very tasty :)For the main course it was ensopado de carne ... a dish of red goat meat curry and rice. The curry wasn't spicy ... a bit sweetish in fact ... but the combination with the rice worked rather well. I was pleased.The service was good. In spite of it being a big restaurant and very crowded when we went in, we didn't have to wait long for anything.In the line of chains that adorn the south bank centre, this is surely one of the better ones, and at 20 pounds per head, one of the reasonably priced ones.	i had been to quite a few spanish  portuguese and south american places in the last few weeks     so i was a tad disapointed when my friends selected this one for the sunday dinner  but maybe it was the food  or it might have been the pleasant environment of the south bank  i have ended up feeling good about this meal we started off with a pitcher of long island iced tea  now i have had long island at many places  but the muddy colour of the drink here was clearly unique  it tasted good though the food was menu was a mixture of spanish and portuguese and mexican and brazilian food  i ordered a lamb empanada as a starter  it was pretty much a lamb pasty  though the filling was cooked in a latin american style  very tasty   for the main course it was ensopado de carne     a dish of red goat meat curry and rice  the curry wasn t spicy     a bit sweetish in fact     but the combination with the rice worked rather well  i was pleased the service was good  in spite of it being a big restaurant and very crowded when we went in  we didn t have to wait long for anything in the line of chains that adorn the south bank centre  this is surely one of the better ones  and at 20 pounds per head  one of the reasonably priced ones 
1401	5.0	4 of us had a lovely Lunch here, the O2 is nice just to visit and wander around the main concourse, lots of bars and restaurants, we've been a few times for gigs/events and both times have eaten at Las Iguanas. They do a great deal on Cocktails at lunchtimes and a couple of Long Island Iced Teas (recommended) and I was starving...Try the XimXim, kind of a curry/Satay feel to it, but lots of extras for a hungry person and it was wonderful. (supposed to be Peles favourite and I can see why) My friends food was just as good, dont have starters, the mains are huge. The drinks are not too expensive and the staff were really great, friendly and attentive. The music was good too. I can highly recommend this place.	4 of us had a lovely lunch here  the o2 is nice just to visit and wander around the main concourse  lots of bars and restaurants  we ve been a few times for gigs events and both times have eaten at las iguanas  they do a great deal on cocktails at lunchtimes and a couple of long island iced teas  recommended  and i was starving   try the ximxim  kind of a curry satay feel to it  but lots of extras for a hungry person and it was wonderful   supposed to be peles favourite and i can see why  my friends food was just as good  dont have starters  the mains are huge  the drinks are not too expensive and the staff were really great  friendly and attentive  the music was good too  i can highly recommend this place

1403	2.0	Great for drinks and parties, but perhaps not so great for Mexican food. When I came to this restaurant it was crowded, and the staff were slow and unhelpful. The food was okay, nothing special, and the portions weren't very big. The overall impression is that due to the amount of traffic Las Iguanas get thanks to the popular South Bank location, nobody cares if you will ever come back. If I were in the area again, I'd rather go to Cubana on Lower Marsh Street (behind Waterloo) where you can get all the cocktails and much more exciting food.	great for drinks and parties  but perhaps not so great for mexican food  when i came to this restaurant it was crowded  and the staff were slow and unhelpful  the food was okay  nothing special  and the portions weren t very big  the overall impression is that due to the amount of traffic las iguanas get thanks to the popular south bank location  nobody cares if you will ever come back  if i were in the area again  i d rather go to cubana on lower marsh street  behind waterloo  where you can get all the cocktails and much more exciting food 
1404	4.0	My wife and I are both new fans of Las Iguanas and decided to check out this one near Waterloo Station. For a Monday evening the restaurant and bar were ridiculously busy and we had to wait around forty minutes for a table. We filled that time with a cheeky cocktail which was rather nice. The dining area here is very busy and crowded. We were squeezed into a table with barely enough elbow room but the food and service more then made up for things. On this occasion we opted to have the taco sharing platter which is sensational and surprisingly large for the price (£12). I'd like to come back here but don't know if this particular restaurant has a 'quiet night' given that even Mondays are busy here. 10/10 for the service	my wife and i are both new fans of las iguanas and decided to check out this one near waterloo station  for a monday evening the restaurant and bar were ridiculously busy and we had to wait around forty minutes for a table  we filled that time with a cheeky cocktail which was rather nice  the dining area here is very busy and crowded  we were squeezed into a table with barely enough elbow room but the food and service more then made up for things  on this occasion we opted to have the taco sharing platter which is sensational and surprisingly large for the price   12   i d like to come back here but don t know if this particular restaurant has a  quiet night  given that even mondays are busy here  10 10 for the service
1405	3.0	It's a fun and buzzy bar but make sure you reserve a table or you're going to end up standing with the crowds as there aren't many bar stools. The drink are reasonably priced (£6) and great on the happy hour 2 4 1. My passionfruit caipirinha was great but the glass was so full of ice I could barely get at it. In Brazil they fill the glass about 2/3 with ice at most. What little I had was nice though. Avoid the Acapulco Cream one at all costs it is repulsive! I also ordered 5 tapas and they were all lukewarm, I probably wouldn't bother getting these again but would just come back for drinks. Bar staff were pleasant though, not always the case in such a busy place and service was pretty fast.	it s a fun and buzzy bar but make sure you reserve a table or you re going to end up standing with the crowds as there aren t many bar stools  the drink are reasonably priced   6  and great on the happy hour 2 4 1  my passionfruit caipirinha was great but the glass was so full of ice i could barely get at it  in brazil they fill the glass about 2 3 with ice at most  what little i had was nice though  avoid the acapulco cream one at all costs it is repulsive  i also ordered 5 tapas and they were all lukewarm  i probably wouldn t bother getting these again but would just come back for drinks  bar staff were pleasant though  not always the case in such a busy place and service was pretty fast 
1406	3.0	The restaurant is located in a really busy spot by South Bank and was absolutely heaving when we visited. We took advantage of the two for one cocktails when we were there which was great. The seating itself is really tight, definately trying to pack as many people in as possible and not mega comfortable. Food was ok, I had the chicken dish which is apprarently a favourite of Pele's when he was growing up.. it was nice enough. I think this place just has that rushed, packed chainy/touristy vibe which I just don't really like - you know they just want to get you out of there as soon as they can!	the restaurant is located in a really busy spot by south bank and was absolutely heaving when we visited  we took advantage of the two for one cocktails when we were there which was great  the seating itself is really tight  definately trying to pack as many people in as possible and not mega comfortable  food was ok  i had the chicken dish which is apprarently a favourite of pele s when he was growing up   it was nice enough  i think this place just has that rushed  packed chainy touristy vibe which i just don t really like   you know they just want to get you out of there as soon as they can

1409	3.0	"Came here in the summer for dinner with 2.5 friends*.  We were seated outside, by the walkway on the Thames and it was a beautiful night. The food were decent portions. I specifically remembered the Paella we ordered because a homeless woman**  had no problem devouring it. Did you just go back and re-read that sentence? My friends and I were enjoying our dinner and having a lovely conversation*** when a homeless woman came by and panhandeled while we were eating our dinner. My friend tenderly said that we didn't have any money for her but that we would have left overs. Sure enough the woman took her hand and started eating off the plates. Then she pointed to the paella my friend was still eating and asked in her lovely east London accent: ""What about that, are you going to eat it?"" and before anyone could answer, her fingers were digging in. No one knew what to say or do so we just sat and stared. By the time she polished off our Paella the waiter saw what was happening and ""shoe-ed"" the woman away. He apologized and said that the woman comes by begging for change often, then left. We all felt awful for this woman and would have loved to giver her our leftovers, if she left any. Maybe we brought it upon ourselves by being unclear as to what ""leftovers"" are. We ordered about 4 dishes (like I said i only remembered the Paella), we were all stuffed... although, I guess I can't speak for the homeless woman. I hope she had enough to eat that night. Our bill was about 75 quid. Not too shabby for a nice restaurant on the Thames. Just be careful not to offer leftovers to anyone until they're actually packed in the doggy bag.*hah, and you were annoyed that you couldn't give establishments half stars on Yelp.** my .5 friend.

1410	2.0	"I must say that I was a little disappointed by Las Iguanas. The food isn't horrible, it's just that it's nothing special at all. If I didn't know better ( not that I do know better ) I would have said that the meals are pre-packed ready meals shipped in and re-heated. For starters I had chorizo braised in rioja. I cook with chorizo all the time at home, being a fan of Spanish cooking and I know that it has tones of flavour. The sauce I had didn't taste much of chorizo or the wine, and should be rich with the taste of both. The starter was ""nice"" but nothing else. I could cook this at home much better. For mains I had the Xim Xim chicken. The chicken was pale white and slightly rubbery - in fact exactly like you would find in a ready meal. The dish described as lime chicken in a peanut/crayfish sauce didn't taste of lime or cray fish or peanuts. The sauce was creamy slightly peanutty. Again, not unpleasent, but not at all great. I have had better ready meals. The green beans I had were raw. Don't get me wrong, I am not one of these boil the veg to death brits. I love my veggies to have crunch and texture, but there is is that and there is raw - my veg was raw. My desert was passion fruit cheese cake which was actually very nice. However, I wouldn't go out to have a meal somewhere for the cheese cake. The staff were business like and professional. They did the job and nothing more. Just like the food. It seems like getting the job done is enough and going the extra mile is not required. The music was far too loud like the place is trying to hard to pretend to be something it's not.

The waitress raushed our drinks order so we could take advantage of the 2 for 2 cocktails offer, great! Even though they had an early evening set menu, we opted for a la carte and had steak, chicken kebabs, prawn curry & steak fajitas between 4 of us, washed down with 2 huge jugs of long island iced tea. Perfect fodder before a night on the town.	we went on a saturday early evening in july  2 couples   it looked there was a fair queue outside but we got to the front very quickly  the waitress raushed our drinks order so we could take advantage of the 2 for 2 cocktails offer  great  even though they had an early evening set menu  we opted for a la carte and had steak  chicken kebabs  prawn curry   steak fajitas between 4 of us  washed down with 2 huge jugs of long island iced tea  perfect fodder before a night on the town

Loads of duck and really tender. We were there on a Sunday night and had a voucher for BOGOF on main course which was excellent and saved as 12 quid. They also had a deal on for BOGOF on there cocktails. I had a Long Island Iced Tea which was great but the Vanilla Mojita was the best cocktail that I have ever tasted in my entire life and I have had quite a few in my time. Even without the deals prices are reasonable as great food and staff and a really wonderful atmosphere.	myself and my husband had a brilliant night here recently  i had the duck fajitas for my main course  after seeing them on masterchef  and they were to die for  loads of duck and really tender  we were there on a sunday night and had a voucher for bogof on main course which was excellent and saved as 12 quid  they also had a deal on for bogof on there cocktails  i had a long island iced tea which was great but the vanilla mojita was the best cocktail that i have ever tasted in my entire life and i have had quite a few in my time  even without the deals prices are reasonable as great food and staff and a really wonderful atmosphere 
1416	5.0	This restaurant is a real gem on the South Bank. Specialising in Latin food and drinks, it has an amazing menu which contains everything you may want from bar snacks (nachos are excellent) and a variety of tapas to delicious main meals (ranging from an amazing brazilian curry to tender steaks and lamb), all at a reasonable price. Best of all is the fantastic cocktail list (the caipirinhas are fabulous) and the fact that on the 5 or 6 occasions I have been, I have always managed to get a table without more than a 10-15 minute wait. That said, it is still busy and vibey without being overcrowded. Definitely worth a visit!	this restaurant is a real gem on the south bank  specialising in latin food and drinks  it has an amazing menu which contains everything you may want from bar snacks  nachos are excellent  and a variety of tapas to delicious main meals  ranging from an amazing brazilian curry to tender steaks and lamb   all at a reasonable price  best of all is the fantastic cocktail list  the caipirinhas are fabulous  and the fact that on the 5 or 6 occasions i have been  i have always managed to get a table without more than a 10 15 minute wait  that said  it is still busy and vibey without being overcrowded  definitely worth a visit 
1417	3.0	beautifully located you may reach las iguanas crossing the bridge form embakment station, that sets you up for all an experience. i must say it is a bit noisy, and i do hate latin music, but appart from that the place is very pleasing, staff is friendly and helpful, which is cool, being the menu as complicated as it is, even for a spanish bloke.take your time, there are a few gems hidden in the menu.the brazilian dishes, xim xim and moqueca resemble a bit the indian curry, but with another concept of flavour. xim xim is a daring and nutty chicken dish...the favourite of pele, according to the menu. moqueca is a salmon dish, based on coriander and coconut that scored high for me.many people will be tempted of fajitas. well, they are great, served in sizzling skillets, with tortillas for you to wrap it, or bunddle it ,depending on your skills. fajitas are a bit expensive, but you get the joy of handling your food ,mexican style.then, some grills and meats. among those, lamb is just cool, a chunky shank to wolf down and not mess up wraping your stuff.last of all, desserts, really really nice, the mascarpone with merengue is delightful. even you can ask for a single scoop of coconut ice cream for the digestion if you had enough. wines and alcohol plentiful. a good place after all. even after the bill, which won't be little	beautifully located you may reach las iguanas crossing the bridge form embakment station  that sets you up for all an experience  i must say it is a bit noisy  and i do hate latin music  but appart from that the place is very pleasing  staff is friendly and helpful  which is cool  being the menu as complicated as it is  even for a spanish bloke take your time  there are a few gems hidden in the menu the brazilian dishes  xim xim and moqueca resemble a bit the indian curry  but with another concept of flavour  xim xim is a daring and nutty chicken dish   the favourite of pele  according to the menu  moqueca is a salmon dish  based on coriander and coconut that scored high for me many people will be tempted of fajitas  well  they are great  served in sizzling skillets  with tortillas for you to wrap it  or bunddle it  depending on your skills  fajitas are a bit expensive  but you get the joy of handling your food  mexican style then  some grills and meats  among those  lamb is just cool  a chunky shank to wolf down and not mess up wraping your stuff last of all  desserts  really really nice  the mascarpone with merengue is delightful  even you can ask for a single scoop of coconut ice cream for the digestion if you had enough  wines and alcohol plentiful  a good place after all  even after the bill  which won t be little
1418	4.0	Absolutely fantastic! The food is delicious, portion sizes are extremely generous, brilliant value for money, excellent atmosphere and happy hour between 5-7pm - what more could you want?! Service is very efficient and friendly! If you want to eat there between 4 and 9:30pm make sure you book, it gets very busy and they quite often don't have 'spare' tables until 10pm on Thursdays/Fridays/Saturdays.

1419	5.0	During my 3-day stay in London I came here for dinner for two nights.  I love this place.  Growing up in San Diego and frequenting the Chicken Pie Shop, I have associated meat pies with home.  Mother Mash has a large assortment of mash, pies, and gravy--you can try so many different combinations.I highly suggest the Angus Steak and the Onion gravy.  DELICIOUS.Staff is lovely here.  Will come here again if I visit and will recommend to my friends.	during my 3 day stay in london i came here for dinner for two nights   i love this place   growing up in san diego and frequenting the chicken pie shop  i have associated meat pies with home   mother mash has a large assortment of mash  pies  and gravy  you can try so many different combinations i highly suggest the angus steak and the onion gravy   delicious staff is lovely here   will come here again if i visit and will recommend to my friends 
1420	4.0	Seems like Monster Mash rolls off the tongue easier than Mother Mash. Perhaps that's why I was a little surprised to see how small and cramped it is in here. Luckily we came for a late lunch and there were only a few patrons around.The ordering situation here is very simple. You can either have two sausages or a pie, with mashed potatoes and gravy. Sausage (£9.50) and a Pie combo (£10.25)We sat in a cozy little wooden booth and shared Classic Mash with Aberdeen Angus Steak Pie and Traditional gravy, and Cheesy Mash with Beef & Guinness sausage, Cumberland pork sausage and Farmer's Gravy.Classic - Natural mash with milk & butter:Ok, but rather gummy, chewy, and denseCheesy - Natural mash with mature cheddar:Ok, but also dense and not very cheesyAberdeen Angus Steak Pie:Good! Chock full of beef chunks and gravy inside the pie. The crust could have been more flaky, but the mashed potatoes and sauces left the crust rather soggy.Beef & Guinness sausage:Good! Very faint alcohol flavorCumberland - Classic British pork with pepper:Good! Very salty, porky flavorTraditional - Simple gravy using juice from sausages and vegetables:Good! Thick, smooth gravy, very savoryFarmer's Gravy - red wine, onion, smoked bacon and mushrooms:Great! Tasty red wine flavor£4.95 Bulmers Original Cider:nice and sweet to complement all the salty foodOverall, the food was good and pretty reasonably priced for a complete meal. Some of the items could use some improvement. If I were a local, I'd probably come back to try other pies and sausages. The service was friendly and the food came fairly quickly. I give Mother Mash a solid 7/10.	seems like monster mash rolls off the tongue easier than mother mash  perhaps that s why i was a little surprised to see how small and cramped it is in here  luckily we came for a late lunch and there were only a few patrons around the ordering situation here is very simple  you can either have two sausages or a pie  with mashed potatoes and gravy  sausage   9 50  and a pie combo   10 25 we sat in a cozy little wooden booth and shared classic mash with aberdeen angus steak pie and traditional gravy  and cheesy mash with beef   guinness sausage  cumberland pork sausage and farmer s gravy classic   natural mash with milk   butter ok  but rather gummy  chewy  and densecheesy   natural mash with mature cheddar ok  but also dense and not very cheesyaberdeen angus steak pie good  chock full of beef chunks and gravy inside the pie  the crust could have been more flaky  but the mashed potatoes and sauces left the crust rather soggy beef   guinness sausage good  very faint alcohol flavorcumberland   classic british pork with pepper good  very salty  porky flavortraditional   simple gravy using juice from sausages and vegetables good  thick  smooth gravy  very savoryfarmer s gravy   red wine  onion  smoked bacon and mushrooms great  tasty red wine flavor 4 95 bulmers original cider nice and sweet to complement all the salty foodoverall  the food was good and pretty reasonably priced for a complete meal  some of the items could use some improvement  if i were a local  i d probably come back to try other pies and sausages  the service was friendly and the food came fairly quickly  i give mother mash a solid 7 10 
1421	3.0	I honestly think most of the food in London are a bit boring and bland. However, Mother Mash is probably 1 of the better food that I consumed that week.Essentially, you have to choose your mash + main (sausages or pies) + gravy. There're about 7 different types of mash, 9 sausages or 7 pies, 5 gravy to choose from.I went with the Classic Mash (milk & butter) + Aberdeen Angus Steak + Traditional Gravy (made of juice from vegetables & sausages). It's quite tasty, hearty and fresh (especially the mash). The portion and price are also quite reasonable.	i honestly think most of the food in london are a bit boring and bland  however  mother mash is probably 1 of the better food that i consumed that week essentially  you have to choose your mash   main  sausages or pies    gravy  there re about 7 different types of mash  9 sausages or 7 pies  5 gravy to choose from i went with the classic mash  milk   butter    aberdeen angus steak   traditional gravy  made of juice from vegetables   sausages   it s quite tasty  hearty and fresh  especially the mash   the portion and price are also quite reasonable

1423	4.0	I came here for the pies and sausages, and for the most point, came out happy. I got the pie with the steak and it tasted like a chicken pot pie stuffed with a pot roast. If that doesn't sound savory I don't know what does. We got this with the champ potatoes, which was pretty good, but it was drenched in a delicious gravy. We also got the traditional sausage with the bubble and squeak potatoes, and I would have to say, the bubble and squeak potatoes is the way to go. It has cabbage and peas in it that really made it delicious. The sausage to me was only alright though. I think my mistake was that I didn't get the one with more spices in it, so it tasted too gamey with just pork. Regardless, the potatoes with the gravy made up for it. Otherwise, soho is a great area and the location is really close to the Piccadilly Circus so it's easy to get to.	i came here for the pies and sausages  and for the most point  came out happy  i got the pie with the steak and it tasted like a chicken pot pie stuffed with a pot roast  if that doesn t sound savory i don t know what does  we got this with the champ potatoes  which was pretty good  but it was drenched in a delicious gravy  we also got the traditional sausage with the bubble and squeak potatoes  and i would have to say  the bubble and squeak potatoes is the way to go  it has cabbage and peas in it that really made it delicious  the sausage to me was only alright though  i think my mistake was that i didn t get the one with more spices in it  so it tasted too gamey with just pork  regardless  the potatoes with the gravy made up for it  otherwise  soho is a great area and the location is really close to the piccadilly circus so it s easy to get to

1425	5.0	The pie was delectable and so was the mashed potatoes! This heavenly goodness was just what I needed on a cold rainy night. I even ordered mushy peas on the side and a salad to have veggies. I would definitely come back again if I visit London again. I'm also writing a review that way I don't forget about this gem.	the pie was delectable and so was the mashed potatoes  this heavenly goodness was just what i needed on a cold rainy night  i even ordered mushy peas on the side and a salad to have veggies  i would definitely come back again if i visit london again  i m also writing a review that way i don t forget about this gem 
1426	5.0	This is my favourite place for mash! We ordered the cheesy mustard mash with pork and chilli sausage and onion gravy (£9.25). It was drowned in gravy which I LOVED and finished all of! It was fun to be able to choose the type of mash, sausage and gravy (build your own mash kind of thing). This was the same for the pies as well. They were really busy on a Sunday evening, but there was a table available so we were seated immediately. We wanted to sit on the patio but they were full so we sat inside. The sausages were flavourful and getting the pork and chilli sausage added that extra kick to it. I can't wait to come back for some mash the next time I'm in London.	this is my favourite place for mash  we ordered the cheesy mustard mash with pork and chilli sausage and onion gravy   9 25   it was drowned in gravy which i loved and finished all of  it was fun to be able to choose the type of mash  sausage and gravy  build your own mash kind of thing   this was the same for the pies as well  they were really busy on a sunday evening  but there was a table available so we were seated immediately  we wanted to sit on the patio but they were full so we sat inside  the sausages were flavourful and getting the pork and chilli sausage added that extra kick to it  i can t wait to come back for some mash the next time i m in london 
1427	5.0	Man, this place is SO good! Back in April, I landed in London during their first snow storm in years and my boyfriend and I were craving something comforting and similar to Soul Food in the US. Bangers and mash it was! Honestly, we wanted to go to Dishoom down the street, but I am so happy we ended up here!The staff here are extremely efficient and friendly! I believe I saw one guy taking orders and seating people all with a smile. I ordered the champ mash with London smokeys and my boyfriend ordered the cheesy mash with the traditional minced beef pie. Both were so flavorful and seasoned just right. I wish I had gotten a beer or something because this is the perfect food for that! The portions were also perfect for sharing. After, we decided to get the sticky pudding and it did not disappoint! I wasn't expecting too much, but left extremely satisfied and craving more!	man  this place is so good  back in april  i landed in london during their first snow storm in years and my boyfriend and i were craving something comforting and similar to soul food in the us  bangers and mash it was  honestly  we wanted to go to dishoom down the street  but i am so happy we ended up here the staff here are extremely efficient and friendly  i believe i saw one guy taking orders and seating people all with a smile  i ordered the champ mash with london smokeys and my boyfriend ordered the cheesy mash with the traditional minced beef pie  both were so flavorful and seasoned just right  i wish i had gotten a beer or something because this is the perfect food for that  the portions were also perfect for sharing  after  we decided to get the sticky pudding and it did not disappoint  i wasn t expecting too much  but left extremely satisfied and craving more 
1428	4.0	First time to London and we wanted to try some bangers and mash! We called prior to coming and were told to come in 45 minutes for a table, so I would recommend calling to make a reservation versus just walking in.I ordered the sweet potato mash with farmer's gravy and lamb & mint bangers. My boyfriend ordered the horseradish mash with onion gravy and pork chili bangers. I also got the red berries cider.If you like very sweet drinks, the cider would be your thing. It was basically juice. The mash portion was huge and each dish came with two sausages.The bangers and mash did not disappoint, although we didn't have any expectations. The cost came out to £14.20 per order (main dish + beer) which seems fair. I can't speak to its authenticity but I would recommend this place! Decent food, drink and price and great location next to Carnaby Street, Regent Street and Oxford street, good for walking off all the food.	first time to london and we wanted to try some bangers and mash  we called prior to coming and were told to come in 45 minutes for a table  so i would recommend calling to make a reservation versus just walking in i ordered the sweet potato mash with farmer s gravy and lamb   mint bangers  my boyfriend ordered the horseradish mash with onion gravy and pork chili bangers  i also got the red berries cider if you like very sweet drinks  the cider would be your thing  it was basically juice  the mash portion was huge and each dish came with two sausages the bangers and mash did not disappoint  although we didn t have any expectations  the cost came out to  14 20 per order  main dish   beer  which seems fair  i can t speak to its authenticity but i would recommend this place  decent food  drink and price and great location next to carnaby street  regent street and oxford street  good for walking off all the food

1430	4.0	Came here for dinner recently, and had a very filling and satisfying meal. This location is definitely more touristy, attracting those who want to get traditional English pies. The mix & match menu makes it fun and easy for people to try all sorts of combinations. I got a Bubbles & Squeak with Aberdeen Angus Steak & Farmers gravy on top, while my dining partner got a Warm Sausage salad. Both were big portions, and overall pretty good. I was definitely surprised by the generous portion of the salad - to the point that we were unable to finish the sausage. The greens were a welcome lightness to go with the heavier mash meal. Service was friendly and attentive. My big complaint with the restaurant was that in the back area the tables and chairs had to be the most uncomfortable set up I have ever encountered in my life - They were just high enough to leave everybody's feet dangling, ramrod straight back wooden bench booths, and the two-top tables were crazy crammed to the point that while sitting there, you would have the table practically jammed into your chest and abdomen. I seriously considered taking another star off for this horrible set up.	came here for dinner recently  and had a very filling and satisfying meal  this location is definitely more touristy  attracting those who want to get traditional english pies  the mix   match menu makes it fun and easy for people to try all sorts of combinations  i got a bubbles   squeak with aberdeen angus steak   farmers gravy on top  while my dining partner got a warm sausage salad  both were big portions  and overall pretty good  i was definitely surprised by the generous portion of the salad   to the point that we were unable to finish the sausage  the greens were a welcome lightness to go with the heavier mash meal  service was friendly and attentive  my big complaint with the restaurant was that in the back area the tables and chairs had to be the most uncomfortable set up i have ever encountered in my life   they were just high enough to leave everybody s feet dangling  ramrod straight back wooden bench booths  and the two top tables were crazy crammed to the point that while sitting there  you would have the table practically jammed into your chest and abdomen  i seriously considered taking another star off for this horrible set up

1434	3.0	Not a bad spot, not a fantastic spot. I only went here bc a friend was visiting me & seemed to hear that meat pies were all the rage. We are both from California so very interested in English culture. 3 of us went for an early dinner. Cute place, especially in the back. Not the most comfortable seats, however. We all got different pies. They got something with beef & I got chicken. I think the gravy is what makes the dish though. The Farmer's gravy I think is super tasty. Better than the traditional one, which is what I got. The mash I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. Like I said, it's all in the gravy.	not a bad spot  not a fantastic spot  i only went here bc a friend was visiting me   seemed to hear that meat pies were all the rage  we are both from california so very interested in english culture  3 of us went for an early dinner  cute place  especially in the back  not the most comfortable seats  however  we all got different pies  they got something with beef   i got chicken  i think the gravy is what makes the dish though  the farmer s gravy i think is super tasty  better than the traditional one  which is what i got  the mash i don t think you can go wrong with any of them  like i said  it s all in the gravy

I had the Aberdeen steak pie and it was just tender and meaty.  Usually pies are leaves you empty when you open the pie up, but this one was bursting with meat.All in all, comforting for being our last night in good o' Blighty. Will be back soon for more mash!Service was good and waitress was attentive.   My son dropped his lamb and mint sausage under the table and she replaced it for him.  He was happy he got to eat because he wasn't having any of MINE!Centrally located in Soho (to be precise, within Carnaby Street)	most people say english food tastes like cardboard   bland and boring are a few words to describe   but i say rubbish    i am quite an expert when it comes to comfort food and dishes that have flavours that surprises you  so when i say this place not only satisfied the belly but warmed the soul   especially on this cold january evening we ordered a combination of meat pies and sausages and both didn t disappoint    we ordered london smoke sausage and horseradish mash with onion gravy  aberdeen steak pie with regular mash and farmer s gravy  lamb hot pot pie with colcannon mash with liquor gravy  and cumberland with cheesy mash and farmer s gravy   everyone was happy with their choices and left the place full with indulgence  i had the aberdeen steak pie and it was just tender and meaty   usually pies are leaves you empty when you open the pie up  but this one was bursting with meat all in all  comforting for being our last night in good o  blighty  will be back soon for more mash service was good and waitress was attentive    my son dropped his lamb and mint sausage under the table and she replaced it for him   he was happy he got to eat because he wasn t having any of mine centrally located in soho  to be precise  within carnaby street

We originally walked here on our first full day in London, only to find out that they had maintenance issues and were closed. Thus, we walked back on our last night in London and had an early dinner. I wanted the bubble and squeak, but they were actually out. Our server recommended the colcannon as a respectable substitute. So I ordered the colcannon with the premium pork and onion gravy. My goodness was it good. Mash is perfect for a cold winter's day. It's flavorful, hearty, and chock full of all the right ingredients that is a dieter's nightmare.

MmmhmmmIt's pretty clean, standard UK service (aka not as attentive as your US counter part, but standard in the UK).Will come back if I'm back in the London.	i had a long day of sightseeing and yelp pointed me here for dinner  did not disappoint  it s tucked between a lot of busy bars and drunk people  it s a small place  but it got good food absolutely delicious banger and mash  reasonable price too  the menu is really straight forward  pick one from each column  and done  we had a pie and sausages  the mushroom sauce  farmer s  was divine  it was comforting after walking around all day  the mash was very flavorful  and i like the cheese in the mash  mmmhmmmit s pretty clean  standard uk service  aka not as attentive as your us counter part  but standard in the uk  will come back if i m back in the london

A good experience to have in London but would not say that I would ever crave this dish. I think there are a lot of different dishes out there but if you enjoy sausage, mashed potatoes, steak and gravy, this is the place for you! The location is beautiful though and I loved the interior of the store as well :-) High stars for location and outside aesthetics!	came from new york city and was good  the meat was salty and a bit spicy  the mashed potatoes went well with the dish  this is a dish i ve never had before  a good experience to have in london but would not say that i would ever crave this dish  i think there are a lot of different dishes out there but if you enjoy sausage  mashed potatoes  steak and gravy  this is the place for you  the location is beautiful though and i loved the interior of the store as well     high stars for location and outside aesthetics

They confused the plates of food. My colleague received my mash & pie which had meat in it. He's recently gone vegan so, that was definitely a problem after he took a few bites to realize there's meat in there. The food was OKAY. It was a little on the bland side TBH. The gravy was definitely necessary for me to feel like there was flavor.I just can't fully recommend this for a meal when there's so many amazing places to eat in London. Sorry team.	i heavily considered why i am giving this two stars  they were out of all their desserts except for the toffee  which the way  was more like a chocolate cake  they confused the plates of food  my colleague received my mash   pie which had meat in it  he s recently gone vegan so  that was definitely a problem after he took a few bites to realize there s meat in there  the food was okay  it was a little on the bland side tbh  the gravy was definitely necessary for me to feel like there was flavor i just can t fully recommend this for a meal when there s so many amazing places to eat in london  sorry team 
1445	2.0	Seriously worst pies we've had for our week in London. We showed up at opening at 11:30am on Saturday. They actually weren't open until closer to 11:45am. Not too bad. There were 2 other people already waiting to place their orders in. We said cool! It has to be good! But nope. We were seated by indifferent manager who later asked if we minded that their staff had a meeting as they rolled in. We didn't, but when we ordered, she didn't even know my pie was unavailable until they were about to serve us. Someone else came to tell me something was not available, so I went for the Mediterranean vegetable pie. 5 mins later my husband got his steak and ale pie plus mash, and I got my pie with mash. Food was tasteless and bland except for the gravy. Pies were obviously leftovers and reheated. Aaaaaand my husband saw one of the waitresses wrapping silverware drop a fork in the floor- and wrap it back into a napkin for service!!I've gone to hole in the wall joints with better food. Avoid this place - there are sooooo many better options in the area.	seriously worst pies we ve had for our week in london  we showed up at opening at 11 30am on saturday  they actually weren t open until closer to 11 45am  not too bad  there were 2 other people already waiting to place their orders in  we said cool  it has to be good  but nope  we were seated by indifferent manager who later asked if we minded that their staff had a meeting as they rolled in  we didn t  but when we ordered  she didn t even know my pie was unavailable until they were about to serve us  someone else came to tell me something was not available  so i went for the mediterranean vegetable pie  5 mins later my husband got his steak and ale pie plus mash  and i got my pie with mash  food was tasteless and bland except for the gravy  pies were obviously leftovers and reheated  aaaaaand my husband saw one of the waitresses wrapping silverware drop a fork in the floor  and wrap it back into a napkin for service  i ve gone to hole in the wall joints with better food  avoid this place   there are sooooo many better options in the area 
1446	5.0	Awesome British fare.  Ordered bangers and mash potatoes which were well seasoned and silky smooth.  Bangers had nice crisp to the casing when bitten into and moist on the inside. Gravy was rich and a perfect complement.  Meat pies were phenomenal as well with a nice buttery crust.  Side if fresh mashed peas complemented the meal nicely.  Service was friendly and atmosphere was cozy.	awesome british fare   ordered bangers and mash potatoes which were well seasoned and silky smooth   bangers had nice crisp to the casing when bitten into and moist on the inside  gravy was rich and a perfect complement   meat pies were phenomenal as well with a nice buttery crust   side if fresh mashed peas complemented the meal nicely   service was friendly and atmosphere was cozy

1448	5.0	Came here as a tourist and ordered a meat pie with steak with onion sauce. I can say this is the best and worst meat pie I have ever had as this was the first time I ever ate one. Don't worry though, this is actually a compliment. The pie and mashed potato with The gravy were spot on and extremely flavorful. Had a bottle of London Pride to wash this down. For desert I had a chocolate pudding with custard drizzled over it. The pudding seemed fresh and none of it seemed hardened or had been left out in a while.The shop is a bit cramped but there is a lot more room in the back. Service was great.	came here as a tourist and ordered a meat pie with steak with onion sauce  i can say this is the best and worst meat pie i have ever had as this was the first time i ever ate one  don t worry though  this is actually a compliment  the pie and mashed potato with the gravy were spot on and extremely flavorful  had a bottle of london pride to wash this down  for desert i had a chocolate pudding with custard drizzled over it  the pudding seemed fresh and none of it seemed hardened or had been left out in a while the shop is a bit cramped but there is a lot more room in the back  service was great

1450	4.0	Mother Mash! Mother of all mash in the UK. If you like mash (mashed potatoes), this place will not disappoint! Their menu is easy to follow, pick a mash, pie or sausages, and gravy. They had a variety of each. We got the following:-horseradish mash/steak pie/traditional gravy -cheesy mustard seed mash/smokey sausages(you get 2)/veggie gravy -sticky toffee puddingOur meal combinations were very delicious! We tried a similar cheese and mustard seed mash at a different pub, but it definitely didn't have a mustard taste like Mother Mash! You have quite a few choice combinations for whatever you fancy! The seating inside is pretty tight, but it just means you get a cozy meal with your significant other or a small, very small party! The service was friendly and they definitely didn't rush us. Plenty of time to dine. We also appreciated that they had free wifi.	mother mash  mother of all mash in the uk  if you like mash  mashed potatoes   this place will not disappoint  their menu is easy to follow  pick a mash  pie or sausages  and gravy  they had a variety of each  we got the following  horseradish mash steak pie traditional gravy  cheesy mustard seed mash smokey sausages you get 2  veggie gravy  sticky toffee puddingour meal combinations were very delicious  we tried a similar cheese and mustard seed mash at a different pub  but it definitely didn t have a mustard taste like mother mash  you have quite a few choice combinations for whatever you fancy  the seating inside is pretty tight  but it just means you get a cozy meal with your significant other or a small  very small party  the service was friendly and they definitely didn t rush us  plenty of time to dine  we also appreciated that they had free wifi 
1451	3.0	I like the idea of a cozy, English restaurant dedicated solely to bangers & mash and pie & mash. At Mother Mash, you choose a mashed potato, a main of either pie or sausage, & a gravy. I ordered Classic mash (made with milk & butter), Mediterranean Roast Veg pie as my main, with a healthy dose of Farmer's gravy poured on (made with red wine, onion, mushroom, & smoked bacon.) In theory, could be a hearty, comforting meal. In reality, I found fault with all three components, unfortunately. I didn't like the flavor of the gravy I chose and the mash didn't have the buttery flavor & creamy texture I was anticipating. The pie was the best part with the pastry being very tasty, but the veggies inside had no substance; there were no whole chunks of veg (you might be able to see how runny the filling is in my picture.) Around £10 for the meal; a good option if you've spent way too many quid shopping in SOHO. Perhaps the veggie sausage is better than the veggie pie...	i like the idea of a cozy  english restaurant dedicated solely to bangers   mash and pie   mash  at mother mash  you choose a mashed potato  a main of either pie or sausage    a gravy  i ordered classic mash  made with milk   butter   mediterranean roast veg pie as my main  with a healthy dose of farmer s gravy poured on  made with red wine  onion  mushroom    smoked bacon   in theory  could be a hearty  comforting meal  in reality  i found fault with all three components  unfortunately  i didn t like the flavor of the gravy i chose and the mash didn t have the buttery flavor   creamy texture i was anticipating  the pie was the best part with the pastry being very tasty  but the veggies inside had no substance  there were no whole chunks of veg  you might be able to see how runny the filling is in my picture   around  10 for the meal  a good option if you ve spent way too many quid shopping in soho  perhaps the veggie sausage is better than the veggie pie   
1452	3.0	This was good-- typical bangers and mash but that's literally all that's offered here. You choose your mash, your main (pie or meat) and then your gravy. All is good-- they didn't mess up the order and washing it down with a beer was fantastic but at the end of the day all on the menu is just bangers and mash and that can only go so far. Outside of the restaurant is beautiful with many well lit lights outside! Inside is very cozy with many small booths both inside and out.	this was good   typical bangers and mash but that s literally all that s offered here  you choose your mash  your main  pie or meat  and then your gravy  all is good   they didn t mess up the order and washing it down with a beer was fantastic but at the end of the day all on the menu is just bangers and mash and that can only go so far  outside of the restaurant is beautiful with many well lit lights outside  inside is very cozy with many small booths both inside and out

1457	5.0	Really good and affordable pies with mash (aka mashed potatoes). They've got a good selection of fillings (chicken and leek, steak and kidney, lamb - a daily special so not always available, etc) as well as different mashes. I noticed some reviewers complaining about there being too much gravy and since I'm usually not a huge gravy fan, I asked for it on the side which they kindly obliged. However, I really didn't need to have the gravy on the side because I basically used it all up because it was amazing! I mean the whole meal was great (took just a little bit to go because I was stuffed) and definitely a good place to check out if you want some good ole British pies and mash while staying in central London.Also of note, I made a reservation via OpenTable for 5 PM on a Friday night and there wasn't any line but I've heard there can be a queue so to be on the safe side, make a reservation.	really good and affordable pies with mash  aka mashed potatoes   they ve got a good selection of fillings  chicken and leek  steak and kidney  lamb   a daily special so not always available  etc  as well as different mashes  i noticed some reviewers complaining about there being too much gravy and since i m usually not a huge gravy fan  i asked for it on the side which they kindly obliged  however  i really didn t need to have the gravy on the side because i basically used it all up because it was amazing  i mean the whole meal was great  took just a little bit to go because i was stuffed  and definitely a good place to check out if you want some good ole british pies and mash while staying in central london also of note  i made a reservation via opentable for 5 pm on a friday night and there wasn t any line but i ve heard there can be a queue so to be on the safe side  make a reservation

The place was pretty tiny but the crowd moved pretty quickly. I had a plate of the Colcannon mash with a Cumberland sausage with the traditional gravy. The BF had the cheesy mash with the angus steak pie with traditional gravy. We both really enjoyed our meals and felt that the price was worth the portion of food. We had an outside table and had a great time people watching while eating our dinner.

I could eat the potatoes all day for sure.Looks like it gets fairly busy in the evening so there might be a bit of a wait for a table, but the staff were friendly and attentive.

So my friends and I decided to make our way over one night after a tourist-filled day of sightseeing.We were able to make a reservation through Open Table for a Thursday night at 9. When we arrived, it was still a packed house. Luckily, we didn't have to wait, which was good. On the negative side, our waitress really looked like she would rather be doing anything else in the world than serving us peasants. Despite this, our food and drinks still came out in a timely manner. I ordered the Cheesy Mash with Cumberland sausage. I really couldn't tell if these were good or not due to the gravy it was smothered in. Each of my three friends ordered a different mash/pie, which all came smothered in the same gravy. Maybe this is a British thing, but it made the dish super heavy. Plus, they all ended up tasting the same.Not sure where all of these great reviews are coming from...	i really wanted to try some good bangers and mash while i was in london  a yelp search showed me mother mash  so my friends and i decided to make our way over one night after a tourist filled day of sightseeing we were able to make a reservation through open table for a thursday night at 9  when we arrived  it was still a packed house  luckily  we didn t have to wait  which was good  on the negative side  our waitress really looked like she would rather be doing anything else in the world than serving us peasants  despite this  our food and drinks still came out in a timely manner  i ordered the cheesy mash with cumberland sausage  i really couldn t tell if these were good or not due to the gravy it was smothered in  each of my three friends ordered a different mash pie  which all came smothered in the same gravy  maybe this is a british thing  but it made the dish super heavy  plus  they all ended up tasting the same not sure where all of these great reviews are coming from

1477	4.0	"While in London, of course you have to try bangers and mash!I loved this little spot tucked away on this small street alongside many other cute restaurants. This restaurant, as the name suggests, specializes in the amazing comfort food of bangers and mash. I could see why the brits love this meal on a cold and wet day.To best explain the menu, its a very ""build your own"" bangers and mash experience. You choose the type of mashed potatoes, your preference of sausage, and from a selection of gravies. This part was really fun because you could customize it exactly as you would like! We were able to all order something a little different and try from each other's plates.The mashed potatoes were thick and creamy and the sausages were really great as well. I particularly liked the apple sausage. We enjoyed how homemade it felt and how the dish warmed you up from being out in the cold.On my way to the bathroom, I peeked into the kitchen where you could see the chefs working away at mixing up the small batches of mashed potatoes, clearly the size of a single order. That impressed me to realize that they were mixing up your mashed potatoes as the orders were being placed. How fabulous!Would definitely come here again and would recommend this location for a traditional bangers and mash experience. Also, to add in, the cost is really worth the value. I believe the entrees were about 10-12 pounds per entree and we left with our bellies full.P.S. It is a bit of a small restaurant so I would not suggest group sizes larger than 2-4 people."	while in london  of course you have to try bangers and mash i loved this little spot tucked away on this small street alongside many other cute restaurants  this restaurant  as the name suggests  specializes in the amazing comfort food of bangers and mash  i could see why the brits love this meal on a cold and wet day to best explain the menu  its a very  build your own  bangers and mash experience  you choose the type of mashed potatoes  your preference of sausage  and from a selection of gravies  this part was really fun because you could customize it exactly as you would like  we were able to all order something a little different and try from each other s plates the mashed potatoes were thick and creamy and the sausages were really great as well  i particularly liked the apple sausage  we enjoyed how homemade it felt and how the dish warmed you up from being out in the cold on my way to the bathroom  i peeked into the kitchen where you could see the chefs working away at mixing up the small batches of mashed potatoes  clearly the size of a single order  that impressed me to realize that they were mixing up your mashed potatoes as the orders were being placed  how fabulous would definitely come here again and would recommend this location for a traditional bangers and mash experience  also  to add in  the cost is really worth the value  i believe the entrees were about 10 12 pounds per entree and we left with our bellies full p s  it is a bit of a small restaurant so i would not suggest group sizes larger than 2 4 people

The location is in soho which is also quite lively and fun for those that are visiting from the states like myself.  The prices are very fair and the owner was very friendly. You order your mash, your main, and gravy type, We got the cheesy mash, with the angus + traditions gravy and horseradish mash, smoky sausage/ lamb mint + traditional gravy - ordered a side of peas   it was dark outside so my pictures do not do justice for the tastiness of this meal. Love it! So full and happy.	i really enjoyed my food  the location is in soho which is also quite lively and fun for those that are visiting from the states like myself   the prices are very fair and the owner was very friendly  you order your mash  your main  and gravy type  we got the cheesy mash  with the angus   traditions gravy and horseradish mash  smoky sausage  lamb mint   traditional gravy   ordered a side of peas   it was dark outside so my pictures do not do justice for the tastiness of this meal  love it  so full and happy

1482	4.0	Normally when you think of traditional British food, you think of bland potatoes and shepherd's pie (sorry Londoners, no offense - I think you have some of the best food in the world), and unhealthy food. This place definitely does not win any awards for healthy food - in fact, it's mostly carbs and meat. But it's pretty tasty if you want to indulge in some hearty food, want a quick meal, and don't want to have to hours for a table, this is a good bet. I was lucky and came in late around 9 pm on a weeknight and didn't have to wait for a table at all. Once I placed an order for my food 5-10 min later, my food came out in minutes which was great. I was done with the whole experience in 30 min. They also have free WiFi, which is nice if you're dining solo, or a tourist.The menu is pretty standard: you pick mash (basically mashed potatoes with additions inside like horseradish, cheddar, cheddar + mustard, and other options). Then you pick the sausage flavor, or a savory pie, and a gravy flavor. You either get the mash + 2 sausages, or mash + pie. You can also get the mash + pie option and add one sausage (the extra sausage being an incremental £1.50). I was indecisive, and couldn't decide between the sausage or the pie, so I got all 3 which was good since I got to try everything.If you can't decide what to order, ask the servers for recommendations - they are pretty good at giving you suggestions if you tell them what kind of mash or meat you want, and telling you what gravy and other flavors combine well. I was happy with my server's recommendations and she was very patient with my indecisiveness and was very helpful!The mash was delicious with cheddar and mustard - it was flavorful but not overpowering to the other things on my plate. I got it with the Farmer's Gravy which was red wine, onion, smoked bacon, and mushrooms. It was delicious - I thought it was going to be way too much sauce to the rest of the food when it came out but it was perfect and I ate all of it.The London Smokey sausage was also great - a bit on the smaller side but it was fine since I had the Chicken, Bacon, and Leek pie which was delicious. The size wasn't huge but it was fine with all the rest of the heavy meal. I'd say it was the size of smoke alarm detector (or Nest Thermostat if you've seen it). I loved everything about the meal - it was comforting, indulgent, and delicious and had a nice variety of things I could try without it being really expensive. The only downside is that it's not a healthy meal at all, but if you want to splurge or try British food without it being gross, this is a good place to come. They do serve 2 salads, but really, if you want salad- just go to a salad place instead. I'd come back here again!	normally when you think of traditional british food  you think of bland potatoes and shepherd s pie  sorry londoners  no offense   i think you have some of the best food in the world   and unhealthy food  this place definitely does not win any awards for healthy food   in fact  it s mostly carbs and meat  but it s pretty tasty if you want to indulge in some hearty food  want a quick meal  and don t want to have to hours for a table  this is a good bet  i was lucky and came in late around 9 pm on a weeknight and didn t have to wait for a table at all  once i placed an order for my food 5 10 min later  my food came out in minutes which was great  i was done with the whole experience in 30 min  they also have free wifi  which is nice if you re dining solo  or a tourist the menu is pretty standard  you pick mash  basically mashed potatoes with additions inside like horseradish  cheddar  cheddar   mustard  and other options   then you pick the sausage flavor  or a savory pie  and a gravy flavor  you either get the mash   2 sausages  or mash   pie  you can also get the mash   pie option and add one sausage  the extra sausage being an incremental  1 50   i was indecisive  and couldn t decide between the sausage or the pie  so i got all 3 which was good since i got to try everything if you can t decide what to order  ask the servers for recommendations   they are pretty good at giving you suggestions if you tell them what kind of mash or meat you want  and telling you what gravy and other flavors combine well  i was happy with my server s recommendations and she was very patient with my indecisiveness and was very helpful the mash was delicious with cheddar and mustard   it was flavorful but not overpowering to the other things on my plate  i got it with the farmer s gravy which was red wine  onion  smoked bacon  and mushrooms  it was delicious   i thought it was going to be way too much sauce to the rest of the food when it came out but it was perfect and i ate all of it the london smokey sausage was also great   a bit on the smaller side but it was fine since i had the chicken  bacon  and leek pie which was delicious  the size wasn t huge but it was fine with all the rest of the heavy meal  i d say it was the size of smoke alarm detector  or nest thermostat if you ve seen it   i loved everything about the meal   it was comforting  indulgent  and delicious and had a nice variety of things i could try without it being really expensive  the only downside is that it s not a healthy meal at all  but if you want to splurge or try british food without it being gross  this is a good place to come  they do serve 2 salads  but really  if you want salad  just go to a salad place instead  i d come back here again 
1483	3.0	I really wanted to enjoy this place but instead found it rather disapointing. As far as the food goes, it was good with the exception of one hard (almost burnt) sausage. I have to point out the service. Although I want to be fair - this place did seem understaffed. It was nearly impossible to grab the servers attention. When we finally did, she threw the menu and bill tray on our table. Throughout our stay, the servers didnt check up on us at all. With the gravy being on the salty side, I was dying for a drop of water and of course, I never got a refill. But I gotta say, their sticky toffee pudding was delicious!! Definitely the highlight for us.	i really wanted to enjoy this place but instead found it rather disapointing  as far as the food goes  it was good with the exception of one hard  almost burnt  sausage  i have to point out the service  although i want to be fair   this place did seem understaffed  it was nearly impossible to grab the servers attention  when we finally did  she threw the menu and bill tray on our table  throughout our stay  the servers didnt check up on us at all  with the gravy being on the salty side  i was dying for a drop of water and of course  i never got a refill  but i gotta say  their sticky toffee pudding was delicious   definitely the highlight for us

We made eye contact but she continued eating then finished a glass of water before finally coming over.Food was what I expected. It's mash and pie - good comfort food and filling but nothing super special. Location is great, especially if you sit outside to watch people walking by.	pretty bad service  i wanted to order and couldn t find the waitress  finally spotted her eating behind the counter  we made eye contact but she continued eating then finished a glass of water before finally coming over food was what i expected  it s mash and pie   good comfort food and filling but nothing super special  location is great  especially if you sit outside to watch people walking by 
1489	4.0	So this place looked oddly familiar to me, probably because I've been by a number of times, but never gone in.  Of course, that has changed because we sometimes take our students here for a meal.  I don't know how many of them try pies, sausages, or other British delicacies during their semester here, so we try to have a few meals showcasing British food.  And we try to pick places that we know will do the food justice, but is also good value for money... and Mother Mash does that.  Be warned that your choices are Pie and Mash or Sausages and Mash... I think they have two salads, but Pie/Sausage and mash is their specialty so if that's not what you are looking for, you should go somewhere else.  They do their best to cater to those with dietary restrictions, although our vegan was quite limited to the dairy free mash, veg and herb sausages, and onion gravy... and none of the desserts were vegan.  I have now been twice and I think I prefer their sausages and mash to the pie and mash.  I had the Wild Boar and Apple sausages and they are delicious... they were a special, but I think they should add them as a permanent option on the menu.  More recently I had the steak pie...  it was good, but the pie crust was a bit chewy rather than flaky and buttery.  I wonder if it just needed a longer bake.  I am partial to the Colcannon Mash (even as a lactard), but you'll probably need a mint afterward!Another reason to go with the sausages is that they offer a number of fruit pies for dessert... double pie sounds like a recipe for disaster.  I haven't had the pie, but the students seem to enjoy it.  I had their sticky toffee pudding and it is delicious and for those worried about the coffee in it (mentioned on the menu), you can't taste it.  It is simply there to enhance the flavour (I use a bit of coffee when baking chocolate cake because it seems to make it taste more chocolate-y).  I will say that the Ginger Pudding is almost always out... it is quite popular, so you may want to have a back up option just in case.The staff are always happy to accommodate us, but I will say that if you have a really large group:  1) you need to book ahead and 2) you won't all be able to sit at the same table as most of the tables seat between 2 and 4, with one table for 6 (or 8 really small people).  We did have an issue with a larger student having trouble sitting in one of the booths... so do be warned.  There are tables with chairs that pull out at the front of the restaurant, but all the seating at the back is booth style.  Definitely good value for money.	so this place looked oddly familiar to me  probably because i ve been by a number of times  but never gone in   of course  that has changed because we sometimes take our students here for a meal   i don t know how many of them try pies  sausages  or other british delicacies during their semester here  so we try to have a few meals showcasing british food   and we try to pick places that we know will do the food justice  but is also good value for money    and mother mash does that   be warned that your choices are pie and mash or sausages and mash    i think they have two salads  but pie sausage and mash is their specialty so if that s not what you are looking for  you should go somewhere else   they do their best to cater to those with dietary restrictions  although our vegan was quite limited to the dairy free mash  veg and herb sausages  and onion gravy    and none of the desserts were vegan   i have now been twice and i think i prefer their sausages and mash to the pie and mash   i had the wild boar and apple sausages and they are delicious    they were a special  but i think they should add them as a permanent option on the menu   more recently i had the steak pie     it was good  but the pie crust was a bit chewy rather than flaky and buttery   i wonder if it just needed a longer bake   i am partial to the colcannon mash  even as a lactard   but you ll probably need a mint afterward another reason to go with the sausages is that they offer a number of fruit pies for dessert    double pie sounds like a recipe for disaster   i haven t had the pie  but the students seem to enjoy it   i had their sticky toffee pudding and it is delicious and for those worried about the coffee in it  mentioned on the menu   you can t taste it   it is simply there to enhance the flavour  i use a bit of coffee when baking chocolate cake because it seems to make it taste more chocolate y    i will say that the ginger pudding is almost always out    it is quite popular  so you may want to have a back up option just in case the staff are always happy to accommodate us  but i will say that if you have a really large group   1  you need to book ahead and 2  you won t all be able to sit at the same table as most of the tables seat between 2 and 4  with one table for 6  or 8 really small people    we did have an issue with a larger student having trouble sitting in one of the booths    so do be warned   there are tables with chairs that pull out at the front of the restaurant  but all the seating at the back is booth style   definitely good value for money 
1490	5.0	After visiting the British Museum, we walked down to Mother Mash to try some English pies and sausages. Once arriving we could see the restaurant was small, but luckily we didn't have to wait for an available table. We ordered the chicken pie with leeks and bacon paired with cheesy mash and farmers gravy. Our other main dish was the premium pork and London smokey sausages with classic mash and traditional gravy. It was really cold and snowing that night so eating the dishes felt so comforting. Both dishes were great but I think my favorite was probably the chicken pie. The sausages were great but the pie was slightly better tasting and paired so well with the mash and gravy we chose. Service was average, but that seemed as a result of one person was doing it all so she was really busy.	after visiting the british museum  we walked down to mother mash to try some english pies and sausages  once arriving we could see the restaurant was small  but luckily we didn t have to wait for an available table  we ordered the chicken pie with leeks and bacon paired with cheesy mash and farmers gravy  our other main dish was the premium pork and london smokey sausages with classic mash and traditional gravy  it was really cold and snowing that night so eating the dishes felt so comforting  both dishes were great but i think my favorite was probably the chicken pie  the sausages were great but the pie was slightly better tasting and paired so well with the mash and gravy we chose  service was average  but that seemed as a result of one person was doing it all so she was really busy 
1491	4.0	Food was five stars, service was three, so we meet in the middle.We were looking for a spot with yummy bangers and mash in London, and for that I highly recommend Mother Mash. It's a small storefront, but grab a seat outside to people-watch and enjoy the location. The menu is a three-step, allowing you to choose your mash, main and gravy.I ordered the champ mashed potatoes, Cumberland links and traditional gravy. I also got a side of buttered savoy cabbage because I couldn't decide between champ mash or Colcannon. It was incredibly difficult to decide as everything sounded delicious. I do wish they put a description on their sausages, because I personally don't know the difference between Cumberland, Oxford, Smithfield, etc. until I asked our server. The mash was buttery, smooth and perfect with the crunch of spring onions. The Cumberland links were snappy with a hint of garlic, and paired excellent with the traditional gravy. I even mixed in some of my cabbage with my dish. Yum!My partner ordered the horseradish mash, Aberdeen steak pie (they do have vegetarian options), and Farmer's gravy. There was only a slight hint of horseradish (as big fans, we do wish it was a bit stronger), the pie flaky with tender, but slightly overcooked steak. The gravy though was to die for, with tangy red wine and smoky bacon flavors. Obviously do not come here if you aren't in the mood for something heavy, filling and comforting! I truly don't think you can go wrong with any combination.As far as service, we were sat then checked up upon, but when we weren't yet ready to order, it was about another 15 minutes until we were checked on again. The food came out quickly once we ordered, but the server forgot the side of cabbage I ordered, and didn't come back until we were almost done with our meal, when we had to ask for the side again.All in all, if you're looking for a flavorful and tasty bangers and mash, I do recommend! The ingredients taste high quality and full of flavor versus more traditional bangers and mash. Just know what to expect when it comes to service (as it seems a lot of other reviews comment on this as well). Can't complain about the price either!	food was five stars  service was three  so we meet in the middle we were looking for a spot with yummy bangers and mash in london  and for that i highly recommend mother mash  it s a small storefront  but grab a seat outside to people watch and enjoy the location  the menu is a three step  allowing you to choose your mash  main and gravy i ordered the champ mashed potatoes  cumberland links and traditional gravy  i also got a side of buttered savoy cabbage because i couldn t decide between champ mash or colcannon  it was incredibly difficult to decide as everything sounded delicious  i do wish they put a description on their sausages  because i personally don t know the difference between cumberland  oxford  smithfield  etc  until i asked our server  the mash was buttery  smooth and perfect with the crunch of spring onions  the cumberland links were snappy with a hint of garlic  and paired excellent with the traditional gravy  i even mixed in some of my cabbage with my dish  yum my partner ordered the horseradish mash  aberdeen steak pie  they do have vegetarian options   and farmer s gravy  there was only a slight hint of horseradish  as big fans  we do wish it was a bit stronger   the pie flaky with tender  but slightly overcooked steak  the gravy though was to die for  with tangy red wine and smoky bacon flavors  obviously do not come here if you aren t in the mood for something heavy  filling and comforting  i truly don t think you can go wrong with any combination as far as service  we were sat then checked up upon  but when we weren t yet ready to order  it was about another 15 minutes until we were checked on again  the food came out quickly once we ordered  but the server forgot the side of cabbage i ordered  and didn t come back until we were almost done with our meal  when we had to ask for the side again all in all  if you re looking for a flavorful and tasty bangers and mash  i do recommend  the ingredients taste high quality and full of flavor versus more traditional bangers and mash  just know what to expect when it comes to service  as it seems a lot of other reviews comment on this as well   can t complain about the price either 
1492	5.0	This was the first restaurant we tried on our first day in London and I was very happy with the experience!  We wanted to try a British spot to start our week-long trip right.  Mother Mash was across my hotel so it was a quick walk over to the plaza.  There were no lines, thank goodness - though we did come in just a little before dinner.  The Food: I ordered the sweet potato mash with minced beef meat pie, topped with farmers gravy.  I was a little concerned with the outcome because I felt if things were left for me to create... I can't guarantee it'll be a good combo.  My dish turned out delicious!  My friend ordered champ mash with angus beef pie, topped with traditional gravy - it was also delicious.  I didn't know mashed potatoes and meat pies could be so beautifully plated.  The mashes were extremely tasty and flavorful.  The pies were flaky; they didn't skimp out on the meat imo.  The gravy had perfect consistency.  I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting London. The prices were in a do-able price range if you're trying to eat on a budget (hard to do in London + eating out! lol)	this was the first restaurant we tried on our first day in london and i was very happy with the experience   we wanted to try a british spot to start our week long trip right   mother mash was across my hotel so it was a quick walk over to the plaza   there were no lines  thank goodness   though we did come in just a little before dinner   the food  i ordered the sweet potato mash with minced beef meat pie  topped with farmers gravy   i was a little concerned with the outcome because i felt if things were left for me to create    i can t guarantee it ll be a good combo   my dish turned out delicious   my friend ordered champ mash with angus beef pie  topped with traditional gravy   it was also delicious   i didn t know mashed potatoes and meat pies could be so beautifully plated   the mashes were extremely tasty and flavorful   the pies were flaky  they didn t skimp out on the meat imo   the gravy had perfect consistency   i would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting london  the prices were in a do able price range if you re trying to eat on a budget  hard to do in london   eating out  lol

1494	2.0	I really, reeeally wanted to love this place but the service let me down and the food didn't make up for it. We had been doing some sightseeing and I was looking for a casual but nice spot with some good pie and sticky toffee pudding for my family to enjoy on our last day in London (it's London-I'm expecting some good stuff).The concept at Mother Mash is great- you pick your mash, pie/sausage, and gravy. The prices are reasonable and it's in a great area. While the food was pretty good, the poor service really let me down. We had arrived an hour before closing and luckily they had a table open. Our waitress promptly took our order and when I asked if we should order our dessert now or later, she quickly said to wait and order it later. We didn't see her again until we left the restaurant (like seriously didn't see her-this spot is small and you can see everyone in the dining area); someone else dropped off our food, and then someone else came by to ask if we wanted to order anymore drinks before the check. When I asked if we could order dessert, the waitress informed me they were no longer taking food orders because the kitchen had closed. As a huge dessert fan, I was irritated to say the least. Considering how small this place is, how did we not see our waitress again and why tell me not to order dessert if you're going to ignore us for the rest of the evening?! She magically appeared as we were walking out and rest assured she got some side eye from me.There were a ton of great looking restaurants in the area so I probably won't be giving Mother Mash another shot.	i really  reeeally wanted to love this place but the service let me down and the food didn t make up for it  we had been doing some sightseeing and i was looking for a casual but nice spot with some good pie and sticky toffee pudding for my family to enjoy on our last day in london  it s london i m expecting some good stuff  the concept at mother mash is great  you pick your mash  pie sausage  and gravy  the prices are reasonable and it s in a great area  while the food was pretty good  the poor service really let me down  we had arrived an hour before closing and luckily they had a table open  our waitress promptly took our order and when i asked if we should order our dessert now or later  she quickly said to wait and order it later  we didn t see her again until we left the restaurant  like seriously didn t see her this spot is small and you can see everyone in the dining area   someone else dropped off our food  and then someone else came by to ask if we wanted to order anymore drinks before the check  when i asked if we could order dessert  the waitress informed me they were no longer taking food orders because the kitchen had closed  as a huge dessert fan  i was irritated to say the least  considering how small this place is  how did we not see our waitress again and why tell me not to order dessert if you re going to ignore us for the rest of the evening   she magically appeared as we were walking out and rest assured she got some side eye from me there were a ton of great looking restaurants in the area so i probably won t be giving mother mash another shot

The staff was extremely friendly; I even noticed one man giving directions to someone outside. The food was phenomenal. We also had a blackberry and apple pie for dessert which was good. As a side note.. this is a very tiny place and if you have a group larger than 4 it might be a bit uncomfortable. But for two is was perfect!	the first place we visited on our trip  we elected to wait a bit for lunch instead of breakfast and i m so glad we did  i love the selections for building your own mash  the staff was extremely friendly  i even noticed one man giving directions to someone outside  the food was phenomenal  we also had a blackberry and apple pie for dessert which was good  as a side note   this is a very tiny place and if you have a group larger than 4 it might be a bit uncomfortable  but for two is was perfect 
1503	4.0	Thank you Yelpers for helping me find this delicious spot during a recent trip to London.  I knew I wanted some traditional meat pies on this trip, but what I got at Mother Mash was everything else instead! We had a late lunch and were seated right away at a outside small table. The menu is simple with either mash and sausages or mash with pie.  I went with the angus steak pie with the champ mash.  We also shared a side of bacon wrapped beans and butter cabbage.  The mash with cheese and spring onion was THE most delicious mash potato I never had!! It was a big serving with a ton of traditional gravy, which I'm glad so I didn't have to fight that much with my husband!  The two sides we got were also very tasty! I would have to say the meat pie was not how I would like, I think something with their crust is not as flaky.  I remember having better pies on a previous London trip.  I would have to say Mother Mash is THE mother of all mash definitely!	thank you yelpers for helping me find this delicious spot during a recent trip to london   i knew i wanted some traditional meat pies on this trip  but what i got at mother mash was everything else instead  we had a late lunch and were seated right away at a outside small table  the menu is simple with either mash and sausages or mash with pie   i went with the angus steak pie with the champ mash   we also shared a side of bacon wrapped beans and butter cabbage   the mash with cheese and spring onion was the most delicious mash potato i never had   it was a big serving with a ton of traditional gravy  which i m glad so i didn t have to fight that much with my husband   the two sides we got were also very tasty  i would have to say the meat pie was not how i would like  i think something with their crust is not as flaky   i remember having better pies on a previous london trip   i would have to say mother mash is the mother of all mash definitely 
1504	4.0	Small restaurant in Soho where tables are close and service is fast.  Stick to pie and mash + a local craft beer and skip the espresso.  Not busy early week, they do take reservations. Lots of pie and mash in town, would only return if close by.	small restaurant in soho where tables are close and service is fast   stick to pie and mash   a local craft beer and skip the espresso   not busy early week  they do take reservations  lots of pie and mash in town  would only return if close by

I ended up getting the Angus steak pie, the champ mash, with traditional gravy which was a good combination. The mash was loaded with scallions so be sure to have mints or gum available!

But traditional English food is in reality hearty, delicious, and suited to the terroir; it has no less merit than any other European cuisine, it's just that it's too often executed horribly by Greene King pubs and their ilk. So a thought a few weeks ago, why does this have to be so? Mother Mash, I'm pleased to report, does traditional English food justice. Everything is prepared with care using great ingredients. The dishes are flavorful and the surroundings hip, cozy, and convivial, not kitschy. I had the bubble and squeak, Angus beef pie, and Farmers gravy, washed down with Bulmer's. The prices are very good for what you get. The service left a bit to be desired, although this was in part due to a language barrier with some of the waitstaff. Nonetheless, I'll be visiting Mother Mash again, as I applaud both the concept and the execution thereof."	coming from north america  i d long thought of  british food  as sort of a punchline to a bad joke  something to be endured  snickered at  not savored  but traditional english food is in reality hearty  delicious  and suited to the terroir  it has no less merit than any other european cuisine  it s just that it s too often executed horribly by greene king pubs and their ilk  so a thought a few weeks ago  why does this have to be so  mother mash  i m pleased to report  does traditional english food justice  everything is prepared with care using great ingredients  the dishes are flavorful and the surroundings hip  cozy  and convivial  not kitschy  i had the bubble and squeak  angus beef pie  and farmers gravy  washed down with bulmer s  the prices are very good for what you get  the service left a bit to be desired  although this was in part due to a language barrier with some of the waitstaff  nonetheless  i ll be visiting mother mash again  as i applaud both the concept and the execution thereof

My dad is vegetarian so he was really excited to have their sweet potato mash, veggie gravy and veggie pie! He really did enjoy it! My mom and I both had the cheesy mash, traditional pork bangers and traditional gravy. It was good but nothing special in my opinion. The gravy was too thin and the mash wasn't cheesy at all. I wasn't too impressed. My dad was very happy with his meal though.	we loved the concept of the restaurant so we decided to give it a try  we enjoyed going step by step and picking out our mash  meat and gravy  my dad is vegetarian so he was really excited to have their sweet potato mash  veggie gravy and veggie pie  he really did enjoy it  my mom and i both had the cheesy mash  traditional pork bangers and traditional gravy  it was good but nothing special in my opinion  the gravy was too thin and the mash wasn t cheesy at all  i wasn t too impressed  my dad was very happy with his meal though

(Can't remember damn name of gravy) but it was delicious! And couldn't eat it all for less than 12 pounds a piece! Had great red berries cider and Hells beer. Great service and nice waitresses that didn't treat us like stupid Americans when we tried to pay with euros! Lol! Would absolutely recommend! And would love to go back for sticky toffee pudding (we were too full to even try) but another table had it and it was huge!!

1519	3.0	Stopped here because of Yelp reviews.  It was not a direct Tube route for us, so we were disappointed the first night when we were turned away because the entire restaurant was booked for a private party.  Since we really wanted to try the sausage and pie with mash, we came back the next day, but they were out of the traditional mince meat pie... another disappointment.  I had the cheesy mustard mash, chicken pie, and farmers gravy while Hubby had the cheesy mash, London smokey sausage, and farmers gravy.  Both were good.  On top of the previous disappointments, they did not take American Express.  I would not rate the food as THAT good to overcome being turned away the first night, out of mince meat pie, and no acceptance of AmEx.  Mother Mash would have earn an extra star if we just ran into it rather than trying to live up to the hype.	stopped here because of yelp reviews   it was not a direct tube route for us  so we were disappointed the first night when we were turned away because the entire restaurant was booked for a private party   since we really wanted to try the sausage and pie with mash  we came back the next day  but they were out of the traditional mince meat pie    another disappointment   i had the cheesy mustard mash  chicken pie  and farmers gravy while hubby had the cheesy mash  london smokey sausage  and farmers gravy   both were good   on top of the previous disappointments  they did not take american express   i would not rate the food as that good to overcome being turned away the first night  out of mince meat pie  and no acceptance of amex   mother mash would have earn an extra star if we just ran into it rather than trying to live up to the hype

But once we did we wanted to go right back, despite being in the middle of SoHo with countless options around. The food is deceptionaly simple, incredibly delicious British comfort food. It's not the kind of stuff that appeals to a lot of the ""clean-eating"" (bleh) modern palate. But if you like things that are actually tasty at a really affordable price then this spot is worth a trip. The steak pie was better than the mince beef.The sticky toffee pudding was a little disappointing. It just wasn't sweet enough, which may be due to our sweets-loving American palates. I've had sticky toffee pudding stateside that was one of the best things I've ever eaten so I really had my hopes up for it. The custard in particular was very thin and bland so I'd skip dessert if I went again and I'm still giving the place 5 stars because the pies are worth it."	this was one of the best places i ate while in london  it was summer  and we had to wait for the right moment to eat such a heavy meal  but once we did we wanted to go right back  despite being in the middle of soho with countless options around  the food is deceptionaly simple  incredibly delicious british comfort food  it s not the kind of stuff that appeals to a lot of the  clean eating   bleh  modern palate  but if you like things that are actually tasty at a really affordable price then this spot is worth a trip  the steak pie was better than the mince beef the sticky toffee pudding was a little disappointing  it just wasn t sweet enough  which may be due to our sweets loving american palates  i ve had sticky toffee pudding stateside that was one of the best things i ve ever eaten so i really had my hopes up for it  the custard in particular was very thin and bland so i d skip dessert if i went again and i m still giving the place 5 stars because the pies are worth it 
1521	5.0	THIS is the place I take people from out of town. The great thing about Mother Mash is it's soooooo British (isn't it? Or am I confused? To me it is anyways) because it's got all the stuff- mashed potatoes, peas, bubbles and squeak, sausage, pies, beer...etc. and it tastes WONDERFUL. There's those pubs that serve all those things but the food is only sub-par but people go there because it's British. Mother Mash serves excellent food and the menu is really cool because you can customize it the way you like. First you pick your mash- they've got a wide variety between mashed taters with horseradish, mustard, bubbles and squeak (veggies), sweet potato...etc.  And then you pick your main- a wide selection of sausages and pies (vegetarian options for both), and then your sauce. It's wonderful! The location is equally wonderful- in Carnaby Court right off Regent Street. We've been here a few times and the wait staff is always great.I go vegetarian and I think it's delicious- the bubbles and squeak and horseradish mash is my favorite, and the veggie sausage or goat cheese pie are winners.	this is the place i take people from out of town  the great thing about mother mash is it s soooooo british  isn t it  or am i confused  to me it is anyways  because it s got all the stuff  mashed potatoes  peas  bubbles and squeak  sausage  pies  beer   etc  and it tastes wonderful  there s those pubs that serve all those things but the food is only sub par but people go there because it s british  mother mash serves excellent food and the menu is really cool because you can customize it the way you like  first you pick your mash  they ve got a wide variety between mashed taters with horseradish  mustard  bubbles and squeak  veggies   sweet potato   etc   and then you pick your main  a wide selection of sausages and pies  vegetarian options for both   and then your sauce  it s wonderful  the location is equally wonderful  in carnaby court right off regent street  we ve been here a few times and the wait staff is always great i go vegetarian and i think it s delicious  the bubbles and squeak and horseradish mash is my favorite  and the veggie sausage or goat cheese pie are winners

Service is attentive and the food came out pretty fast.I had the sweet potato mash and opted for the angus steak pie with the farmer's gravy. This was my first time having this type of food. It was really filling, especially for a cold night like this. My bf had three different kinds of sausages and they were super tasty. The sweet potato went well with the farmer's gravy. It wasn't too sweet and more savory. The pie crust was crispy on top and then still held up decently as it soaked in the gravy. The steak was okay tasting, it kind of got lost in the gravy and sweet potato though.Portion sizes are decent and I felt good leaving. They do have desserts and sides you can always add as well as the usual tea, OJ and apple available.	this place is decent for bangers and mash here in london  service is attentive and the food came out pretty fast i had the sweet potato mash and opted for the angus steak pie with the farmer s gravy  this was my first time having this type of food  it was really filling  especially for a cold night like this  my bf had three different kinds of sausages and they were super tasty  the sweet potato went well with the farmer s gravy  it wasn t too sweet and more savory  the pie crust was crispy on top and then still held up decently as it soaked in the gravy  the steak was okay tasting  it kind of got lost in the gravy and sweet potato though portion sizes are decent and i felt good leaving  they do have desserts and sides you can always add as well as the usual tea  oj and apple available

1528	4.0	We stumbled upon this restaurant while wandering through Carnaby. We ordered cheddar mustard mash with Angus pie & traditional gravy and Irish mash with butternut squash pie and red wine gravy. Delicious. I liked that you could order a sausage by the link for £1.5 -- wild boar & apple was yummy. The side of grilled French beans was a nice way to lighten up the dish, but the mixed veggies were lackluster. Wish I'd thought to look to see if pints were available; that would have nicely rounded out the meal. Service was a bit inattentive, but not horrid. Would definitely make a return visit to Mother Mash.	we stumbled upon this restaurant while wandering through carnaby  we ordered cheddar mustard mash with angus pie   traditional gravy and irish mash with butternut squash pie and red wine gravy  delicious  i liked that you could order a sausage by the link for  1 5    wild boar   apple was yummy  the side of grilled french beans was a nice way to lighten up the dish  but the mixed veggies were lackluster  wish i d thought to look to see if pints were available  that would have nicely rounded out the meal  service was a bit inattentive  but not horrid  would definitely make a return visit to mother mash

The servers are very nice and the service is quick. You pick your mash, your pie, and then your gravy and you are done! We enjoyed the Angus steak pie with our champ mash along with the green beans wrapped in bacon. All the food was prepared with seasonings and flavor beyond my expectations. The server made a mistake on my type of mash potatoes and promptly fixed it with no issue. We also had their bottled cidar. The berry flavored cidar was amazing! The apple pie was so yummy with the ice cream and was large enough for us to share as it came as a small pie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. This place is not great are large groups as the space is small and seating is tight. Also, they ran out of several desserts on the menu and it was only 830PM. I loved this food at a tourist being able to have traditional food during our stay was important. The Angus was tender, and had a lot of flavor along with sauce in the pie. Be prepared to eat alot of carbs if eating here but it will be well worth the carb overload!!	we loved this spot for dinner  we took the train and found it in a district with tons of other bars  it wss near the action it is a small but quaint hole in the wall  the servers are very nice and the service is quick  you pick your mash  your pie  and then your gravy and you are done  we enjoyed the angus steak pie with our champ mash along with the green beans wrapped in bacon  all the food was prepared with seasonings and flavor beyond my expectations  the server made a mistake on my type of mash potatoes and promptly fixed it with no issue  we also had their bottled cidar  the berry flavored cidar was amazing  the apple pie was so yummy with the ice cream and was large enough for us to share as it came as a small pie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream  this place is not great are large groups as the space is small and seating is tight  also  they ran out of several desserts on the menu and it was only 830pm  i loved this food at a tourist being able to have traditional food during our stay was important  the angus was tender  and had a lot of flavor along with sauce in the pie  be prepared to eat alot of carbs if eating here but it will be well worth the carb overload

1539	5.0	Absolutely delicious. As an American who has never had meat pies with mash and gravy, I am certain it can't get better than this. The thickness of the mash, the crustiness of the mince meat pie, and the smoothness of the gravy was the perfect combination on a rainy London evening. Do yourself a favor, whether you're a tourist or a London native, and EAT HERE.	absolutely delicious  as an american who has never had meat pies with mash and gravy  i am certain it can t get better than this  the thickness of the mash  the crustiness of the mince meat pie  and the smoothness of the gravy was the perfect combination on a rainy london evening  do yourself a favor  whether you re a tourist or a london native  and eat here

We were told they were closed already, I protested and said they listed their hours until 10.  The waitress said she would check with the kitchen and then returned with menus and said we could order but only if we did it quickly! While the waitress stood at the end of the table and a man, who I assume was cook, glared at us with contempt we scanned the menu, ordered the special of the day, one cheesy mash with with sausages, one with smoked sausages and a lamb pie. We asked that the gravy be put on the side on all orders. Our orders arrived fairly quickly and we noticed right away every order was covered in gravy, when we reminded her we ordered it on the side she just said ""yeah, the cook got it wrong."" as she put the dishes on the table. We did not see her again until she brought the bill, no water refills, no offer of desert......and it was 10:10 when we paid. Oh yeah, the food, it was good, not great, but the horrible service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. My suggestion, skip this place, there are some really good spots with much better food and service in the area."	my wife and i really wanted to try this place after seeing it on yelp  we went by at 5 on a tuesday but were told they were closed due to a private party so we headed back on wednesday and arrived at 9 38 pm  we were told they were closed already  i protested and said they listed their hours until 10   the waitress said she would check with the kitchen and then returned with menus and said we could order but only if we did it quickly  while the waitress stood at the end of the table and a man  who i assume was cook  glared at us with contempt we scanned the menu  ordered the special of the day  one cheesy mash with with sausages  one with smoked sausages and a lamb pie  we asked that the gravy be put on the side on all orders  our orders arrived fairly quickly and we noticed right away every order was covered in gravy  when we reminded her we ordered it on the side she just said  yeah  the cook got it wrong   as she put the dishes on the table  we did not see her again until she brought the bill  no water refills  no offer of desert      and it was 10 10 when we paid  oh yeah  the food  it was good  not great  but the horrible service left us with a bad taste in our mouths  my suggestion  skip this place  there are some really good spots with much better food and service in the area

When the food arrived, there was silence and everyone was digging in.  The meal was a home run and was very satisfying.  My wife had a lemonade and I believe my daughter had a cider with water for the rest of us.   I would come here again to enjoy the mash.	this is a hearty meal in the soho part of town   having walked to this restaurant  my two kids where asking what was so special eating here   we ordered the mash  sausages and farmers gravy  when the food arrived  there was silence and everyone was digging in   the meal was a home run and was very satisfying   my wife had a lemonade and i believe my daughter had a cider with water for the rest of us    i would come here again to enjoy the mash

1546	4.0	Bangers and mash galore. Cheap, centrally located, fast, and tasty. You can't ask for more from this sort of place. The menu has you choose either sausages (2) or a pie, and then pair that with a mash and a gravy. We sampled a couple types of sausage, as well as the classic and sweet potato mashes. Everything was tasty. The sausages were juicy and very flavorful. The mashes were also good. The protons aren't huge, but then they don't need to be with such heavy food. A good spot for a quick lunch break while walking SoHo.	bangers and mash galore  cheap  centrally located  fast  and tasty  you can t ask for more from this sort of place  the menu has you choose either sausages  2  or a pie  and then pair that with a mash and a gravy  we sampled a couple types of sausage  as well as the classic and sweet potato mashes  everything was tasty  the sausages were juicy and very flavorful  the mashes were also good  the protons aren t huge  but then they don t need to be with such heavy food  a good spot for a quick lunch break while walking soho

London, like my native home of Los Angeles, has a wide variety of diverse food from different cultures and countries.  However for whatever reason I've been having a hard time finding modern twist on traditional British food, so I was excited to stumble upon Mother Mash. This restaurant primarily offer sausages and pies and allows their patrons to choose from a variety of different kinds. You can also pick fun and unique selections of mash potatoes and gravy to accompany your meal.With that said...this place is solid and safe but the taste of the food is missing that X factor (no BBC pun intended) .... I wouldn't go out of my way to come here and to top it off they wouldn't serve me dessert because they were closing in 15 min.  Lame...	i ve been in london for about 3 days now and have seen eaten a lot of different food  london  like my native home of los angeles  has a wide variety of diverse food from different cultures and countries   however for whatever reason i ve been having a hard time finding modern twist on traditional british food  so i was excited to stumble upon mother mash  this restaurant primarily offer sausages and pies and allows their patrons to choose from a variety of different kinds  you can also pick fun and unique selections of mash potatoes and gravy to accompany your meal with that said   this place is solid and safe but the taste of the food is missing that x factor  no bbc pun intended       i wouldn t go out of my way to come here and to top it off they wouldn t serve me dessert because they were closing in 15 min   lame

The service leaves much to be desired but I didn't mind because Mother Mash knows how to do an amazing bangers and mash. The mash was cheesy and warm while the bangers were spectacularly delicious. I couldn't finish my meal but I remember regretting not taking it home (we were on the way to the London Eye). The menu is small but that's what it needs to be especially when they make amazing food!

1552	5.0	My sister and I ate here our first night in London after some Yelp searching. We also came back a few days later for breakfast! We walked up and it was packed! Thankfully we snagged the last available table. My sister was very excited, because she's a vegetarian and they had many veggie options. The menu is is simple. You choose which mash you'd like, pie or sausage, and finally the gravy that will go with it. There are quite a few options for each category. I chose the traditional Irish mash, with a steak pie, and traditional gravy. My veggie sis got the cheese mash, butternut squash pie, and onion gravy. By the end we both wanted to lick our plates clean! The service was pretty great too, our waitress was very nice and attentive. Prices were also awesome! I had a cider and she had a juice plus our meals, and we spent less than $30 in total. Breakfast was super delicious. I had the traditional English breakfast and my sis had the veggie breakfast. Those mushrooms were the best thing ever! Thankfully my sis doesn't like mushrooms so I got eat hers too, muhaha. The little potato cake is so amazing.

I ordered the veggie pot pie with liquor gravy and cheesy mustard mash. I love that they let you customize your order but the quality isn't up to par. The pie was dry and bland. The mash was not cheesy - just a strong mustard taste. As for the gravy, it gave the pie an off taste so I mixed it with the mash.	had to get another pot pie since it was my last day in london and i was extremely excited after having my first pot pie for lunch  this was double the price and double the disappointment  i ordered the veggie pot pie with liquor gravy and cheesy mustard mash  i love that they let you customize your order but the quality isn t up to par  the pie was dry and bland  the mash was not cheesy   just a strong mustard taste  as for the gravy  it gave the pie an off taste so i mixed it with the mash

I love how the menu is set-up; (1) choose your mash, (2) chose your pie and (3) chose your gravy. There were tons of veggie options at each step which was really fantastic. The waitress was sweet and quick to guide us ""pie & mash rookies"". The food came out quickly and really was fantastic. I got the cheese & mustard mash which had an amazing kick to it! The Mediterranean vegetable pie was flavourful and perfectly cooked (I was worried the insides would be soggy or mushy but they were perfection). It was all topped off with the onion gravy which wasn't too strong and paired well with my pie and mash choices. i ended my meal with ginger bread and custard which could have been a little sweeter. I would recommend going with the ice cream rather than the custard. I was feeling adventurous with the custard but it wasn't particularly to my taste - perhaps a little too authentic for a foreigner.

1576	4.0	A very nice, cosy little place for lunch/dinner. They have a bunch of different types of mash. We tried the Champ, Colcannon and Cheesy mustard. They were all pretty good, though the cheesy mustard is probably an acquired taste. The spring onions in the Champ were a bit undercooked as well for people who dislike raw onions. Our favorite was definitely the Colcannon. For the mains, I would definitely recommend the pies over the sausages. Their pie crusts are delicious. We also tried their ginger beer, which was awesome!

Pie crust was flaky and I could taste the mustard in the mash. Farmers gravy made it a rich and delicious dish. It was finished with London Pride beer and hit the spot on a gray and cold day.

1581	5.0	Before I go to London I decided to search for some restaurants that served British food. Mother Mash showed up and the pictures looked amazing. Once I got to London I looked for this restaurant and despite it being far from my hotel, I made there an hour before they close.  I ordered the steak pie with Irish mash and farmers gravy. Oh my god!! It was sooo delicious that I couldn't help but to order again the lamb sausage with mint and the same mash and gravy. I just wish I had more time in London so I could try more items on the menu of this restaurant but everything I had were excellent with very reasonable prices.	before i go to london i decided to search for some restaurants that served british food  mother mash showed up and the pictures looked amazing  once i got to london i looked for this restaurant and despite it being far from my hotel  i made there an hour before they close   i ordered the steak pie with irish mash and farmers gravy  oh my god   it was sooo delicious that i couldn t help but to order again the lamb sausage with mint and the same mash and gravy  i just wish i had more time in london so i could try more items on the menu of this restaurant but everything i had were excellent with very reasonable prices

1583	3.0	My first meal in London! I came in after a few days in Ireland, so I really wanted a salad...which they did not have. I guess they're really called Mother Mash for a reason. I ended up getting a mushroom mash with a beef pie. Both were pretty good. and pretty solid food. The sauce thing they used for the mash was SUPER salty. I really loved the ginger beer they serve here, though I suspect ginger beer in London is just really good. The food itself was overly heavy for me. I really wanted some veggies, and I clearly shouldn't have come here. But it was pretty solid food, and if you wanted some mash, this would be good. When we walked in, there was zero space to wait. We didn't really know what to do, and my friend and I wanted to walk a little closer to their register to wait...and immediately got yelled at by their staff. WTF. There's NO SPACE FOR US TO WAIT. In order for people to exit, we (and the two people waiting after us) had to file out of the restaurant. And the waitress didn't acknowledge us when we came in. And she DARED to yell at us!? Hella wrong.	my first meal in london  i came in after a few days in ireland  so i really wanted a salad   which they did not have  i guess they re really called mother mash for a reason  i ended up getting a mushroom mash with a beef pie  both were pretty good  and pretty solid food  the sauce thing they used for the mash was super salty  i really loved the ginger beer they serve here  though i suspect ginger beer in london is just really good  the food itself was overly heavy for me  i really wanted some veggies  and i clearly shouldn t have come here  but it was pretty solid food  and if you wanted some mash  this would be good  when we walked in  there was zero space to wait  we didn t really know what to do  and my friend and i wanted to walk a little closer to their register to wait   and immediately got yelled at by their staff  wtf  there s no space for us to wait  in order for people to exit  we  and the two people waiting after us  had to file out of the restaurant  and the waitress didn t acknowledge us when we came in  and she dared to yell at us   hella wrong 
1584	5.0	"Yum!This was so delicious!  My husband and I stopped in here on our first day in London while roaming the streets and shopping.  This store is located near a ton of shopping and pubs so there are a lot of options but I wanted to go for something really traditional on my first day in the UK.  So ""bangers and mash"" it was! We arrived at around 5pm and there was one other couple eating outside - we chose to sit inside. The menu is pretty straight-forward as you choose your protein (sausage, veggie pastry), your mash (tons of options for the potatoes), and your sauce.  I chose to be as healthy as I could and got a veggie pasty with butternut squash, a veggie sauce, and chunky mashed potatoes with cheese and chives.  Our server was very friendly and the food was out quickly and tasted really delicious.  The pasty was light and fluffy and full of veggies and the mash was freakin' good. We decided to dessert and split it and had an apple mash of some kind with vanilla ice cream.  It had the consistency of oatmeal or something but was really good.  My hubs loved it.I feel like it was a good choice for our first day in London."	yum this was so delicious   my husband and i stopped in here on our first day in london while roaming the streets and shopping   this store is located near a ton of shopping and pubs so there are a lot of options but i wanted to go for something really traditional on my first day in the uk   so  bangers and mash  it was  we arrived at around 5pm and there was one other couple eating outside   we chose to sit inside  the menu is pretty straight forward as you choose your protein  sausage  veggie pastry   your mash  tons of options for the potatoes   and your sauce   i chose to be as healthy as i could and got a veggie pasty with butternut squash  a veggie sauce  and chunky mashed potatoes with cheese and chives   our server was very friendly and the food was out quickly and tasted really delicious   the pasty was light and fluffy and full of veggies and the mash was freakin  good  we decided to dessert and split it and had an apple mash of some kind with vanilla ice cream   it had the consistency of oatmeal or something but was really good   my hubs loved it i feel like it was a good choice for our first day in london

Sorry, but I'm one more of those... warning :)We had dinner at Mother Mash during our first night in London. I loved EVERYTHING about this place! Located in the trendy neighborhood of Soho, in one of those streets with super cool hanging lights/decorations, Mother Mash is a simple place with affordable and delicious food!We tried the chicken, leek and bacon pie, as well as the aberdeen angus steak pie. Both were great! But, the absolute highlights were the mashed potatoes! The cheesy mash and the horseradish mash were both phenomenal!  I gotta say that I didn't have high expectations for traditional British food, and this place certainly changed my mind :)	it seems to me that the majority of yelp reviews in london are from americans living abroad or visiting  sorry  but i m one more of those    warning   we had dinner at mother mash during our first night in london  i loved everything about this place  located in the trendy neighborhood of soho  in one of those streets with super cool hanging lights decorations  mother mash is a simple place with affordable and delicious food we tried the chicken  leek and bacon pie  as well as the aberdeen angus steak pie  both were great  but  the absolute highlights were the mashed potatoes  the cheesy mash and the horseradish mash were both phenomenal   i gotta say that i didn t have high expectations for traditional british food  and this place certainly changed my mind   
1586	4.0	Hey being from the US I only know what we call pot pies, which are made in a pie tin using a denser U.S. biscuit like dough.  So for the meal I had the chicken and leek pie that was surrounded by a large U.S. style biscuit, very good vs. the Pub pie I had which used a puff pastry crust.  The mash was very good also (onion), but here in lies my only critique.  With a chicken pie, the gravy should be a white chicken based gravy, this is just my personal preference, and the brown gravy that was served was good.I will definably come backThanks.	hey being from the us i only know what we call pot pies  which are made in a pie tin using a denser u s  biscuit like dough   so for the meal i had the chicken and leek pie that was surrounded by a large u s  style biscuit  very good vs  the pub pie i had which used a puff pastry crust   the mash was very good also  onion   but here in lies my only critique   with a chicken pie  the gravy should be a white chicken based gravy  this is just my personal preference  and the brown gravy that was served was good i will definably come backthanks

1592	4.0	Had casual dinner here last night with my parents. Cozy place with comfort food for very fair London prices! Located in central part of Soho and close by to a lot of other hot restaurants so it can be easy to miss.The three of us got (for ~40£ overall):- Colcannon + Pork & Leek Sausage + Farmer's Gravy- Colcannon + London Smokey + Farmer's Gravy- Champ + Steak & Ale Pie + Traditional Gravy- Sticky Toffee PuddingThe family consensus was that London Smokey was the best in flavor, the Pork & Leek tasted funny and wasn't quite meaty enough, and the Steak & Ale was a solid dish to order if you've never tried it (albeit a tad salty). The potatoes were easily the best part. The sticky toffee pudding was delish and comes with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream or custard, though we were struggling to finish because of the entree portion size!I usually don't like places that ask you to pick your own combination, but Mother Mash hit the spot.	had casual dinner here last night with my parents  cozy place with comfort food for very fair london prices  located in central part of soho and close by to a lot of other hot restaurants so it can be easy to miss the three of us got  for  40  overall    colcannon   pork   leek sausage   farmer s gravy  colcannon   london smokey   farmer s gravy  champ   steak   ale pie   traditional gravy  sticky toffee puddingthe family consensus was that london smokey was the best in flavor  the pork   leek tasted funny and wasn t quite meaty enough  and the steak   ale was a solid dish to order if you ve never tried it  albeit a tad salty   the potatoes were easily the best part  the sticky toffee pudding was delish and comes with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream or custard  though we were struggling to finish because of the entree portion size i usually don t like places that ask you to pick your own combination  but mother mash hit the spot

1597	3.0	This place is only okay. I've had far better sausage and mash but perhaps I'm just spoiled by the superior selection and quality of sausage and mash a number of quintessentially British pubs in the countryside. Maybe finding decent sausage is difficult in London and I don't understand that? Either way, it's fine and inexpensive, but not great. Ordering is simple. I had three sausages with bubble and squeak. The only sausage I remember was the London smokey one which had a nice sweet smoke flavor, otherwise, the rest was forgettable. Also, not a great beer selection, but the Camden Hells is your best option.I'd recommend sitting at a table near the front with chairs instead of a booth. The booth seating is very uncomfortable and requires one to sit up perfectly straight, stiff as a board, on hard wooden slats. I suppose if someone ate here regularly, though, they'd have excellent posture!	this place is only okay  i ve had far better sausage and mash but perhaps i m just spoiled by the superior selection and quality of sausage and mash a number of quintessentially british pubs in the countryside  maybe finding decent sausage is difficult in london and i don t understand that  either way  it s fine and inexpensive  but not great  ordering is simple  i had three sausages with bubble and squeak  the only sausage i remember was the london smokey one which had a nice sweet smoke flavor  otherwise  the rest was forgettable  also  not a great beer selection  but the camden hells is your best option i d recommend sitting at a table near the front with chairs instead of a booth  the booth seating is very uncomfortable and requires one to sit up perfectly straight  stiff as a board  on hard wooden slats  i suppose if someone ate here regularly  though  they d have excellent posture

1599	5.0	My first out-of-country Yelp review! First off let me explain that I'm a foreigner from America. This was also my first time in London. After a long flight, brothers and I went to venture out in London with 1 thing on our mind: Bangers and Mash. We searched Yelp for the best one around and Mother Mash came up.We walked in and we were immediately seated. It was not busy at all when we arrived, but upon departure more and more people flew in.It took us about 5 minutes for us to decide what to get. For me I got the champ mash, with London smokey sausage, and traditional gravy. It took 7-8 minutes for our food to arrive which was very fast!Before we dug into our food, our waiter mentioned they had mustard (which was very zesty), and a sauce that was still foreign to us called HP sauce which was very sweet and tangy. My brother and I were in disbelief of the taste and flavor coming from our food. The potatoes were soft and had cheddar cheese and the crunch of the green onion, the sausage was unbelievably tender,  and the sauce was so perfect.We then got our bill, we paid, and left to explore London.Let's just say if I were to have a last meal on earth, I would go to Mother Mash.

Warm, cozy menu-multiple varieties of mashed potatoes, meat pies, and sausages all drenched in a variety of gravies. Lots of vegetarian options too! Our server was adorable, cutest British accent, and answered all our American questions patiently. The cauliflower with cheese was to die for. The bubble and squeak and the colcannon were delicious! The puddings tempted us to lick our plates! When we didn't understand what was meant by custard, our waitress make sure that we got some to try.  Only thing that would make this place better would be some draft ciders and beers, everything is in bottles. The location is in an adorably quaint and funky alley in the Carnaby area. Prices are super reasonable and portions are large.

I understand that pies are absolutely considered a British Classic, and the pie-place to go to is Mother Mash. Not only is this place hilariously well priced (Central London, after all) but the pies are absolutely delicious, juicy, and tender. the mash potatoes are perfect (I highly recommend bubble and squeak), and the gravy is on point! I plan to visit this place at least once every time I go to London, and this past visit I actually ordered myself an extra pie to eat the next morning as breakfast (Sorry, I'm shameless).	i must admit that my recent visit was actually my second visit to mother mash  which should be self explanatory to why i m giving it 5 stars  i understand that pies are absolutely considered a british classic  and the pie place to go to is mother mash  not only is this place hilariously well priced  central london  after all  but the pies are absolutely delicious  juicy  and tender  the mash potatoes are perfect  i highly recommend bubble and squeak   and the gravy is on point  i plan to visit this place at least once every time i go to london  and this past visit i actually ordered myself an extra pie to eat the next morning as breakfast  sorry  i m shameless  
1606	5.0	Thanks Yelp for recommending this place! My American boyfriend was visiting and wanted to sample some 'real British' pie, sausage and mash, so we looked up the reviews and picked out this place together, as the glowing comments sounded promising. I was a little apprehensive as my only experience of sausage and mash was watery, pale school dinners, so naturally I didn't quite share his excitement. We arrived at 5pm on a Monday with the place to ourselves and were seated in one of the little cubbyhole booths - I imagine this place would be so cramped when it gets busy, as there isn't that much space! Staff seemed friendly and polite enough and we were served promptly with no issues at all. I did like the 'pick-and-mix' style of the menu, allowing you to pick and choose your mash, main and gravy for a brilliantly custom experience. There are a generous number of vegetarian options, so any non-meat-eater definitely won't feel left out. I decided to go for cheesy mash, Lincolnshire sausage and traditional gravy, whilst my boyfriend opted for the same but with an Aberdeen Angus pie in addition to sausages, with mushy peas on the side (we were so hungry after walking around London all day). The food was everything I could have hoped for and more, a far cry from the grey dinner hall mashed potato and sausage! Mash was creamy and delicious, the sausages and gravy were flavourful, and I could have easily had more (although my portion was just enough for me). My boyfriend is a huge foodie and can be very critical of what he eats (not to mention spoiled for choice at home) - he said it was incredible and his favourite meal of the trip. Saying a lot, as we'd had some truly excellent other food that I assumed couldn't be beat! We decided to skip dessert as it would've been too much, paying less than £30 between us, very reasonable for such a great restaurant meal right in the middle of London.I'd absolutely recommend Mother Mash to anyone else looking for some incredible and very British pie and mash in the middle of London - I promise you won't be disappointed!	thanks yelp for recommending this place  my american boyfriend was visiting and wanted to sample some  real british  pie  sausage and mash  so we looked up the reviews and picked out this place together  as the glowing comments sounded promising  i was a little apprehensive as my only experience of sausage and mash was watery  pale school dinners  so naturally i didn t quite share his excitement  we arrived at 5pm on a monday with the place to ourselves and were seated in one of the little cubbyhole booths   i imagine this place would be so cramped when it gets busy  as there isn t that much space  staff seemed friendly and polite enough and we were served promptly with no issues at all  i did like the  pick and mix  style of the menu  allowing you to pick and choose your mash  main and gravy for a brilliantly custom experience  there are a generous number of vegetarian options  so any non meat eater definitely won t feel left out  i decided to go for cheesy mash  lincolnshire sausage and traditional gravy  whilst my boyfriend opted for the same but with an aberdeen angus pie in addition to sausages  with mushy peas on the side  we were so hungry after walking around london all day   the food was everything i could have hoped for and more  a far cry from the grey dinner hall mashed potato and sausage  mash was creamy and delicious  the sausages and gravy were flavourful  and i could have easily had more  although my portion was just enough for me   my boyfriend is a huge foodie and can be very critical of what he eats  not to mention spoiled for choice at home    he said it was incredible and his favourite meal of the trip  saying a lot  as we d had some truly excellent other food that i assumed couldn t be beat  we decided to skip dessert as it would ve been too much  paying less than  30 between us  very reasonable for such a great restaurant meal right in the middle of london i d absolutely recommend mother mash to anyone else looking for some incredible and very british pie and mash in the middle of london   i promise you won t be disappointed 
1607	4.0	Since my hubby and I got to London, we were dying to try thing some local dishes, so we looked it up online which near us at that moment. Mother Mash showed up.  After we saw couple pics of this, we decided to give it a try. The restaurant actually located it at Soho district, yeah right, another place we wanted to visit. Checked! It took us couple turns we finally found the restaurant. Well, tell you a easier way to find it, when you pass the alley that which lots of light bulbs between the building then you know you are in the right place.The restaurant was smaller than I expected, but we came for the food anyway. We picked a seat outside, it didn't take long the waitress already with us. I was kind of new to this food. They also got a interesting was for ordering, basically you can DIY want you like to have on your dish, quite a fresh idea. I did ask the waitress she recommend me some stuff. I sort of forgot the name by now. It was something with premium sausages. Well, like I said, it was a DIY set. I really like how it tasted. It was really different and I like it a lot, I also ordered a Ginger beer, nice drink as well. My hubby also enjoyed his ordered as well, which it was good, usually he isn't a fan of British cuisine. The generally cost wasn't so high here as well and we like the location. The stuff were really friendly as well. If you're also looking for something local food to try out, this might be the place for this.	since my hubby and i got to london  we were dying to try thing some local dishes  so we looked it up online which near us at that moment  mother mash showed up   after we saw couple pics of this  we decided to give it a try  the restaurant actually located it at soho district  yeah right  another place we wanted to visit  checked  it took us couple turns we finally found the restaurant  well  tell you a easier way to find it  when you pass the alley that which lots of light bulbs between the building then you know you are in the right place the restaurant was smaller than i expected  but we came for the food anyway  we picked a seat outside  it didn t take long the waitress already with us  i was kind of new to this food  they also got a interesting was for ordering  basically you can diy want you like to have on your dish  quite a fresh idea  i did ask the waitress she recommend me some stuff  i sort of forgot the name by now  it was something with premium sausages  well  like i said  it was a diy set  i really like how it tasted  it was really different and i like it a lot  i also ordered a ginger beer  nice drink as well  my hubby also enjoyed his ordered as well  which it was good  usually he isn t a fan of british cuisine  the generally cost wasn t so high here as well and we like the location  the stuff were really friendly as well  if you re also looking for something local food to try out  this might be the place for this 
1608	5.0	I ordered the bubble and squeak mash. Soo good! The london sausage had a ton of flavor and was surprisingly not greasy. The farmers gravy was insanely tasty. My girlfriend ordered the mustard mash. She liked it but it didn't come close in taste to the bubbles n squeak. Her minced meat pie was overall good. Crust was flaky and tasty but meat could have used a bit more flavor. Service was friendly and European style. Place may get packed, but imo its worth to wait for a spot.	i ordered the bubble and squeak mash  soo good  the london sausage had a ton of flavor and was surprisingly not greasy  the farmers gravy was insanely tasty  my girlfriend ordered the mustard mash  she liked it but it didn t come close in taste to the bubbles n squeak  her minced meat pie was overall good  crust was flaky and tasty but meat could have used a bit more flavor  service was friendly and european style  place may get packed  but imo its worth to wait for a spot 
1609	5.0	I Am giving this 5 stars because not only was the food good but our service was great. We loved our server Ash who gave us really fun things to do around the city. We both ordered things off her suggestions and we were not disappointed. Also a great thing about this restaurant is that they have non dairy alternatives which I feel like it's hard to find in Europe. The nondairy option still tasted great which can be hard to do for mash.And even though after dinner we were stuffed we both got the sticky toffee pudding which was to die for. The restaurant was nice and simple and the bathrooms were clean. We had a good time and good food.	i am giving this 5 stars because not only was the food good but our service was great  we loved our server ash who gave us really fun things to do around the city  we both ordered things off her suggestions and we were not disappointed  also a great thing about this restaurant is that they have non dairy alternatives which i feel like it s hard to find in europe  the nondairy option still tasted great which can be hard to do for mash and even though after dinner we were stuffed we both got the sticky toffee pudding which was to die for  the restaurant was nice and simple and the bathrooms were clean  we had a good time and good food

Only downside is the service from the staff, they were a little rude (said they were short staffed). Hopefully this was just a one off incident.	the food was absolutely amazing  great choice on the menu  i would highly recommend this small find  only downside is the service from the staff  they were a little rude  said they were short staffed   hopefully this was just a one off incident

1612	4.0	After reading some good reviews on this sausage and mash restaurant. I went there to experience myself ...the reviews was absolutely right...it was very tasty and delicious. The menu come with different choice of mash, sausages and gravy sauce. Try to avoid lunch time to go there as it is always busy. Also they do take away for those who work at surrounding area. A lovely traditional British restaurant  and reasonable price. I would go again.	after reading some good reviews on this sausage and mash restaurant  i went there to experience myself    the reviews was absolutely right   it was very tasty and delicious  the menu come with different choice of mash  sausages and gravy sauce  try to avoid lunch time to go there as it is always busy  also they do take away for those who work at surrounding area  a lovely traditional british restaurant  and reasonable price  i would go again

The mash is authentic and the British pie is delicious! Worth every penny. When you come be sure to check out the special of the day as well.I recommend the angus steak pie with farmer's gravy and colcannon mash.	i m writing this review since this is my second time here in 10 12 days  this place is amazing and a must to visit while you re in soho  the mash is authentic and the british pie is delicious  worth every penny  when you come be sure to check out the special of the day as well i recommend the angus steak pie with farmer s gravy and colcannon mash 
1614	4.0	A cosy little place on Ganton Street near to Carnaby Street.6 of us managing to fit into the biggest table in the restaurant. There's a reason I called it cost....Between us we tried 2 different sausages, 3 different types of pie, 5 different mash potatoes and 4 different gravies. I can't fault the place. The staff were friendly, the food was quick, hot and delicious. They even sell local beer from Sambrooks, Fullers and Meantime breweries. It would be a great pre-theatre food venue with dinner and a drink for about £15.Highly recommended by me and my 5 friends.	a cosy little place on ganton street near to carnaby street 6 of us managing to fit into the biggest table in the restaurant  there s a reason i called it cost    between us we tried 2 different sausages  3 different types of pie  5 different mash potatoes and 4 different gravies  i can t fault the place  the staff were friendly  the food was quick  hot and delicious  they even sell local beer from sambrooks  fullers and meantime breweries  it would be a great pre theatre food venue with dinner and a drink for about  15 highly recommended by me and my 5 friends 
1615	3.0	"I love this place's food, but it's so hard to give this place 4 stars as so many things went wrong.If you want to try really good food that you can probably get in a pub, come here! And more significantly, if you are a vegetarian and have always wanted to try a savory pie and mash, run here! However, no matter how fast you run, the service might move at a pace slow enough to induce one's hangry alter ego.I had the cheddar mash with a special sausage (lamb and honey mustard) with traditional gravy and my vegetarian girlfriend had traditional mash with the Mediterranean veggie savory pie and the vegetarian gravy. Both were excellent.Now on to the negatives...There were 3 or 4 groups (one was a party of 7) in this fairly small establishment that had 2 servers. all of the groups got there at different times and it should have been manageable. It took more than 10 or 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and greet us... And they kept coming by mouthing ""one second"" and then continuing to provide service to tables that had already been helped. It seemed like a mismanagement of how to engage with customers because tasks like distributing silverware if the meal is not yet ready seem like they should be delayed to greet new customers.Anyhow... We finally got our order in and it took quite a long time to receive drinks. All of this is not enough to warrant 3 stars, as I really do like the food and I think this is forgivable... But the peculiar thing is what unfolded next.As the party of 7 received their food, I said to my girlfriend ""it must be difficult to know what dish belongs to what person since the pies and mash all look the same"" and then 3 people at that table were given the wrong orders! Then my girlfriend was given an incorrect pie in her order... Luckily it was still vegetarian, but they were kind and replaced it... But then the tables in front and behind us both had messed up orders! How does that happen 4 times in a row? Id be careful ordering takeout here... This was our second time coming to mother mash and we loved the food both times. The service the second time made the experience feel like a third, decisive visit is required some time in the future."	i love this place s food  but it s so hard to give this place 4 stars as so many things went wrong if you want to try really good food that you can probably get in a pub  come here  and more significantly  if you are a vegetarian and have always wanted to try a savory pie and mash  run here  however  no matter how fast you run  the service might move at a pace slow enough to induce one s hangry alter ego i had the cheddar mash with a special sausage  lamb and honey mustard  with traditional gravy and my vegetarian girlfriend had traditional mash with the mediterranean veggie savory pie and the vegetarian gravy  both were excellent now on to the negatives   there were 3 or 4 groups  one was a party of 7  in this fairly small establishment that had 2 servers  all of the groups got there at different times and it should have been manageable  it took more than 10 or 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and greet us    and they kept coming by mouthing  one second  and then continuing to provide service to tables that had already been helped  it seemed like a mismanagement of how to engage with customers because tasks like distributing silverware if the meal is not yet ready seem like they should be delayed to greet new customers anyhow    we finally got our order in and it took quite a long time to receive drinks  all of this is not enough to warrant 3 stars  as i really do like the food and i think this is forgivable    but the peculiar thing is what unfolded next as the party of 7 received their food  i said to my girlfriend  it must be difficult to know what dish belongs to what person since the pies and mash all look the same  and then 3 people at that table were given the wrong orders  then my girlfriend was given an incorrect pie in her order    luckily it was still vegetarian  but they were kind and replaced it    but then the tables in front and behind us both had messed up orders  how does that happen 4 times in a row  id be careful ordering takeout here    this was our second time coming to mother mash and we loved the food both times  the service the second time made the experience feel like a third  decisive visit is required some time in the future

The waiter heard us talking and ask where we were from, we finished the night listening to the beach boys and talking about Southern California with him and made us feel right at home.	so in london you eat bangers and mash  right we took a causal stroll thru soho and we stumbled in to this amazing place  staff was wonderful  food was out of this world  the waiter heard us talking and ask where we were from  we finished the night listening to the beach boys and talking about southern california with him and made us feel right at home 
1617	4.0	As a tourist, I had to try authentic British cuisine. That is why I decided to try Mother Mash. I ordered the Bubble and Squeak mash, Chicken and Garlic sausages with traditional gravy. The sausages had a nice outer layer and nice flavors. The mash seemed to be fried since it had a nice crust on it, as well. But together, the flavors married in a very lovely way. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they Card reader wasn't working and I had to fine a cash machine.	as a tourist  i had to try authentic british cuisine  that is why i decided to try mother mash  i ordered the bubble and squeak mash  chicken and garlic sausages with traditional gravy  the sausages had a nice outer layer and nice flavors  the mash seemed to be fried since it had a nice crust on it  as well  but together  the flavors married in a very lovely way  the only reason i gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they card reader wasn t working and i had to fine a cash machine

1619	3.0	On the recommendation of some Local Guides we decided to stop here for a quick bite before going out for the evening. All in all? If you want pie and mash then it's a pretty good place to come. (They also do sausages) I ordered the cheddar mash with the steak pie and the traditional gravy with a side of cauliflower cheese. The pie had quite a lot of filling (always a bonus), the gravy was tasty and the mash was really flavourful too. They do offer the option of 'smooth' or normal mashed potato. I went with smooth and do wish that I had gone with the other option as it was just a little too pureed for my liking. I didn't really rate the cauliflower cheese. In terms of decor and comfort, it is pretty much a fast food place and you're not going to spend a lot of time here but for a quick, filling bite on a cold evening? It's pretty good.	on the recommendation of some local guides we decided to stop here for a quick bite before going out for the evening  all in all  if you want pie and mash then it s a pretty good place to come   they also do sausages  i ordered the cheddar mash with the steak pie and the traditional gravy with a side of cauliflower cheese  the pie had quite a lot of filling  always a bonus   the gravy was tasty and the mash was really flavourful too  they do offer the option of  smooth  or normal mashed potato  i went with smooth and do wish that i had gone with the other option as it was just a little too pureed for my liking  i didn t really rate the cauliflower cheese  in terms of decor and comfort  it is pretty much a fast food place and you re not going to spend a lot of time here but for a quick  filling bite on a cold evening  it s pretty good 
1620	4.0	"Last April, I traveled to London with a group of about 32 people. This was the first spot  where we ate dinner. I was a bit apprehensive at first. I'd heard all the rumors about British food being awful. Mother Mash totally broke that stereotype! The restaurant is small, but they were able to host our entire group with two small tables to spare. Our food was brought out promptly.  They had a vegetarian meat pie for me! Yum! It was the perfect portion. The mash was smooth, comforting and paired well with the flaky ""meat"" pie. The gravy wasn't too salty but more than what I'd usually pour on my mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed my dinner at Mother Mash and I'm happy that our tour group took us to local places instead of the cookie cutter tour restaurants. You know I'll be back when I'm in London!"	last april  i traveled to london with a group of about 32 people  this was the first spot  where we ate dinner  i was a bit apprehensive at first  i d heard all the rumors about british food being awful  mother mash totally broke that stereotype  the restaurant is small  but they were able to host our entire group with two small tables to spare  our food was brought out promptly   they had a vegetarian meat pie for me  yum  it was the perfect portion  the mash was smooth  comforting and paired well with the flaky  meat  pie  the gravy wasn t too salty but more than what i d usually pour on my mashed potatoes  i really enjoyed my dinner at mother mash and i m happy that our tour group took us to local places instead of the cookie cutter tour restaurants  you know i ll be back when i m in london

1622	2.0	Really surprised at the good reviews for this place. The best word to describe this place is Overpriced... 10 pounds for pie and mash is easily the most I paid of the several times I had pie/mash on my trip. But the thing is the quality didn't justify the price. The pie was especially average. I think the worst pie of my trip. The meat was on the dry side. The mash was pretty good, but not fantastic. Given the location and price, I think that this place targets tourists (in fact it seemed to be mainly tourists when I visited). Get your pie/mash at a pub... better atmosphere/ better price/ better taste.	really surprised at the good reviews for this place  the best word to describe this place is overpriced    10 pounds for pie and mash is easily the most i paid of the several times i had pie mash on my trip  but the thing is the quality didn t justify the price  the pie was especially average  i think the worst pie of my trip  the meat was on the dry side  the mash was pretty good  but not fantastic  given the location and price  i think that this place targets tourists  in fact it seemed to be mainly tourists when i visited   get your pie mash at a pub    better atmosphere  better price  better taste

Very tasty and succulent chicken pie with silky, buttery mash and a pool of the most flavoursome gravy. My soul was definitely satiated.

1630	4.0	I seldom have a craving for such fatty, filling, stodgy English food, but last week was an exception. Mother mash is a small unassuming restaurant which serves traditional English fare with a gastro pub-feel. Conveniently located in Soho, this would be great for an autumnal dinner to recover from Oxford/Regent street shopping. There is ample seating inside and a couple of tables outside. The menu is simple but good. Bangers and mash or pie and mash. Choose your pie or bangers, choose your mash. The cheesy mustard mash looked particularly interesting. I went for the vegetarian butternut squash pie with sweet potato mash and onion gravy. For about a tenner, a filling meal though not too stodgy, the pie was very tasty and service was pretty quick. My friend got a meaty option and also really enjoyed it.Friendly service, quite loud, I would come back.	i seldom have a craving for such fatty  filling  stodgy english food  but last week was an exception  mother mash is a small unassuming restaurant which serves traditional english fare with a gastro pub feel  conveniently located in soho  this would be great for an autumnal dinner to recover from oxford regent street shopping  there is ample seating inside and a couple of tables outside  the menu is simple but good  bangers and mash or pie and mash  choose your pie or bangers  choose your mash  the cheesy mustard mash looked particularly interesting  i went for the vegetarian butternut squash pie with sweet potato mash and onion gravy  for about a tenner  a filling meal though not too stodgy  the pie was very tasty and service was pretty quick  my friend got a meaty option and also really enjoyed it friendly service  quite loud  i would come back 
1631	4.0	This is probably the most refined bangers and mash I've ever had. Full disclosure I haven't had many.  I had the mash with cheddar and spring onions.  Lots of onions yum.  Didn't taste any cheddar. Traditional gravy flavor profile perfect though I wish it were a fraction thicker in consistency.  I asked for the 2 most popular sausages.  I was given a London smokey and cumberland.  I would order 2 cumberland next time.  London smokey was a bit smaller and a bit overcooked.  Otherwise great food service a bit slow.  I would return.	this is probably the most refined bangers and mash i ve ever had  full disclosure i haven t had many   i had the mash with cheddar and spring onions   lots of onions yum   didn t taste any cheddar  traditional gravy flavor profile perfect though i wish it were a fraction thicker in consistency   i asked for the 2 most popular sausages   i was given a london smokey and cumberland   i would order 2 cumberland next time   london smokey was a bit smaller and a bit overcooked   otherwise great food service a bit slow   i would return 
1632	4.0	Popped into Mother Mash for a quick dinner on a Tuesday evening.  The place was pretty full with a lively atmosphere.  Such a charming location in Carnaby Market.  It's pretty small, with about 4-5 booths in the back and a few 2-4 seater tables in front.  It has about 4-6 tables outside too.  The menu is very simple and is divided into 4 categories.  First you pick your style of mash, then your sausage or pie then your gravy.  Then you add any sides you wish.  My husband and I weren't that hungry, so we decided to split a meal.  We went with cheesy mash, steak pie, traditional gravy and a side of baked beans.  The mash was super creamy with a great hint of cheddar cheese.  The pie was great, with a warm flaky crust and a savory steak filling.  Gravy was good - not great. And the beans were good - again, not great, just plain.  We both thought the meal was great, just heavy on the salt!  We left very thirsty as everything was very high in sodium.  Great flavors, I'd just take it back a notch in the salt department. Overall, we were very pleased.  The best part is the price.  Our total was £11!  The portions were very generous and if we weren't splitting, there was no way I could finish a meal on my own.  It was a fun place to try and is a great affordable option for the area!	popped into mother mash for a quick dinner on a tuesday evening   the place was pretty full with a lively atmosphere   such a charming location in carnaby market   it s pretty small  with about 4 5 booths in the back and a few 2 4 seater tables in front   it has about 4 6 tables outside too   the menu is very simple and is divided into 4 categories   first you pick your style of mash  then your sausage or pie then your gravy   then you add any sides you wish   my husband and i weren t that hungry  so we decided to split a meal   we went with cheesy mash  steak pie  traditional gravy and a side of baked beans   the mash was super creamy with a great hint of cheddar cheese   the pie was great  with a warm flaky crust and a savory steak filling   gravy was good   not great  and the beans were good   again  not great  just plain   we both thought the meal was great  just heavy on the salt   we left very thirsty as everything was very high in sodium   great flavors  i d just take it back a notch in the salt department  overall  we were very pleased   the best part is the price   our total was  11   the portions were very generous and if we weren t splitting  there was no way i could finish a meal on my own   it was a fun place to try and is a great affordable option for the area 
1633	4.0	I have spent most of my time in London trying to recapture the culinary experience I had in Singapore. In an effort to embrace the more local cuisine rather than that of east Asia, I decided to find a place that had a predominantly English/British menu, which lead me to Mother Mash. This restaurant is tucked away from the bustling shopping streets on a pedestrian-only street. Its a nice little restaurant with a few tables outside on the street. I came at about 4PM on a weekday so it was practically empty. I sat at the small bar seating facing the window and looked at the menu. It's a formula-style menu- choose one from column A, column B, and column C. The first column being style of mashed potatoes, then your type of sausage or pie, and the type of gravy. I really wanted to try their sweet potato mash but it was unavailable so I went for the cheesy mash with the angus steak pie and farmer's gravy. My food came out quite quickly and the first thing I noticed is that the presentation was quite nice. A nice surprise for such an affordable restaurant! I dug right in.The cheesy potatoes were even cheesier than I expected. They were almost sticky with cheese. The steak pie was nice and meaty, and paired well with the tangy, meaty flavor of the farmer's gravy. Everything went together nicely, and I can imagine that almost every menu combination would come out great. Service was alright- nothing much to say about it either way. The price for the meal is very reasonable and the serving was quite substantial. While I'm sure that even better British fare could be found elsewhere, this is a hearty, tasty meal to have if you're in the area.	i have spent most of my time in london trying to recapture the culinary experience i had in singapore  in an effort to embrace the more local cuisine rather than that of east asia  i decided to find a place that had a predominantly english british menu  which lead me to mother mash  this restaurant is tucked away from the bustling shopping streets on a pedestrian only street  its a nice little restaurant with a few tables outside on the street  i came at about 4pm on a weekday so it was practically empty  i sat at the small bar seating facing the window and looked at the menu  it s a formula style menu  choose one from column a  column b  and column c  the first column being style of mashed potatoes  then your type of sausage or pie  and the type of gravy  i really wanted to try their sweet potato mash but it was unavailable so i went for the cheesy mash with the angus steak pie and farmer s gravy  my food came out quite quickly and the first thing i noticed is that the presentation was quite nice  a nice surprise for such an affordable restaurant  i dug right in the cheesy potatoes were even cheesier than i expected  they were almost sticky with cheese  the steak pie was nice and meaty  and paired well with the tangy  meaty flavor of the farmer s gravy  everything went together nicely  and i can imagine that almost every menu combination would come out great  service was alright  nothing much to say about it either way  the price for the meal is very reasonable and the serving was quite substantial  while i m sure that even better british fare could be found elsewhere  this is a hearty  tasty meal to have if you re in the area 
1634	3.0	Finally got to try some bangers and mash. Mother's Mash is simple, yet delicious traditional British food. It's a one dish meal consisting of mashed potatoes, sausage or meat pie, and gravy. I got the mashed potatoes with cabbage, lamb stew pie, and onion gravy. We also ordered the steak and Guinness sausage with farmer's gravy, pork and cider pie with farmer's gravy, Angus steak pie with mashed sweet potatoe in a regular gravy. Highly recommend the mashed sweet potato for something different-creamy and lightly sweet but balanced with the savory gravy. The pork and cider pie had very good flavors while my dad said the Guinness steak sausage was a little tough. We also ordered a side of French green beans which were well made but such a small handful. The restaurant itself is small and narrow with a couple of outdoor seating. Inside it's diner car seating style with wooden benches with a marble tabletops. Fun artwork decorate the bright white walls. It can get a little warm in there but rooftop windows are open to let whatever breeze can get in on a warm British summer. All in all, I recommend this place if you want to try some good traditional English food.	finally got to try some bangers and mash  mother s mash is simple  yet delicious traditional british food  it s a one dish meal consisting of mashed potatoes  sausage or meat pie  and gravy  i got the mashed potatoes with cabbage  lamb stew pie  and onion gravy  we also ordered the steak and guinness sausage with farmer s gravy  pork and cider pie with farmer s gravy  angus steak pie with mashed sweet potatoe in a regular gravy  highly recommend the mashed sweet potato for something different creamy and lightly sweet but balanced with the savory gravy  the pork and cider pie had very good flavors while my dad said the guinness steak sausage was a little tough  we also ordered a side of french green beans which were well made but such a small handful  the restaurant itself is small and narrow with a couple of outdoor seating  inside it s diner car seating style with wooden benches with a marble tabletops  fun artwork decorate the bright white walls  it can get a little warm in there but rooftop windows are open to let whatever breeze can get in on a warm british summer  all in all  i recommend this place if you want to try some good traditional english food

1637	3.0	If you're looking for some filling comfort food for a reasonable price, this could be the place for you. The formula is pretty straight forward; mash, pies, sausage and gravy. There's not an awful lot of room to go wrong. With bench cubby seating, I can imagine on the weekends this little place gets quite busy but is a lot bigger than you may initially believe when walking past. So I don't think there would be much trouble finding yourself a cosy little spot to fill your belly.The menu has a wide range of different sausages and pies, even enough to keep a keen vegetarian happy - they offer veggie gravy too - along with an inventive selection of mashed potatoes. Just one word of advise, if you're not the kind of person who loves baby paste textured mash, ask for it with a bit more texture. They can do this for you no problem, but it's worth remembering to ask! All in all, it's a great little place for a hearty meal, piping hot and definitely a British home comfort.	if you re looking for some filling comfort food for a reasonable price  this could be the place for you  the formula is pretty straight forward  mash  pies  sausage and gravy  there s not an awful lot of room to go wrong  with bench cubby seating  i can imagine on the weekends this little place gets quite busy but is a lot bigger than you may initially believe when walking past  so i don t think there would be much trouble finding yourself a cosy little spot to fill your belly the menu has a wide range of different sausages and pies  even enough to keep a keen vegetarian happy   they offer veggie gravy too   along with an inventive selection of mashed potatoes  just one word of advise  if you re not the kind of person who loves baby paste textured mash  ask for it with a bit more texture  they can do this for you no problem  but it s worth remembering to ask  all in all  it s a great little place for a hearty meal  piping hot and definitely a british home comfort

Mother Mash is definitely one of those places that does not necessarily define British food but does graze over a few of their known dishes. I ordered their CHEESY MUSTARD MASH, with a CHICKEN, LEEK, & BACON PIE. The crust was perfectly made, and the inside was just as creamy/ delicious. After our main dishes we could not help ourselves to a bit of something sweet. For dessert we had the APPLE CRUMBLE. Great dessert! A bit on the sweet side from what I like, but still enjoyable. I had to give the restaurant 3 stars, because instead of telling us in the beginning what they were out of, we ordered, and the waitress would come back and say ""Oh, we don't have it."" There was a lot of back and forth, and we had to ask for water 3 times before we actually got it. Overall, the restaurant was good, and I highly recommend checking this restaurant out.

Our meal was delivered quickly. We shared the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious as well. They also have free wifi, just ask the server for the password.	amazing taste  the best british meal that we ve had so far  i had the steak and ale pie with champ mash and traditional gravy  the chunks of steak were incredibly tender  our meal was delivered quickly  we shared the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious as well  they also have free wifi  just ask the server for the password

Overall I thought the food was ok but nothing great. It didn't seem special or different from anything else that I had eaten before in the US. The food wasn't bad but it also wasn't that great or amazing.If you have a limited amount of time in London, I would use a meal eating somewhere else. There wasn't anything unique about this place and there's so many other good options in the city.	i was visiting london and the soho area so i decided to check out this restaurant based on the reviews  i wanted to check out this place because i wanted to eat something british  overall i thought the food was ok but nothing great  it didn t seem special or different from anything else that i had eaten before in the us  the food wasn t bad but it also wasn t that great or amazing if you have a limited amount of time in london  i would use a meal eating somewhere else  there wasn t anything unique about this place and there s so many other good options in the city 
1645	3.0	Came to London for a week and wanted to try some british food.  Mother Mash is situated in the heart of soho, with lots of trendy shops and restaurants near by.  Ordering is a simple 3 steps, first you choose your mash, then you choose either sausage or pie, and lastly you choose the type of gravy.I wanted to be safe with my choice so i went with the classic mash with traditional minced beef pie and traditional gravy.  The star was definitely the mash, it was very smooth and fluffy.  The gravy was very flavorful and rich as well.  However the pie was a little disappointment for me as I would like my pie crust to be more flaky but their pie was a bit chewy and doughy for my taste and the filling was a bit on the bland side also, luckily the gravy saved the dish.  Overall their pie and mash tasted a lot better than the ones I got from a british pub the night before, but their food didnt really blow me away either...definitely check out this place if you are interested to try some british comfort food!	came to london for a week and wanted to try some british food   mother mash is situated in the heart of soho  with lots of trendy shops and restaurants near by   ordering is a simple 3 steps  first you choose your mash  then you choose either sausage or pie  and lastly you choose the type of gravy i wanted to be safe with my choice so i went with the classic mash with traditional minced beef pie and traditional gravy   the star was definitely the mash  it was very smooth and fluffy   the gravy was very flavorful and rich as well   however the pie was a little disappointment for me as i would like my pie crust to be more flaky but their pie was a bit chewy and doughy for my taste and the filling was a bit on the bland side also  luckily the gravy saved the dish   overall their pie and mash tasted a lot better than the ones i got from a british pub the night before  but their food didnt really blow me away either   definitely check out this place if you are interested to try some british comfort food 
1646	5.0	Found this place on a cold and rainy February night as we searched for dinner before theater. We were early in the evening and were immediately seated. The menu is wonderfully diverse in it's offerings. You choose your mash, I had the Champ and my companion chose the cheesy mustard. Then you choose your main, I chose the Aberdeen Angus Steak pie and my companion chose the Traditional Mince Beef pie. Now you choose your gravy and we both went with the Farmer's. What a lovely, flavorful and hearty winter meal it was. The portions are generous and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I would recommend this pie shop for any visitor to London in search of a traditional style pie at a very reasonable price.	found this place on a cold and rainy february night as we searched for dinner before theater  we were early in the evening and were immediately seated  the menu is wonderfully diverse in it s offerings  you choose your mash  i had the champ and my companion chose the cheesy mustard  then you choose your main  i chose the aberdeen angus steak pie and my companion chose the traditional mince beef pie  now you choose your gravy and we both went with the farmer s  what a lovely  flavorful and hearty winter meal it was  the portions are generous and the wait staff was friendly and attentive  i would recommend this pie shop for any visitor to london in search of a traditional style pie at a very reasonable price 
1647	4.0	On an unusually busy Tuesday night in Soho Mother Mash was the only place at 7pm that had available seating for dinner.  I usually find this a little bit suspect when all the other dining options in the area have minimum 20 minute queues outside the door, but I was hungry and needed to sit and eat straight away.Whilst the service got off to a rather slow start (and, as it turned out, ended off real slow), it picked up a bit and the wait staff were lovely and attentive.  Even going to the bar next door to get me a straw.The menu is fairly simple, you pick a mash, then a pie/sausages, and finish off by picking a gravy.  There are set meat and vegetarian options, with a daily specials board.I ordered the champ mash, the aberdeen steak pie, with farmers gravy.  It.  Was.  Delicious.  The mash was smooth and creamy, the gravy thick and flavoursome.  The pie was well filled with very tender meat, and the pastry was just right.For the price I will definitely be back to try the rest of the sausage/pie/mash/gravy combos.	on an unusually busy tuesday night in soho mother mash was the only place at 7pm that had available seating for dinner   i usually find this a little bit suspect when all the other dining options in the area have minimum 20 minute queues outside the door  but i was hungry and needed to sit and eat straight away whilst the service got off to a rather slow start  and  as it turned out  ended off real slow   it picked up a bit and the wait staff were lovely and attentive   even going to the bar next door to get me a straw the menu is fairly simple  you pick a mash  then a pie sausages  and finish off by picking a gravy   there are set meat and vegetarian options  with a daily specials board i ordered the champ mash  the aberdeen steak pie  with farmers gravy   it   was   delicious   the mash was smooth and creamy  the gravy thick and flavoursome   the pie was well filled with very tender meat  and the pastry was just right for the price i will definitely be back to try the rest of the sausage pie mash gravy combos

Simple, quick, wallet friendly, with great service.We asked at least a dozen questions on the menu and items, which was met with patience and great answers. An order misunderstanding was handled quickly by the business and comped accordingly.The food was flavorful and fresh. Lots of interesting options and combinations to experiment with. No complaints. The food may not blow you away like some places - it's not gourmet, it's British comfort food - and it's done very well.

1649	5.0	Everything that I ate at Mother Mash was so delightfully yummy that I WEEP over the fact that I live on the other side of the globe, never to experience such deliciousness again--at least until my next trip to London.I ordered for the bangers and mash combo with classic mash, Lincolnshire sausages, and farmer's gravy. It was all amazing, the farmer's gravy especially so. I cannot recommend it enough. For dessert I opted for a sticky toffee pudding with custard, also mind-numbingly good. The restaurant itself is cute and casual. At first I was a little unnerved by the high booths, but once I figured out there was a bar underneath to rest your feet on all was right with the world. Service was good, and if you don't go crazy with the ordering like I did (there was some alcohol purchased in addition to the delicious eats) it's very easy to dine for under £10.If I ever have the opportunity to go back to London, Mother Mash will definitely be on my must visit list!	everything that i ate at mother mash was so delightfully yummy that i weep over the fact that i live on the other side of the globe  never to experience such deliciousness again  at least until my next trip to london i ordered for the bangers and mash combo with classic mash  lincolnshire sausages  and farmer s gravy  it was all amazing  the farmer s gravy especially so  i cannot recommend it enough  for dessert i opted for a sticky toffee pudding with custard  also mind numbingly good  the restaurant itself is cute and casual  at first i was a little unnerved by the high booths  but once i figured out there was a bar underneath to rest your feet on all was right with the world  service was good  and if you don t go crazy with the ordering like i did  there was some alcohol purchased in addition to the delicious eats  it s very easy to dine for under  10 if i ever have the opportunity to go back to london  mother mash will definitely be on my must visit list

Horse radish one is pretty good too!The BangersI had Lamb and mint, Pork Leek, duck cognac and spicy pork. All of them were good! I enjoyed the duck cognac the most but it was a daily special.The GravyI've had farmers gravy and onion gravy. I preferred the farmers gravy.OthersI got mushy peas (which they pronounced as mashy peas here) bc i had heard about this dish being something very british, and i liked it! It's basically green peas cooked till tender. We also had the cabbage which was sliced cabbage cooked dry. Was just ok.	came here twice for a no fuss english meal  i had bangers and mash both times the mashi really enjoyed the cheesy mustard mash  with wholegrain mustard  horse radish one is pretty good too the bangersi had lamb and mint  pork leek  duck cognac and spicy pork  all of them were good  i enjoyed the duck cognac the most but it was a daily special the gravyi ve had farmers gravy and onion gravy  i preferred the farmers gravy othersi got mushy peas  which they pronounced as mashy peas here  bc i had heard about this dish being something very british  and i liked it  it s basically green peas cooked till tender  we also had the cabbage which was sliced cabbage cooked dry  was just ok

Before going on exploring on foot, I've decided to get some help from Yelp, after many considerations I've decided on Mother Mash (the name says it all). They have variations of mash and gravy to go with. You can choose either sausages or pies. Their mash is still the highlight to the dish. Worth visiting.	london is famous for their mash and pies  but which one is actually good  before going on exploring on foot  i ve decided to get some help from yelp  after many considerations i ve decided on mother mash  the name says it all   they have variations of mash and gravy to go with  you can choose either sausages or pies  their mash is still the highlight to the dish  worth visiting

1654	4.0	My first ever bangers and mash experience did not disappoint! My boyfriend and I came here right before closing and had the place to ourselves. There are only a few tables in the restaurant so I imagine it can get very busy. We got some recommendations from the owner (who happily chatted with us throughout the night) and ordered a few different sausages with mash. I was very happy with what I ordered and was practically licking my plate at the end of the meal. Wish I could have taken a to-go box back to the US!	my first ever bangers and mash experience did not disappoint  my boyfriend and i came here right before closing and had the place to ourselves  there are only a few tables in the restaurant so i imagine it can get very busy  we got some recommendations from the owner  who happily chatted with us throughout the night  and ordered a few different sausages with mash  i was very happy with what i ordered and was practically licking my plate at the end of the meal  wish i could have taken a to go box back to the us 
1655	4.0	I really wanted a meat pie on this trip to London so I searched and decided to try Mother Mash. Tucked away off a quaint street one street parallel to the busy and bustling Oxford street, I was really excited to try this place.My friend and I walked in for a late lunch, and were seated immediately. It wasn't too busy but the space itself is quite small but not cramped at all. I really loved the way the menu works - it gives a variety of options where you can choose one item each from each of three columns: Mash, Bangers or Meat Pie, and Gravy.I chose Cramp Mash (Irish mash with milk, butter, cheddar cheese, and spring onions), Steak and Ale Pie (the special of the day), and Farmer's Gravy (red wine, onion, smoked bacon, and mushrooms).My friend got the Cheesy Mustard Mash (mash with mature cheddar and whole grain mustard), Cumberland sausage, and Farmer's Gravy.The highlight for this meal was definitely the potatoes. Both our mashes were so delicious but I think we both would agree that the Cheesy Mustard Mash was our favorite because of the sharp flavor and texture the whole grain mustard added to the dish. It tasted like our favorite German potato salad and the sharpness of the mustard and the cheddar made the dish actually feel lighter, which made it easier to continue eating.The meat pie and sausages were good but the mashes were for sure the stars. The gravy as well was delicious and complimented everything well. It made a great sauce for the side vegetables we ordered.We also had the sticky toffee pudding with custard and really enjoyed the gooey warm dessert. I would say that it was on the sweeter end and for this type of dessert, I think if I were to order it again, I would have opted instead to eat the pudding with ice cream to cut the sweetness a bit as the custard didn't do that as much.	i really wanted a meat pie on this trip to london so i searched and decided to try mother mash  tucked away off a quaint street one street parallel to the busy and bustling oxford street  i was really excited to try this place my friend and i walked in for a late lunch  and were seated immediately  it wasn t too busy but the space itself is quite small but not cramped at all  i really loved the way the menu works   it gives a variety of options where you can choose one item each from each of three columns  mash  bangers or meat pie  and gravy i chose cramp mash  irish mash with milk  butter  cheddar cheese  and spring onions   steak and ale pie  the special of the day   and farmer s gravy  red wine  onion  smoked bacon  and mushrooms  my friend got the cheesy mustard mash  mash with mature cheddar and whole grain mustard   cumberland sausage  and farmer s gravy the highlight for this meal was definitely the potatoes  both our mashes were so delicious but i think we both would agree that the cheesy mustard mash was our favorite because of the sharp flavor and texture the whole grain mustard added to the dish  it tasted like our favorite german potato salad and the sharpness of the mustard and the cheddar made the dish actually feel lighter  which made it easier to continue eating the meat pie and sausages were good but the mashes were for sure the stars  the gravy as well was delicious and complimented everything well  it made a great sauce for the side vegetables we ordered we also had the sticky toffee pudding with custard and really enjoyed the gooey warm dessert  i would say that it was on the sweeter end and for this type of dessert  i think if i were to order it again  i would have opted instead to eat the pudding with ice cream to cut the sweetness a bit as the custard didn t do that as much

The waitress refused to serve them any drinks and then told us we had to leave because people were waiting, when we had a reservation and most of the group was already here.

It was NFL weekend in London and everything around Regent Street was ridiculously busy. We stumbled upon this place near closing time (30 mins 'til to be exact), we did not expect to be seated but to our delight and surprise we were! There were 2 servers who seemed extremely busy, running around this small shop constantly. Still, we were seated, order taken, water glasses filled, without delay.The menu is simple, pick your pie or pick a sausage and a mash. I had the steak and ale pie, my boyfriend had bangers and mash. I also got a heaping side of caramelized onions (my favorite thing ever) SO SO GOOD. Great flavor, the gravy on the mash was amazing. Price was pretty good too. Definitely recommend to get a nice British meal.	i was in london for a spontaneous long weekend trip with my boyfriend  we were staying in shoreditch but came to soho for a night out  it was nfl weekend in london and everything around regent street was ridiculously busy  we stumbled upon this place near closing time  30 mins  til to be exact   we did not expect to be seated but to our delight and surprise we were  there were 2 servers who seemed extremely busy  running around this small shop constantly  still  we were seated  order taken  water glasses filled  without delay the menu is simple  pick your pie or pick a sausage and a mash  i had the steak and ale pie  my boyfriend had bangers and mash  i also got a heaping side of caramelized onions  my favorite thing ever  so so good  great flavor  the gravy on the mash was amazing  price was pretty good too  definitely recommend to get a nice british meal 
1659	5.0	I've had bangers and mash in the states, and always wondered how much they actually resemble the real deal in London, well I found out. Of course both the British and American versions have mashed potatoes, sausages and gravy, but that's were the similarities end. The flavor of true bangers and mash can't be had in the State at least not that I have found. Mother Mash is my new home away from home.Picture it. Eight different types of mash, from horseradish, cheesy mustard and of course the classic with milk and butter. Then there are nine different types of bangers you can select from. (Yes this is build your own) from Cumberland sausages, Lincolnshire to lamb and mint, and yes for you vegetarians out there they have a vegetable and herb banger! And it doesn't stop there. Once you select your mash and bangers then you get to choose your gravy, from traditional to veggie and everywhere in between.I selected the horseradish mash with Cumberland sausages and tradition gravy. From the first bite until the very last I was in doggy heaven. Word cannot describe the flavors and textures of this dish. The potatoes are whipped to a fluffy consistency mixed with a fresh horseradish sauce and bits of the horseradish root. The sausages are mild, and tangy and blend perfectly with the traditional gravy. If it hadn't been for a full house, I literally would have licked my plate clean, that's how insanely good this dish was.I don't know how other restaurants prepare their bangers and mash, but at Mother Mash's that all they do, and they have perfected the art, and yes I now know that true bangers and mash is an art form.With love from my dog bowl to yours...Shata	i ve had bangers and mash in the states  and always wondered how much they actually resemble the real deal in london  well i found out  of course both the british and american versions have mashed potatoes  sausages and gravy  but that s were the similarities end  the flavor of true bangers and mash can t be had in the state at least not that i have found  mother mash is my new home away from home picture it  eight different types of mash  from horseradish  cheesy mustard and of course the classic with milk and butter  then there are nine different types of bangers you can select from   yes this is build your own  from cumberland sausages  lincolnshire to lamb and mint  and yes for you vegetarians out there they have a vegetable and herb banger  and it doesn t stop there  once you select your mash and bangers then you get to choose your gravy  from traditional to veggie and everywhere in between i selected the horseradish mash with cumberland sausages and tradition gravy  from the first bite until the very last i was in doggy heaven  word cannot describe the flavors and textures of this dish  the potatoes are whipped to a fluffy consistency mixed with a fresh horseradish sauce and bits of the horseradish root  the sausages are mild  and tangy and blend perfectly with the traditional gravy  if it hadn t been for a full house  i literally would have licked my plate clean  that s how insanely good this dish was i don t know how other restaurants prepare their bangers and mash  but at mother mash s that all they do  and they have perfected the art  and yes i now know that true bangers and mash is an art form with love from my dog bowl to yours   shata

I got the Irish mash with cheddar and onions, the chicken and leek pie and the traditional sauce.  It was heavy, so I wish I had tried another sauce and got some sausage instead of the filled pie, but it was still good!  I got to try the farmer's gravy from my husband's plate, and boy did that have flavor!  His mash was outstanding too. (It was the fried option).Very small shop, very busy, sometimes crowded. In fact, you may be seated elbow to elbow, but as long as you don't make eye contact, then nobody's really there. ;)	cute little shop in soho   so many options nearby but if you re looking for some traditional english fare with options  then try it out  i got the irish mash with cheddar and onions  the chicken and leek pie and the traditional sauce   it was heavy  so i wish i had tried another sauce and got some sausage instead of the filled pie  but it was still good   i got to try the farmer s gravy from my husband s plate  and boy did that have flavor   his mash was outstanding too   it was the fried option  very small shop  very busy  sometimes crowded  in fact  you may be seated elbow to elbow  but as long as you don t make eye contact  then nobody s really there

But it is certainly worth the wait in my opinion.Definitely a must try if you're in central!	this place makes a damn great banger and mash if you ask me i came back to this place after my sister found it on yelp   my american friend was in town and i took him here to try it i ordered the lamb and mint sausages on a bed of mustard mash and it was very good   the sausages had great flavour and texture and as did the mashed potatoes   this place is very small and fills up really quick during the busy period  but it is certainly worth the wait in my opinion definitely a must try if you re in central

I ordered Champ, Pork & Chili, Lamb & Mint, and traditional gravy. They even have choices of mashed or bashed (more texture), which I thought was great for those who might not enjoy the texture of baby food.Outstanding! Prices were reasonable for the experience.

I expected more of the other ingredients in the mashed potatoes, but they were still quite good. The sausage was tasty but I wouldn't rave about it. The gravy didn't taste that different from any other gravy I'd had in the past. The combination of the foods was really satisfying though! We went for a late lunch at 3:30 so the service was super fast too.	mother mash is a great stop for anyone touring london and looking for some comfort food  i had the champ mashed potatoes with the london smokey sausages and veggie gravy  i expected more of the other ingredients in the mashed potatoes  but they were still quite good  the sausage was tasty but i wouldn t rave about it  the gravy didn t taste that different from any other gravy i d had in the past  the combination of the foods was really satisfying though  we went for a late lunch at 3 30 so the service was super fast too

We were greeted by more employees who got us ketchup and mayonnaise. Once our pagers started to buzz we went and got our food.The fries were spot on. They tasted just like the US ones. The burger was pretty damn good but the beef and bun tasted just a littttle bit different. The bun wasn't as greasy or buttery and the meat wasn't as soft. Other than that, I was more than satisfied. It was my first burger in London and I wouldn't have it any other way.	came here on a wednesday and didn t have to wait on line at all i love shake shack in the us so i was ecstatic to see one here in london  we walked directly up to the counter and ordered our shack burgers  we got our pagers and went out to the eating area outside the restaurant  we were greeted by more employees who got us ketchup and mayonnaise  once our pagers started to buzz we went and got our food the fries were spot on  they tasted just like the us ones  the burger was pretty damn good but the beef and bun tasted just a littttle bit different  the bun wasn t as greasy or buttery and the meat wasn t as soft  other than that  i was more than satisfied  it was my first burger in london and i wouldn t have it any other way

They were very welcoming when taking our order. My husband had the hamburger and I had the fried chick'n shack and fries. It was tasty and the fried chicken was perfect. My husband liked the hamburger and the fries were nicely crisped. It was good and way better than your average fast food (McDonalds, Burger King, etc.) I think my husband still prefers In-n-Out. I liked that they have other choices, rather than just beef. I would definitely eat at Shake Shack again, If only they had one in the San Francisco Bay Area.	had a late lunch at shake shack covent garden  we beat the crowds and the long line we saw around noon  the service was friendly and efficient  they were very welcoming when taking our order  my husband had the hamburger and i had the fried chick n shack and fries  it was tasty and the fried chicken was perfect  my husband liked the hamburger and the fries were nicely crisped  it was good and way better than your average fast food  mcdonalds  burger king  etc   i think my husband still prefers in n out  i liked that they have other choices  rather than just beef  i would definitely eat at shake shack again  if only they had one in the san francisco bay area

1689	3.0	Between Shake Shack and Five Guys, Shake Shack was actually the first to arrive across the pond from America.  Unlike traditional fast food burgers which rely on cheap frozen supplies from its headquarters, Shake Shack only serves freshly cooked meat.  There is no freezer on the premises which ensures they only serves fresh meat and ingredients.  This concept is actually common among Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out Burger.  I have tried Shake Shack and Five Guys in London and I have to say that burgers in Five Guys do perform slightly better than Shake Shack.  Although I do not see much difference in the meat quality as both of them are equally as fresh, I think that the meat in Five Guys are seasoned slightly better compared to Shake Shack.  However, Shake Shack's bun is lighter and softer.  I was lucky enough to have Shake Shack in New York and again when compared to the original burgers from the East Coast, the Americans do them better.  That is why the queue there is never ending whereas the one in London is almost non-existence.  When I was in the states, I have also tried their famous milkshakes.  I love the peanut butter milkshakes when I was in New York.  Initially, when the Covent Garden branch opened, their peanut butter milkshakes were really good.  However, over the years, the quality has gone downhill.  They were either less peanut butter or they were too thick that it was hard to suck it from the straw.  Shake Shack is also extremely slow in expanding.  To date when I checked, there are only 4 Shake Shack around the country and mainly centered in London and 1 in Wales.  Five Guys have 50 branches across the country.  Perhaps their burger is not as good as their rivals and they are still trying to perfect them but surely it should no take that long.  They were the first to step into this country and now their rivals have surpassed them in expanding their business.     They need to revisit their milkshakes and burger.  Whatever they are doing here, clearly the Americans who came here to train there did not train them well enough.  There is such a mass difference in taste.  They need to get back to how good the burger and shakes were initially when they started out in the states.  Probably that is why they were never able to expand as quick as Five Guys.  Do it now before you lose more customers!	between shake shack and five guys  shake shack was actually the first to arrive across the pond from america   unlike traditional fast food burgers which rely on cheap frozen supplies from its headquarters  shake shack only serves freshly cooked meat   there is no freezer on the premises which ensures they only serves fresh meat and ingredients   this concept is actually common among shake shack  five guys and in n out burger   i have tried shake shack and five guys in london and i have to say that burgers in five guys do perform slightly better than shake shack   although i do not see much difference in the meat quality as both of them are equally as fresh  i think that the meat in five guys are seasoned slightly better compared to shake shack   however  shake shack s bun is lighter and softer   i was lucky enough to have shake shack in new york and again when compared to the original burgers from the east coast  the americans do them better   that is why the queue there is never ending whereas the one in london is almost non existence   when i was in the states  i have also tried their famous milkshakes   i love the peanut butter milkshakes when i was in new york   initially  when the covent garden branch opened  their peanut butter milkshakes were really good   however  over the years  the quality has gone downhill   they were either less peanut butter or they were too thick that it was hard to suck it from the straw   shake shack is also extremely slow in expanding   to date when i checked  there are only 4 shake shack around the country and mainly centered in london and 1 in wales   five guys have 50 branches across the country   perhaps their burger is not as good as their rivals and they are still trying to perfect them but surely it should no take that long   they were the first to step into this country and now their rivals have surpassed them in expanding their business      they need to revisit their milkshakes and burger   whatever they are doing here  clearly the americans who came here to train there did not train them well enough   there is such a mass difference in taste   they need to get back to how good the burger and shakes were initially when they started out in the states   probably that is why they were never able to expand as quick as five guys   do it now before you lose more customers 
1690	5.0	Shake Shack is legit. It's burgers are above Five Guys, and possibly above the beloved In & Out. I realize that I just upset the majority of you, but the burger here is solid. The beef is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The bun is toasted and does its job of holding everything together. No excess sauces get in the way of this burger. I ordered the burger with fried onions in their ale sauce. Sounds a bit strange, but I liked the toppings over the plain burger that my buddy ordered. The fries are not quite at Five Guys level. They were cooked crunchy and crisp with the right amount of seasoning, but didn't have the meatiness of the perfect Five Guys fry. Overall, this place would be a go to place if there were one in SJ. When you get the opportunity to frequent one of their locations go for it! You've heard about them so go try it for yourself and see if it holds up to your favorite burger.	shake shack is legit  it s burgers are above five guys  and possibly above the beloved in   out  i realize that i just upset the majority of you  but the burger here is solid  the beef is perfectly cooked and seasoned  the bun is toasted and does its job of holding everything together  no excess sauces get in the way of this burger  i ordered the burger with fried onions in their ale sauce  sounds a bit strange  but i liked the toppings over the plain burger that my buddy ordered  the fries are not quite at five guys level  they were cooked crunchy and crisp with the right amount of seasoning  but didn t have the meatiness of the perfect five guys fry  overall  this place would be a go to place if there were one in sj  when you get the opportunity to frequent one of their locations go for it  you ve heard about them so go try it for yourself and see if it holds up to your favorite burger

When shake shack opened up in london, the nostalgic part of me wanted to give it a visit, but the long lines in covent garden was daunting. Finally there came a day on a wet october afternoon at around 3pm when the line was palatable, hopefully like their burger that i remembered.My bf opted for the smokeshack and their shack beer, but their shackbeer was out and he had to go for the meantime. I got their regular cheeseburger with salted apple frozen custard. It was around 8 quid for a burger and the burgers are tiny. Although delicious, I walked away feeling really unsatisfied. Also their pickles are not the same as the ones in NYC - way too sharp. The frozen custard was pretty much flavourless.Definitely not my go-to place for burgers in London. Wouldn't come back unless i become a gazillionaire.	it s been years since i ve been to a shake shack   at least 5 years if not longer  when shake shack opened up in london  the nostalgic part of me wanted to give it a visit  but the long lines in covent garden was daunting  finally there came a day on a wet october afternoon at around 3pm when the line was palatable  hopefully like their burger that i remembered my bf opted for the smokeshack and their shack beer  but their shackbeer was out and he had to go for the meantime  i got their regular cheeseburger with salted apple frozen custard  it was around 8 quid for a burger and the burgers are tiny  although delicious  i walked away feeling really unsatisfied  also their pickles are not the same as the ones in nyc   way too sharp  the frozen custard was pretty much flavourless definitely not my go to place for burgers in london  wouldn t come back unless i become a gazillionaire

1694	3.0	I first saw Shake Shack on an instagram feed. I was drawn to her immediately. There was something about her demeanor that made her so irresistible. She was seductive, and she knew it. Maybe it's the way she dresses. A sliver of her buns shows through the burger wrapping, and I could almost felt how fluffy it is with my eyes. Her tomatoes has a healthy blush, giving her a pretty face too. And oh lord, the meat. The sauce glistens on her skin, and several drops slowly trickles down. She blankets her goodies with a slice of melting cheese, revealing just enough to induce me even further. Though I was only looking through photos, I noticed that I was salivating with my tongue slightly out, ready to taste her for myself. I finally agreed to meet her at Covent Garden in London. Under one of the most serene locations, I would be able to enjoy Shake Shack while admiring the architecture around us. It did not bother me that Shake Shack has been around a few times. I've seen her pictures of passion with @instafoodforreal, @bestburgers_london, and @therealJackinTheBox, and if anything, it just made me want her more. I was more bothered about how my main squeeze would feel, but I convinced myself that In-N-Out would not mind me indulging in a side chick from time to time.Shake shack and I found a seat under the roofs of the garden. First thing that I noticed was that she was high maintenance. Taking her out with her entourage of a Milkshake and a side of Cheese Fries costed close to 15 pounds. And that's only for one slice of patty. I would have had to shell out if I wanted her to show both slices. Oh, but Shake Shack was delicious. Her proportions are perfect. She was not voluptuous, nor does she try to be. She was a casual sexy, but with a touch of class. She kept it at a perfect medium rare, and made sure that you didn't forget her buns complemented the whole experience. As a kicker, she would invite the milkshake to help you wash down the whole experience. Even when I was finished, I was left wanting more.But the reality was that Shake Shack was expensive. At a cost of 15 pounds, it was unrealistic for me to commit to a relationship. I packed my bags and headed home to my true love. Though I have my share of burger escapades, In N Out will always be my true love.	i first saw shake shack on an instagram feed  i was drawn to her immediately  there was something about her demeanor that made her so irresistible  she was seductive  and she knew it  maybe it s the way she dresses  a sliver of her buns shows through the burger wrapping  and i could almost felt how fluffy it is with my eyes  her tomatoes has a healthy blush  giving her a pretty face too  and oh lord  the meat  the sauce glistens on her skin  and several drops slowly trickles down  she blankets her goodies with a slice of melting cheese  revealing just enough to induce me even further  though i was only looking through photos  i noticed that i was salivating with my tongue slightly out  ready to taste her for myself  i finally agreed to meet her at covent garden in london  under one of the most serene locations  i would be able to enjoy shake shack while admiring the architecture around us  it did not bother me that shake shack has been around a few times  i ve seen her pictures of passion with  instafoodforreal   bestburgers_london  and  therealjackinthebox  and if anything  it just made me want her more  i was more bothered about how my main squeeze would feel  but i convinced myself that in n out would not mind me indulging in a side chick from time to time shake shack and i found a seat under the roofs of the garden  first thing that i noticed was that she was high maintenance  taking her out with her entourage of a milkshake and a side of cheese fries costed close to 15 pounds  and that s only for one slice of patty  i would have had to shell out if i wanted her to show both slices  oh  but shake shack was delicious  her proportions are perfect  she was not voluptuous  nor does she try to be  she was a casual sexy  but with a touch of class  she kept it at a perfect medium rare  and made sure that you didn t forget her buns complemented the whole experience  as a kicker  she would invite the milkshake to help you wash down the whole experience  even when i was finished  i was left wanting more but the reality was that shake shack was expensive  at a cost of 15 pounds  it was unrealistic for me to commit to a relationship  i packed my bags and headed home to my true love  though i have my share of burger escapades  in n out will always be my true love 
1695	3.0	We were in the area for a Yelp-related event and looked for a place to have lunch after. I was surprised to learn this New York establishment opened locations in England..before the West Coast. No bother, though. We were excited to have a bite of our favorite East Coast burgers.Despite the masses of people, the location seemed a bit inconspicuous and it was hard to tell were the queues started and ended from the way it is set up. Nearly all Shake Shacks I've been to (stateside at least) always have crowds; this one is no different. That of course is to be expected for a place as busy as Covent Garden. It's so busy, though, that there is even a separate queue for the designated seating areas. Go with someone, so one of you can stand in the food queue and the other can wait for a proper seat inside. Otherwise, you may be stuck on the outer edges having to fight off pigeons scavenging the adjacent leftover trays as we did! Once the food was finally ready and we dug in, I realized that this was not the same food I'd salivated over before. My burger patty was slightly dry, definitely not the level of juicy goodness familiar to many Shack Stack lovers. I didn't think I would have to give any Shake Shack less than four stars (since my first visit in Vegas), but a few things could have been improved. 3.5 on the food and experience.	we were in the area for a yelp related event and looked for a place to have lunch after  i was surprised to learn this new york establishment opened locations in england  before the west coast  no bother  though  we were excited to have a bite of our favorite east coast burgers despite the masses of people  the location seemed a bit inconspicuous and it was hard to tell were the queues started and ended from the way it is set up  nearly all shake shacks i ve been to  stateside at least  always have crowds  this one is no different  that of course is to be expected for a place as busy as covent garden  it s so busy  though  that there is even a separate queue for the designated seating areas  go with someone  so one of you can stand in the food queue and the other can wait for a proper seat inside  otherwise  you may be stuck on the outer edges having to fight off pigeons scavenging the adjacent leftover trays as we did  once the food was finally ready and we dug in  i realized that this was not the same food i d salivated over before  my burger patty was slightly dry  definitely not the level of juicy goodness familiar to many shack stack lovers  i didn t think i would have to give any shake shack less than four stars  since my first visit in vegas   but a few things could have been improved  3 5 on the food and experience 
1696	4.0	My first experience with Shake Shack was in Boston, so when I heard they had opened in London I just had to eat there when I was visiting London. They have a very good arrangement with ordering and then you will get a beeper thing that will flash and vibrate when your order is ready. I ordered the Shroom burger which is THE BOMB, its: crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. And of course I had to add cheese fries and top it up with a beer. My sister ordered the Smoke Shack: Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce. We don't recommend this one; it was a so so burger. The staff here is very helpful and they carried our order from the counter to our table outside when we handed in our beeper thing. I would definitely recommend this place for burger lovers.	my first experience with shake shack was in boston  so when i heard they had opened in london i just had to eat there when i was visiting london  they have a very good arrangement with ordering and then you will get a beeper thing that will flash and vibrate when your order is ready  i ordered the shroom burger which is the bomb  its  crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses  topped with lettuce  tomato  shacksauce  and of course i had to add cheese fries and top it up with a beer  my sister ordered the smoke shack  cheeseburger topped with all natural applewood smoked bacon  chopped cherry pepper  shacksauce  we don t recommend this one  it was a so so burger  the staff here is very helpful and they carried our order from the counter to our table outside when we handed in our beeper thing  i would definitely recommend this place for burger lovers 
1697	5.0	I'm obsessed with Shake Shack. Their burgers are the best in the fast food game, and easily in a category above McDonald's. Yes, it costs more but of course it's worth it!The food is excellent. There's not much more to say. It does take a little while, but they make it to order. I highly recommend cheese fries, they're so addictive! Most of the seating is outside, but under a roof so it doesn't get too cold in the winter. There are a few seats inside, but the inside feels very cramped and I would rather eat outside with my coat in the winter then sit inside.	i m obsessed with shake shack  their burgers are the best in the fast food game  and easily in a category above mcdonald s  yes  it costs more but of course it s worth it the food is excellent  there s not much more to say  it does take a little while  but they make it to order  i highly recommend cheese fries  they re so addictive  most of the seating is outside  but under a roof so it doesn t get too cold in the winter  there are a few seats inside  but the inside feels very cramped and i would rather eat outside with my coat in the winter then sit inside

1699	5.0	I've never been to a shake shack before and this was on my London hitlist! We were lucky the weather was in our favour and we sat outside watching everyone wander by in Covent Garden. We even got to overhear a little walking tour! So is definitely suggest sitting outside of weather permits. We ate pretty early, and by 12pm it was getting pretty busy and a queue was forming. I went for the shackmeister which included shack sauce and ale marinated shallots with crinkle fries and a lemonade. It was dynamite! I tried the cheese fries but I wasn't a fan. The burger was really tasty and fresh, the chips were awesome and I'd definitely go back!	i ve never been to a shake shack before and this was on my london hitlist  we were lucky the weather was in our favour and we sat outside watching everyone wander by in covent garden  we even got to overhear a little walking tour  so is definitely suggest sitting outside of weather permits  we ate pretty early  and by 12pm it was getting pretty busy and a queue was forming  i went for the shackmeister which included shack sauce and ale marinated shallots with crinkle fries and a lemonade  it was dynamite  i tried the cheese fries but i wasn t a fan  the burger was really tasty and fresh  the chips were awesome and i d definitely go back 
1700	3.0	This was the first Shake Shack I've ever been to. As a California girl, I will always have a special place in my heart for In n Out. Unfortunately, Shake Shack's burgers are not worth the wait, nor the hype. My vegetarian friend did like their veggie burger though. However, their shakes are amazing! They are frozen custard style so they're extra thick and creamy. I love their rotating flavors. I've tried the vanilla, black & white, and the mint chocolate at the London location. It's really expensive for something American, so I would save my money for something unique to London.	this was the first shake shack i ve ever been to  as a california girl  i will always have a special place in my heart for in n out  unfortunately  shake shack s burgers are not worth the wait  nor the hype  my vegetarian friend did like their veggie burger though  however  their shakes are amazing  they are frozen custard style so they re extra thick and creamy  i love their rotating flavors  i ve tried the vanilla  black   white  and the mint chocolate at the london location  it s really expensive for something american  so i would save my money for something unique to london 
1701	3.0	Shake Shack UK is tucked in a nice spot under the covered patio of Covent Garden and the staff were wonderful and attentive! However, being used to In N Out here in California, I really wasn't impressed with the food after hearing all the hype about New York's Shake Shack. My husband had the ShackMeister, a cheeseburger made with crispy ale-marinated shallots, and the cheese fries. I had the Chick'n Shack, made with crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo. We also ordered the ShackMeister ale, which was a nice surprise since In N Out does not serve alcohol. Maybe I had hyped it up too much, but I didn't love the food at all. My bun was gooey and not fresh like In N Out, and the fries were meh, as was the cheese sauce. Nothing had that fresh taste like In N Out. I really wanted to like this place but it was the blandest meal during our trip to London. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm sorry... :/	shake shack uk is tucked in a nice spot under the covered patio of covent garden and the staff were wonderful and attentive  however  being used to in n out here in california  i really wasn t impressed with the food after hearing all the hype about new york s shake shack  my husband had the shackmeister  a cheeseburger made with crispy ale marinated shallots  and the cheese fries  i had the chick n shack  made with crispy chicken breast with lettuce  pickles and buttermilk herb mayo  we also ordered the shackmeister ale  which was a nice surprise since in n out does not serve alcohol  maybe i had hyped it up too much  but i didn t love the food at all  my bun was gooey and not fresh like in n out  and the fries were meh  as was the cheese sauce  nothing had that fresh taste like in n out  i really wanted to like this place but it was the blandest meal during our trip to london  maybe my expectations were too high  i m sorry      
1702	5.0	This was our first time at the Snack Shack, I remember seeing one in Battery Park in New York. The queue was massive there, but didn't look to long yesterday in Covent Garden, so we gave it ago. It was about 10 mins in the queue and another 15 mins for the food, but it was really good. My daughter had the plain cheeseburger  and couldn't finish it. I had the pickled double burger with fries and it was really good. Limited seating, so find a seat first and send one of the group to order. They give you a pager so you know when your order is ready. Just to be up front, it's pricey, but its central London.	this was our first time at the snack shack  i remember seeing one in battery park in new york  the queue was massive there  but didn t look to long yesterday in covent garden  so we gave it ago  it was about 10 mins in the queue and another 15 mins for the food  but it was really good  my daughter had the plain cheeseburger  and couldn t finish it  i had the pickled double burger with fries and it was really good  limited seating  so find a seat first and send one of the group to order  they give you a pager so you know when your order is ready  just to be up front  it s pricey  but its central london

I think part of my problem was that for the past 24 hours, I had been told multiple times, by multiple people that it was ""the best!""... so when it was just kinda good, it felt a little disappointing.Don't get me wrong, it's a good burger, but the best, it is not. I took down the burger with beef, cheese and the fried portobello mushroom. The burger was nice, and the cheese was plenty but the mushroom didn't do it for me. I usually adore portobello mushroom, and though it was an interesting edition, it didn't seem to fit with the cheddar/beef combo. It wasn't anything particularly special.However, they have root beer floats, so they must be awesome and I will likely try them again. I think i'd stick to a classic cheese/bacon combo next time around.The one HUGE tip of the hat? These folks know how to work through a crowd efficiently!

1704	3.0	Since I never make it to shake shack while NYC, I figured I should try it while I was here (and hungry).In-n-out vs. Shake Shack...I can't believe this is even a question!After trying it I can confirm that in-n-out is 1000x better.  Don't get me wrong,  it's not a bad burger but it doesn't even compare to in-n-out. It's borderline insulting to compare the two.It's better compared to your local, mom & pop burger joint.	since i never make it to shake shack while nyc  i figured i should try it while i was here  and hungry  in n out vs  shake shack   i can t believe this is even a question after trying it i can confirm that in n out is 1000x better   don t get me wrong   it s not a bad burger but it doesn t even compare to in n out  it s borderline insulting to compare the two it s better compared to your local  mom   pop burger joint

1706	3.0	Can a burger ever be a bad thing? I'm not sure it can be to be honest! For an after work treat myself and a few colleges decided we would visit Shake Shack in Covent Garden. The first thing you notice about this place is that it is packed! When we arrived the queue was out the door but did seem to be going down quite quickly, we checked out the menu while queueing up and waited our turn to be served. After a five minute wait we were at the front and ready to place our order, I went for the smoke shack which was a smoked bacon burger with some fries. Both the burger and fries were excellent, fresh bread, crispy fries and great tasting patty, The only thing that let this place down for me was the small inside eating area. We needed to sit outside as it was so busy....after a day working outdoors a warm place to eat would have been pretty amazing. Overall this was a great burger experience but given how crazy busy this place is I think they need some outdoor heaters or a larger indoor space for people to eat. If you are looking for a takeaway burger fix this would be a perfect option!	can a burger ever be a bad thing  i m not sure it can be to be honest  for an after work treat myself and a few colleges decided we would visit shake shack in covent garden  the first thing you notice about this place is that it is packed  when we arrived the queue was out the door but did seem to be going down quite quickly  we checked out the menu while queueing up and waited our turn to be served  after a five minute wait we were at the front and ready to place our order  i went for the smoke shack which was a smoked bacon burger with some fries  both the burger and fries were excellent  fresh bread  crispy fries and great tasting patty  the only thing that let this place down for me was the small inside eating area  we needed to sit outside as it was so busy    after a day working outdoors a warm place to eat would have been pretty amazing  overall this was a great burger experience but given how crazy busy this place is i think they need some outdoor heaters or a larger indoor space for people to eat  if you are looking for a takeaway burger fix this would be a perfect option 
1707	4.0	Yes, it was easier to get to this Shake Shack than any in the US for me at this time.  I just watched the video about the 7 hour wait in NY and know how much my mom loves a good burger, so when we found this in Covent Garden it was a go.  The line was short.  My mom loves frozen custard too but we were not able to get any because we were full!I ordered a plain hamburger with lettuce, tomato and onion.  My mom got a cheeseburger and fries.  We both ordered ICED TEA with EXTRA ICE and we were sooooo happy to see iced tea on the menu.  We both did not get the shack sauce.The flavor was delicious and it was worth the stop.  I will eat here again when I come across one in the US, but in this case, I got Scottish beef so that makes it extra cool!	yes  it was easier to get to this shake shack than any in the us for me at this time   i just watched the video about the 7 hour wait in ny and know how much my mom loves a good burger  so when we found this in covent garden it was a go   the line was short   my mom loves frozen custard too but we were not able to get any because we were full i ordered a plain hamburger with lettuce  tomato and onion   my mom got a cheeseburger and fries   we both ordered iced tea with extra ice and we were sooooo happy to see iced tea on the menu   we both did not get the shack sauce the flavor was delicious and it was worth the stop   i will eat here again when i come across one in the us  but in this case  i got scottish beef so that makes it extra cool 
1708	3.0	I loved Shake Shack having tried it in the U.S., but I've gotta say, the U.K. branch just isn't doing it for me! The seating situation is awful, with three separate areas belonging to Shake Shack dotted around Covent Garden that are not immediately obvious or easy to identify. There have staff sort of managing these areas. I say sort of as they aren't exactly there to greet/seat you, they just seem to floating around, clearing trays form tables, telling the odd group of people where to sit. The way this restaurant works is you queue up, you order and pay, and are given a little remote buzzer that you take with you. When your order is ready, your buzzer will flash and you need to return to the collection point to collect your food, and bring it to your table (if you have been lucky enough to secure one!)Last time I was here all of the tables were full with people with people who hadn't even ordered yet and were still trying to figure out the whole process. As this area is full of tourists, most people are not automatically familiar with how the Shake Shack system works here, or where to go/what to do. It's really not an intuitive system and means that there is a lot of confusion about how to order/where you can sit/what to do. The food here is pretty good, but again not to the same standard as their American branches.  It's also about twice the price!	i loved shake shack having tried it in the u s   but i ve gotta say  the u k  branch just isn t doing it for me  the seating situation is awful  with three separate areas belonging to shake shack dotted around covent garden that are not immediately obvious or easy to identify  there have staff sort of managing these areas  i say sort of as they aren t exactly there to greet seat you  they just seem to floating around  clearing trays form tables  telling the odd group of people where to sit  the way this restaurant works is you queue up  you order and pay  and are given a little remote buzzer that you take with you  when your order is ready  your buzzer will flash and you need to return to the collection point to collect your food  and bring it to your table  if you have been lucky enough to secure one  last time i was here all of the tables were full with people with people who hadn t even ordered yet and were still trying to figure out the whole process  as this area is full of tourists  most people are not automatically familiar with how the shake shack system works here  or where to go what to do  it s really not an intuitive system and means that there is a lot of confusion about how to order where you can sit what to do  the food here is pretty good  but again not to the same standard as their american branches   it s also about twice the price

It was insanely busy but the queue moved quickly and I was so happy to see veggie burgers on the menu as both of us don't eat meat. The 'Shroom burger did not disappoint. It was just the right side of greasy and the fries were crispy and salty. Yum. Great milkshakes too. We were too full to try Concrete or Custards but maybe next time. They also do a vegetarian hot dog!	stumbled across this place last year when i was in london  i d heard a lot about it from friends who visited america and we were in a rush so we decided to give it a bash  it was insanely busy but the queue moved quickly and i was so happy to see veggie burgers on the menu as both of us don t eat meat  the  shroom burger did not disappoint  it was just the right side of greasy and the fries were crispy and salty  yum  great milkshakes too  we were too full to try concrete or custards but maybe next time  they also do a vegetarian hot dog 
1711	4.0	It was February when I went and it looked quite busy. Also stood at the wrong side of the place, but luckily there was a friendly guy there overlooking the seating area and explained how it worked.The entrance was on the outside of the building and there was a big queu which was not very nice as it was freezing (the reason why I was stood inside looking for the entrance). But I heard so many good things about it that I decided to wait.After a long wait I managed to put in my order: cheeseburger, cheese fries and lemonade. Because it was so cold my food already lost it's warmth by the time I sat down and it looked like someone drove over it in a big car. However, it tasted delicious. So I would advise you to go there in summer, when not in a rush, and just close your eyes when you start eating	it was february when i went and it looked quite busy  also stood at the wrong side of the place  but luckily there was a friendly guy there overlooking the seating area and explained how it worked the entrance was on the outside of the building and there was a big queu which was not very nice as it was freezing  the reason why i was stood inside looking for the entrance   but i heard so many good things about it that i decided to wait after a long wait i managed to put in my order  cheeseburger  cheese fries and lemonade  because it was so cold my food already lost it s warmth by the time i sat down and it looked like someone drove over it in a big car  however  it tasted delicious  so i would advise you to go there in summer  when not in a rush  and just close your eyes when you start eating

I'm informed that Shake Shack comes from across the Atlantic pond and what a brilliant trip it has made.I opted for the Shake Stack with extra bacon (no burger is complete without bacon in my eyes). The Shake Stack is a normal cheese burger topped with a 'shroom burger and it works brilliantly! The burger was medium rare - as a burger should be - and the 'shroom just made it have that additional juiciness which isn't easy to find at your standard burger joint. Also they do crinkled chips, yeah, crinklessss! Reminded me of when I was a kid and made me very happy! Another great meal in the Covent Garden area! Note: not a huge eating are so you could be outside but it's so worth it!	shake  shake  shake  shake  shake  shake    shake your    no not tonight thank you  no bootie shaking  but plenty of burger eating instead  woo wow  so impressed with this place  i m informed that shake shack comes from across the atlantic pond and what a brilliant trip it has made i opted for the shake stack with extra bacon  no burger is complete without bacon in my eyes   the shake stack is a normal cheese burger topped with a  shroom burger and it works brilliantly  the burger was medium rare   as a burger should be   and the  shroom just made it have that additional juiciness which isn t easy to find at your standard burger joint  also they do crinkled chips  yeah  crinklessss  reminded me of when i was a kid and made me very happy  another great meal in the covent garden area  note  not a huge eating are so you could be outside but it s so worth it 
1713	4.0	I love Shake Shack, I've been a fan since having my first in NYC about 5 years plus ago. However it's soo much cheaper in America than here. I was soo excited when one opened up in London. I wish there was one closer to me, like Five Guys which is expanding well in the U.K. I noticed that Shake Shack have opened another location in Leicester Sq -- why soo close?!? I love their burgers, especially the buns, however there expensive here considering their size. But I love their cheese fries and normally just pop in for the fries alone. I used to love their chocolate shakes but have recently gone off them, as my last few haven't been as thick and older ones, maybe they changed the recipe or something. Still love the place though. Lastly sometimes the location can be really busy, other times it's quiet.	i love shake shack  i ve been a fan since having my first in nyc about 5 years plus ago  however it s soo much cheaper in america than here  i was soo excited when one opened up in london  i wish there was one closer to me  like five guys which is expanding well in the u k  i noticed that shake shack have opened another location in leicester sq    why soo close    i love their burgers  especially the buns  however there expensive here considering their size  but i love their cheese fries and normally just pop in for the fries alone  i used to love their chocolate shakes but have recently gone off them  as my last few haven t been as thick and older ones  maybe they changed the recipe or something  still love the place though  lastly sometimes the location can be really busy  other times it s quiet 
1714	4.0	I'm not really sure why we ended up here on one of our first days in London from the US, but I haven't actually had Shake Shack before stateside either, so I guess this worked out. We got the SmokeShack burgers, which were like bacon cheeseburgers. The cool thing was that it came with English bacon which was a nice touch. The burgers were not as big as I thought they would be - they actually came out looking a little squished. However, they still tasted pretty good - the cheese was melted on very nicely and there was the right amount of sauce. We also got their fries, which were actually really good. I'm usually hesitant when I see crinkle cut fries as it reminds me of grade school cafeterias or freezer package fries, but these were actually very crispy and had a good amount of salt. They also had a blood orange lemonade, which was pretty sour but had a hint of blood orange flavor to it.There is a seating area in the middle of Covent Garden for Shake Shack customers. The workers did a good job of getting people seated, and cleaning up after people were done eating in order to gently nudge them along so that other people can sit down. We still waited in a queue for about 10 min, but we were seated before our food was ready, and a worker took our pager and went to pick up the food for us once we were seated - pretty nice service.	i m not really sure why we ended up here on one of our first days in london from the us  but i haven t actually had shake shack before stateside either  so i guess this worked out  we got the smokeshack burgers  which were like bacon cheeseburgers  the cool thing was that it came with english bacon which was a nice touch  the burgers were not as big as i thought they would be   they actually came out looking a little squished  however  they still tasted pretty good   the cheese was melted on very nicely and there was the right amount of sauce  we also got their fries  which were actually really good  i m usually hesitant when i see crinkle cut fries as it reminds me of grade school cafeterias or freezer package fries  but these were actually very crispy and had a good amount of salt  they also had a blood orange lemonade  which was pretty sour but had a hint of blood orange flavor to it there is a seating area in the middle of covent garden for shake shack customers  the workers did a good job of getting people seated  and cleaning up after people were done eating in order to gently nudge them along so that other people can sit down  we still waited in a queue for about 10 min  but we were seated before our food was ready  and a worker took our pager and went to pick up the food for us once we were seated   pretty nice service

Shame on me for coming here?A burger with bacon, fries, and bottled water cost US$19.  That's expensive.It's just like the Shake Shack in NYC, but without the line.  The food taste exactly the same, no different.You order your food, grab a buzzer, and take a seat.  There's (limited) indoor and (plentiful) outdoor seating, remember it's cold during the winter.  They bring your food, but you have to grab condiments yourself.	shake shack in london  shame on me for coming here a burger with bacon  fries  and bottled water cost us 19   that s expensive it s just like the shake shack in nyc  but without the line   the food taste exactly the same  no different you order your food  grab a buzzer  and take a seat   there s  limited  indoor and  plentiful  outdoor seating  remember it s cold during the winter   they bring your food  but you have to grab condiments yourself 
1716	4.0	Shake Shack... how long I have wanted to visit thee. I was even in New York but not fully compus mentis when I visited and got a hot dog instead. What was I thinking? Fast forward exactly (to the week) two years and I'm transported to Covent Garden in central London. Again not fully compus mentis but this time determined to get the burger I have coveted for several years.After being let-down by the Five Guys invasion of Glasgow (I went there three times on my US visit) in terms of both quality and especially price, perhaps as I have nothing to compare against Shake Shack UK was already at an advantage. However, from when I took my first bite of the Double Smoke Shack I knew I was in burger heaven. The bun held the greasy mess of cheese, prime beef patty and perfectly cooked bacon impeccably. There wasn't a great amount of sauce on the burger but the nearby ketchup and mustard dispenser (plus tabasco) let me sauce it right up. I didn't come across one piece of gristle which was very welcome.Even the crinkly fries which I thought didn't looked great (you can buy the same brand in Costco for around £3 for 2.5kg... the profit margin on these must be incredible) were actually super crispy and well smothered in tasty tasty cheese sauce.You do pay for the pleasure however, my bill was almost £15 just for one burger and one portion of fries. Will I be back? Most definitely.	shake shack    how long i have wanted to visit thee  i was even in new york but not fully compus mentis when i visited and got a hot dog instead  what was i thinking  fast forward exactly  to the week  two years and i m transported to covent garden in central london  again not fully compus mentis but this time determined to get the burger i have coveted for several years after being let down by the five guys invasion of glasgow  i went there three times on my us visit  in terms of both quality and especially price  perhaps as i have nothing to compare against shake shack uk was already at an advantage  however  from when i took my first bite of the double smoke shack i knew i was in burger heaven  the bun held the greasy mess of cheese  prime beef patty and perfectly cooked bacon impeccably  there wasn t a great amount of sauce on the burger but the nearby ketchup and mustard dispenser  plus tabasco  let me sauce it right up  i didn t come across one piece of gristle which was very welcome even the crinkly fries which i thought didn t looked great  you can buy the same brand in costco for around  3 for 2 5kg    the profit margin on these must be incredible  were actually super crispy and well smothered in tasty tasty cheese sauce you do pay for the pleasure however  my bill was almost  15 just for one burger and one portion of fries  will i be back  most definitely

Trust me, it'll be worth it""The girl in front of us: (turns around) ""YES, seriously, I've been to this chain in New York, and it is worth the wait!""The couple behind us in the line (heard the previous comment): ""It is really good, we tried it in New York too!"" (... then they all started chatting about New York)Now, that is a lot of hype for a burger from a chain I have never heard of, but that the rest of the queue seems to be loopy for! It became a little surreal after our 40 minute wait! Once I got to the front of the line, the server wanted to high five me! All the staff seem very enthusiastic and happy (I wonder if they will keep up this level of enthusiasm after the first day!?) Food:- I loved the Shack Stack! It has a huge juicy burger and a breaded mushroom. The bread was lovely (more bread-y than fall-apart brioche-y) They leave the roll attached at the back, so you don't end up covered in burger juice- nice. To be honest, I prefer burgers a little more on the rare side...but it was really tasty.  - I'm not sure why they call the ice-cream-like custard a ""concrete"" but whatever it is called, it was yummy and had huuuge chunks of cookies/chocolate. All in all, I'm a fan.

1718	3.0	I'm torn here, friends. Shake Shack holds a special place in my heart. Burgers with perfectly melted cheese and creamy sauce, served on Martin's potato rolls, are a straight-up taste of home. Exactly what the doctor ordered when I'm feeling a bit homesick for my country of birth. It's true, the food at Shake Shack is on the money and it's EXACTLY like eating at a location in the states...but that's sort of my problem with this place. It is too pricy for what it is--basic burger and fries (sorry, chips) fare--no matter how perfect the crinkle fries are with their creamy cheese sauce. There are far too many places in Covent Garden (let alone London) to get a stellar/unique burger for a lesser/comparable price (Meat Market, right across the road)That being said, I will surely return here with my tail between my legs, the next time I am feeling homesick and hungry and am in the neighborhood...i will just curse my bank statement afterwards.	i m torn here  friends  shake shack holds a special place in my heart  burgers with perfectly melted cheese and creamy sauce  served on martin s potato rolls  are a straight up taste of home  exactly what the doctor ordered when i m feeling a bit homesick for my country of birth  it s true  the food at shake shack is on the money and it s exactly like eating at a location in the states   but that s sort of my problem with this place  it is too pricy for what it is  basic burger and fries  sorry  chips  fare  no matter how perfect the crinkle fries are with their creamy cheese sauce  there are far too many places in covent garden  let alone london  to get a stellar unique burger for a lesser comparable price  meat market  right across the road that being said  i will surely return here with my tail between my legs  the next time i am feeling homesick and hungry and am in the neighborhood   i will just curse my bank statement afterwards

It is cheaper than a return LHR - LGA  flight.Final answer.It's expensive for what it is given the plethora of burger options in the capital these days - I understand these complaints! But I also think:- the Shack bun is great;- I also have a bizarre nostalgia for crinkle cut fries even though they're not my favourite by taste alone;- the white and green Shack print - complete with burgers and fries and wine and mini ice cream cones - brings a smile to my face;- the concretes (blended frozen custard with ""stuff""; think, fancy McFlurry) can come with pre-selected add-ins (flavourful jams, chunks of St. John's baked goods) or you can design your own. I love a small cup of custard (it's rich enough to stop at small) with a side of peanut butter sauce. Salty (ish) sauce over a sweet creamy cup of custard?

1720	4.0	"As a native Californian, I must of course denounce Shake Shack for the greater In-N-Out Burger, but I will say that Shake Shack is better at their namesake, the milkshakes. The number of flavours available and the creamy goodness that is their shakes just add up to make the perfect shake. Their burgers are also good, just small, especially for the price you have to pay for them. I have had the ShackBurger, SmokeShake, and 'Shroom Burger, all of which were delicious. The cheesy fries are also amazing, and we keep coming back for them since my boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with them. The crinkle-cut fries themselves are the perfect combination of crispiness and potatoes. Oh, and their seasonal mango lemonade is so good! It's hard to find good, fresh lemonade made with lemons in London (mostly just that ""cloudy"" fizzy lemonade). Overall, this Shake Shack is a good reminder of New York/East Coast, and is very delicious. Just wish it were cheaper."	as a native californian  i must of course denounce shake shack for the greater in n out burger  but i will say that shake shack is better at their namesake  the milkshakes  the number of flavours available and the creamy goodness that is their shakes just add up to make the perfect shake  their burgers are also good  just small  especially for the price you have to pay for them  i have had the shackburger  smokeshake  and  shroom burger  all of which were delicious  the cheesy fries are also amazing  and we keep coming back for them since my boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with them  the crinkle cut fries themselves are the perfect combination of crispiness and potatoes  oh  and their seasonal mango lemonade is so good  it s hard to find good  fresh lemonade made with lemons in london  mostly just that  cloudy  fizzy lemonade   overall  this shake shack is a good reminder of new york east coast  and is very delicious  just wish it were cheaper

1723	4.0	Nom Nom Nom. I'd been hearing amazing things about Shake Shack, and I was working in Covent Garden for 2 whole days with it teasing me at every stomach groan. Finally my friends caved in and we arrived at Shake Shack just before closing (almost 10:30pm and I hadn't eaten since breakfast - yes you can imagine my delight.I went for the original double cheese burger (KISS) and seasoned fries washed down with a nice pint of their house lager. Great tasting burger and lovely fries - I have a soft spot crinkled fries - don't hate me I'm just weird.I will refrain from a 5 star on this occasion as I have had better burgers and I really really really thought SS was going to demand a 5 due to how hungry I was at the time.The set up is great here though and the order system seems to work pretty flawlessly - needed in such a busy area! Staff were friendly and chatty, even at the darker side of the watershed and all in all SS seem like a cool company.	nom nom nom  i d been hearing amazing things about shake shack  and i was working in covent garden for 2 whole days with it teasing me at every stomach groan  finally my friends caved in and we arrived at shake shack just before closing  almost 10 30pm and i hadn t eaten since breakfast   yes you can imagine my delight i went for the original double cheese burger  kiss  and seasoned fries washed down with a nice pint of their house lager  great tasting burger and lovely fries   i have a soft spot crinkled fries   don t hate me i m just weird i will refrain from a 5 star on this occasion as i have had better burgers and i really really really thought ss was going to demand a 5 due to how hungry i was at the time the set up is great here though and the order system seems to work pretty flawlessly   needed in such a busy area  staff were friendly and chatty  even at the darker side of the watershed and all in all ss seem like a cool company 
1724	4.0	First off, I'm so bummed out California doesn't have a Shake Shack because the mushroom burger IS SO AMAZING.I never have high expectations for either fast food/chain restaurants or mushroom burgers of any sort, but if you like crispy onion rings and garlic-y cheese, it's the way to go. The portabello mushroom is coated and deep fried to a lovely crisp and cheese oozes out when you bite into it.Go during weekdays for less of a line, and the staff is very friendly and courteous. Be warned, portions are not large for what you pay, so get the Shake Stack if you want to try the mushroom + a little more!m	first off  i m so bummed out california doesn t have a shake shack because the mushroom burger is so amazing i never have high expectations for either fast food chain restaurants or mushroom burgers of any sort  but if you like crispy onion rings and garlic y cheese  it s the way to go  the portabello mushroom is coated and deep fried to a lovely crisp and cheese oozes out when you bite into it go during weekdays for less of a line  and the staff is very friendly and courteous  be warned  portions are not large for what you pay  so get the shake stack if you want to try the mushroom   a little more m

1726	4.0	We had been waiting for Shake Shack to open for some time now and finally we feasted! It is very exciting to have both Five Guys and Shake Shack open in London and in the same area. We have tried various Shake Shack NYC locations as well as Dubai so there was much anticipation for this new opening.Burger tasted the same as always with a juicy patty and soft squishy bun. We went on a Sunday and had the blueberry coffee cake custard special. The custard was quite good and not as sweet as some of the other flavors/concretes we have had previously.Queues look long but the line actually moves along quite quickly.	we had been waiting for shake shack to open for some time now and finally we feasted  it is very exciting to have both five guys and shake shack open in london and in the same area  we have tried various shake shack nyc locations as well as dubai so there was much anticipation for this new opening burger tasted the same as always with a juicy patty and soft squishy bun  we went on a sunday and had the blueberry coffee cake custard special  the custard was quite good and not as sweet as some of the other flavors concretes we have had previously queues look long but the line actually moves along quite quickly 
1727	4.0	Opened the same time as Five Guys as the heavyweight American giants burger battled it off for the public's attention.There is only one winner for me. Shakeshack has a superior burger that really lets the meat sing with less emphasise on the toppings, but they come as a support act. It's lovingly given out when ordered, with a nod to being photographed.They also have crinkle cut fries unlike many places. With some fake cheese. The ice cream and shake is very good though. It's also housed within the beautiful Covent Garden market with some classy seating. This is a winner for me. Not my fav burger in London. But they have given everything a lot of considered thought and kept a good quality product that has translated well from the States.	opened the same time as five guys as the heavyweight american giants burger battled it off for the public s attention there is only one winner for me  shakeshack has a superior burger that really lets the meat sing with less emphasise on the toppings  but they come as a support act  it s lovingly given out when ordered  with a nod to being photographed they also have crinkle cut fries unlike many places  with some fake cheese  the ice cream and shake is very good though  it s also housed within the beautiful covent garden market with some classy seating  this is a winner for me  not my fav burger in london  but they have given everything a lot of considered thought and kept a good quality product that has translated well from the states 
1728	4.0	Yes it's a franchise and yet another burger joint but Shake Shack has served them up well as the burgers seem more freshly prepared with crispier lettuce and softer buns than say Five Guys for example.

1731	4.0	You'd think that I would have made it to the ORIGINAL Shake Shack in NYC (which is technically closer to me than London) but noooooooooooooo! My first Shake Shack experience was actually at the London outpost, and it was really good! Old fashioned style burger with a warm, steamed bun and a unique UK bent. I tried the coffee milkshake, which was amazing, as well as the Smoke Shack burger with British style bacon (not as fatty), chopped cherry pepper and special sauce. There was a bit of a mix-up with our order, so we had to flag someone down after we saw pretty much EVERY surrounding table who had ordered after us get their food before we did. They apologized and gave us some extra fries, which was nice of them! I didn't have high hopes for the crinkle-cut fries, but they were actually really good. Lunch on a Thursday wasn't too busy when we ordered just past 12, but around 12:30-1 it started getting a little bit crazy. So try to go early or late, and get one of the shakes!	you d think that i would have made it to the original shake shack in nyc  which is technically closer to me than london  but noooooooooooooo  my first shake shack experience was actually at the london outpost  and it was really good  old fashioned style burger with a warm  steamed bun and a unique uk bent  i tried the coffee milkshake  which was amazing  as well as the smoke shack burger with british style bacon  not as fatty   chopped cherry pepper and special sauce  there was a bit of a mix up with our order  so we had to flag someone down after we saw pretty much every surrounding table who had ordered after us get their food before we did  they apologized and gave us some extra fries  which was nice of them  i didn t have high hopes for the crinkle cut fries  but they were actually really good  lunch on a thursday wasn t too busy when we ordered just past 12  but around 12 30 1 it started getting a little bit crazy  so try to go early or late  and get one of the shakes

Because of the cold weather I went inside and started eating standing and it took their worker 40 seconds to get me a table even though I didn't asked.Awesome :)	this is how you combine a fast food chain with some personal touch and professional action this guys are pros  everything tic tucks  workers are pros  great warm food  5 stars service it s kinda crowdy  outside there was plenty of free tables  but non inside  because of the cold weather i went inside and started eating standing and it took their worker 40 seconds to get me a table even though i didn t asked awesome

1734	4.0	Well, i'm glad i experienced that. Twice. I heard of Shake Shack for so long that when i heard of it i waited for my baby brother to come visit and we ran there. You'll notice a lot of reviews mention the big affluence at SS but i always went off hours and didn't experience it. Might be a tip for you if you don't like to queue.I opted for the double cheese burger both times and the cheesy fries. The burger is pretty and tasty, the meat is good but the most amazing thing are these fries. They're to die for, really. I'm not too much of a fries person but i'd eat the Shake Shack's anytime. The cheese sauce that goes with it is spread on the fries which makes them go soft so i advise you ask them to give it to you separately as a dip to not lose the crunchiness. I also tried to homemade lemonade and found it to my taste. They propose two sitting area, one in the Apple Market gallery which kind of counts as outdoors and an indoors area which is very small so you're unlikely to find a spot. They give you a kind of remote that goes flashing and buzzing when your food is ready. If you intend to eat on site you have time to go find a seat and wait there rather than just stand over the counter and awkwardly wait on the way of people walking through the gallery.Finally, they have toilets ! Which i thought was too good to be true. But a staircase in the indoor sitting area will lead you to it.	well  i m glad i experienced that  twice  i heard of shake shack for so long that when i heard of it i waited for my baby brother to come visit and we ran there  you ll notice a lot of reviews mention the big affluence at ss but i always went off hours and didn t experience it  might be a tip for you if you don t like to queue i opted for the double cheese burger both times and the cheesy fries  the burger is pretty and tasty  the meat is good but the most amazing thing are these fries  they re to die for  really  i m not too much of a fries person but i d eat the shake shack s anytime  the cheese sauce that goes with it is spread on the fries which makes them go soft so i advise you ask them to give it to you separately as a dip to not lose the crunchiness  i also tried to homemade lemonade and found it to my taste  they propose two sitting area  one in the apple market gallery which kind of counts as outdoors and an indoors area which is very small so you re unlikely to find a spot  they give you a kind of remote that goes flashing and buzzing when your food is ready  if you intend to eat on site you have time to go find a seat and wait there rather than just stand over the counter and awkwardly wait on the way of people walking through the gallery finally  they have toilets   which i thought was too good to be true  but a staircase in the indoor sitting area will lead you to it 
1735	2.0	So overrated for what you get. I've had much better burgers with service for the same price. Sure they are better then McDonalds but at a much higher premium. You may as well go to Bryron which is similar priced with proper service. Crinkle cut fries were OK but I much prefer thicker chips offered by other burger joints. Burgers were too greasy for my taste and too small.	so overrated for what you get  i ve had much better burgers with service for the same price  sure they are better then mcdonalds but at a much higher premium  you may as well go to bryron which is similar priced with proper service  crinkle cut fries were ok but i much prefer thicker chips offered by other burger joints  burgers were too greasy for my taste and too small

I fell in love with Shake Shack when I was in NY and it's so nice to be able to have it here !First, I love to eat in Covent Garden : don't bother to find a place inside and just eat outside to feel the crowd and the atmosphere !Then, you have to try the Shroom Burger. Yes, it's vegetarian but trust me you won't regret it ! So much cheeeeeeese it's insane !So obviously, if you don't mind paying extra money : try the Shack Stack : it doesn't get better than this !And finally, you don't want to miss the cheese fries : delicious !! (Hopefully the cool will be in the mood for extra cheese topping, but sometimes it's a little bit light on the cheese)That's my go-to menu when I eat at Shake Shack but I have to try the hot dogs too...	one of my favourite place to eat a burger in london  i fell in love with shake shack when i was in ny and it s so nice to be able to have it here  first  i love to eat in covent garden   don t bother to find a place inside and just eat outside to feel the crowd and the atmosphere  then  you have to try the shroom burger  yes  it s vegetarian but trust me you won t regret it   so much cheeeeeeese it s insane  so obviously  if you don t mind paying extra money   try the shack stack   it doesn t get better than this  and finally  you don t want to miss the cheese fries   delicious     hopefully the cool will be in the mood for extra cheese topping  but sometimes it s a little bit light on the cheese that s my go to menu when i eat at shake shack but i have to try the hot dogs too   
1737	4.0	So my dog rolled in the venue like she was hot stuff and put down an order of bag o' bones. According to her scoffing and the crunching noise from here to yonder, i'd say the biscuits went down a hoot! She even left a few crumbles behind to mark her territory! I have to say I was very excited when I found out that they served dog treats but even more ecstatic when I was told my pooch could trot on in and dine on some munchies there! So many times when i'm out and about and in need of a good ol' binge my dog has restricted me from dining in the finest of finest fast food chains. I suppose I have her to thank for my low fat diet. The crinkle cut chips are to die for! Not over saturated with hydrogenated oil and have just the right amount of crisp. You can tell they are quite healthy, if chips were ever healthy! Well hey, it is a vegetable....1 of your 5 a day. Overall great service. I held up the queue when I asked about the dog food available but the servers were accommodating without showing any irritation or dismissive behaviour.	so my dog rolled in the venue like she was hot stuff and put down an order of bag o  bones  according to her scoffing and the crunching noise from here to yonder  i d say the biscuits went down a hoot  she even left a few crumbles behind to mark her territory  i have to say i was very excited when i found out that they served dog treats but even more ecstatic when i was told my pooch could trot on in and dine on some munchies there  so many times when i m out and about and in need of a good ol  binge my dog has restricted me from dining in the finest of finest fast food chains  i suppose i have her to thank for my low fat diet  the crinkle cut chips are to die for  not over saturated with hydrogenated oil and have just the right amount of crisp  you can tell they are quite healthy  if chips were ever healthy  well hey  it is a vegetable    1 of your 5 a day  overall great service  i held up the queue when i asked about the dog food available but the servers were accommodating without showing any irritation or dismissive behaviour 
1738	1.0	My wife & I went there for some late night sweets (milk shake & custard). Man, it turned out to be a bad experience. We waited for over 15 minutes & still didn't get our order. Other people who ordered after us got served before us. When I asked what was going on, I was met with blank stares. A couple that was with us who also ordered ice creams & after the more than 15 minute wait were told it would be two minutes. I complained to the on-duty supervisor & asked for a refund. When I got it & was leaving, I heard a loud crash sound & saw that an employee had dropped a large milkshake which spilled all over the floor.

1739	2.0	I was really disappointed with Shake Shack. I don't get the hype around it.This is London, we have so many brilliant places to get a burger. Patty & Bun immediately comes to mind but off the top of my head; Tommi's Burger Joint, Honest Burgers, Meat Liquor. Hell even Byron and GBK are better than Shake Shack. At least at all of those places you can sit down and take your time. Conversely you could, technically speaking, argue that Shack Shake is fast food so it's targeting a different customer, one who needs their food quickly and doesn't have the luxury of time. However, you'd have to kick yourself in the shin after discovering the queues at this place basically reach to the moon.The burger wasn't bad. It was small but extremely juicy.  The fries were alright, although I feel like this crinkle cut thing must just be a bad marketing gimmick, a desperate gesture to set them apart from market rivals. They weren't very crispy and the portion was pretty little. I wouldn't mind paying for a larger size but there didn't seem to be the option.Let's begin at the fact that this is not a dining experience, it's a fast food experience so these high prices are not particularly justifiable. There will be a massive queue because Londoners want to see what the hype is, Americans miss Shake Shack in the park and tourists are lost and hungry. Then let's talk about the small portions, the fact that some of the seating is outside which in the winter makes for a pretty toe tingling experience, especially when you're sipping on a cold drink and did I mention this is basically just like a McDonalds except you don't get to sit inside because the seats are going to be full.The malted chocolate milkshake was excellent though and I really can't fault them on that as it's not even something rival Five Guys can offer and it's something that is missing from a few well respected burger places in London, so hats off to SS for getting it right. Unfortunately I don't feel it makes up for the other shortcomings and wouldn't come back here unless I had nowhere else to go. Five Guys is just around the corner and Honest Burger not that much further away in Soho as well as probably at least one Byron and GBK in between. I don't see a reason to come to SS although they do sell a little bag of dog treats which I grabbed because I'm a sucker. My dog seemed to enjoy it, should I add an extra star for that?	i was really disappointed with shake shack  i don t get the hype around it this is london  we have so many brilliant places to get a burger  patty   bun immediately comes to mind but off the top of my head  tommi s burger joint  honest burgers  meat liquor  hell even byron and gbk are better than shake shack  at least at all of those places you can sit down and take your time  conversely you could  technically speaking  argue that shack shake is fast food so it s targeting a different customer  one who needs their food quickly and doesn t have the luxury of time  however  you d have to kick yourself in the shin after discovering the queues at this place basically reach to the moon the burger wasn t bad  it was small but extremely juicy   the fries were alright  although i feel like this crinkle cut thing must just be a bad marketing gimmick  a desperate gesture to set them apart from market rivals  they weren t very crispy and the portion was pretty little  i wouldn t mind paying for a larger size but there didn t seem to be the option let s begin at the fact that this is not a dining experience  it s a fast food experience so these high prices are not particularly justifiable  there will be a massive queue because londoners want to see what the hype is  americans miss shake shack in the park and tourists are lost and hungry  then let s talk about the small portions  the fact that some of the seating is outside which in the winter makes for a pretty toe tingling experience  especially when you re sipping on a cold drink and did i mention this is basically just like a mcdonalds except you don t get to sit inside because the seats are going to be full the malted chocolate milkshake was excellent though and i really can t fault them on that as it s not even something rival five guys can offer and it s something that is missing from a few well respected burger places in london  so hats off to ss for getting it right  unfortunately i don t feel it makes up for the other shortcomings and wouldn t come back here unless i had nowhere else to go  five guys is just around the corner and honest burger not that much further away in soho as well as probably at least one byron and gbk in between  i don t see a reason to come to ss although they do sell a little bag of dog treats which i grabbed because i m a sucker  my dog seemed to enjoy it  should i add an extra star for that 
1740	4.0	"So this last week seems to have turned into an unofficial and unplanned mission to find the best burger in London. Now I've always had burgers on the brain and last weeks visit to Tommi's set the bar pretty damn high, but whilst walking through Covent Garden last night, a lightbulb moment occurred when I thought ""I really must try this shake shack that everyone's talking about at the moment""From what I hear were chaotic scenes of incredible bovine demand upon opening, last night's queues were tame in comparison although on a wind and rain swept Tuesday evening, I still had to wait at least 10 minutes just to get in the door. Once in it was rapid and easy to order, with a further 5 minute wait afterwards to collect my order. My choices were the double shake burger, regular fries (the cheese sauce just looked a little bit too funky for my liking) and a pint of the exclusively brewed for Shake Shack beer from Brooklyn brewery. Some quick points about what I thought: 1. The burger was freaking amazing - literally one of the best I've ever had. As good as In'n'Out in the States? I don't know but it sure would be fun to do a blind taste test sometime soon!2. The chips were really not to my liking at all, maybe the cheese sauce I avoided disguises them but they reminded me of the sort of McCains crinkle cut french fries my mum used to buy a sack of for £1. Dry and tasteless, this was like putting a clapped out old banger next to a Ferrari.3. Brooklyn beer FTW - everything they do I love so much. This beer was a little less malty than their normal brew so went perfectly well with the burger and fries. If you like good beer don't miss out. They also seemed to do a good range of other craft beers and was nice to see Thornbridge's Jaipur making an appearance in their bottle fridge. So a fairly successful visit in the end, my only other comment is that for the most basic burger, basic fries and a pint, I found £14.50 pretty steep. Maybe we're now in an era of post-fast food where places like Meat Liquor have beaten down the door and people are willing to pay more. Judging by the popularity of this branch, they're not going to have any shortage of people handing over their hard earned cash any time soon and I'll likely be one of them!"	so this last week seems to have turned into an unofficial and unplanned mission to find the best burger in london  now i ve always had burgers on the brain and last weeks visit to tommi s set the bar pretty damn high  but whilst walking through covent garden last night  a lightbulb moment occurred when i thought  i really must try this shake shack that everyone s talking about at the moment from what i hear were chaotic scenes of incredible bovine demand upon opening  last night s queues were tame in comparison although on a wind and rain swept tuesday evening  i still had to wait at least 10 minutes just to get in the door  once in it was rapid and easy to order  with a further 5 minute wait afterwards to collect my order  my choices were the double shake burger  regular fries  the cheese sauce just looked a little bit too funky for my liking  and a pint of the exclusively brewed for shake shack beer from brooklyn brewery  some quick points about what i thought  1  the burger was freaking amazing   literally one of the best i ve ever had  as good as in n out in the states  i don t know but it sure would be fun to do a blind taste test sometime soon 2  the chips were really not to my liking at all  maybe the cheese sauce i avoided disguises them but they reminded me of the sort of mccains crinkle cut french fries my mum used to buy a sack of for  1  dry and tasteless  this was like putting a clapped out old banger next to a ferrari 3  brooklyn beer ftw   everything they do i love so much  this beer was a little less malty than their normal brew so went perfectly well with the burger and fries  if you like good beer don t miss out  they also seemed to do a good range of other craft beers and was nice to see thornbridge s jaipur making an appearance in their bottle fridge  so a fairly successful visit in the end  my only other comment is that for the most basic burger  basic fries and a pint  i found  14 50 pretty steep  maybe we re now in an era of post fast food where places like meat liquor have beaten down the door and people are willing to pay more  judging by the popularity of this branch  they re not going to have any shortage of people handing over their hard earned cash any time soon and i ll likely be one of them

They have plenty of seating, no trouble troubles to get a seat quickly.Nice to re-discover this burger chain again, and the menu is the same in the US. I always go for the simple cheeseburger. My order was taken quickly, but the wait after was quite. But this not why I giving three stars. Maybe I was unlucky that day, I found the meat really really salty :(Sad it ruined the experience and I had better souvenir of it in my memories.. The bun is really nice, I like the brioche style. Except this, I still recommend Shake Shack for their tasty meat.Price are correct, and staff really friendly.A great moment still, which can be improved...	even it is located right in the middle of covent garden  it can be difficult to see it discreet front door  but long line  here we are  they have plenty of seating  no trouble troubles to get a seat quickly nice to re discover this burger chain again  and the menu is the same in the us  i always go for the simple cheeseburger  my order was taken quickly  but the wait after was quite  but this not why i giving three stars  maybe i was unlucky that day  i found the meat really really salty   sad it ruined the experience and i had better souvenir of it in my memories   the bun is really nice  i like the brioche style  except this  i still recommend shake shack for their tasty meat price are correct  and staff really friendly a great moment still  which can be improved   
1744	3.0	As a lover of in-n-out, I thought it necessary to test out the competition. I ordered the shack burger- a basic burger. The cheese on it was good and I enjoyed that the pattie, tomatoes and lettuce tasted fresh. The chips are quiet delicious as well, but nothing spectacular. The shake was a bit of a disappointment. The cup was about 4/5 full and if I'm going to pay £5 for a shake, I expect it to be a full shake.I'm only giving shake shack three stars because it was good but nothing spectacular. Just an average (and expensive) burger place.	as a lover of in n out  i thought it necessary to test out the competition  i ordered the shack burger  a basic burger  the cheese on it was good and i enjoyed that the pattie  tomatoes and lettuce tasted fresh  the chips are quiet delicious as well  but nothing spectacular  the shake was a bit of a disappointment  the cup was about 4 5 full and if i m going to pay  5 for a shake  i expect it to be a full shake i m only giving shake shack three stars because it was good but nothing spectacular  just an average  and expensive  burger place 
1745	2.0	To me, Shake Shack is pure hype, and over expensive hype at that!It is just a tad above McDonalds. I think because it has come from across the pond; NYC, people think it's ok to queue like a fool! and pay a small fortune for Mediocre burger and chips. It's fast food, that's all. Fries with fake cheese sauce, tiny hot dog! And a beer, was around £14..burger was flat and just had no life or filling to it!No no no. I won't be drawn into this game. Service was fine, but not even that will get me back.	to me  shake shack is pure hype  and over expensive hype at that it is just a tad above mcdonalds  i think because it has come from across the pond  nyc  people think it s ok to queue like a fool  and pay a small fortune for mediocre burger and chips  it s fast food  that s all  fries with fake cheese sauce  tiny hot dog  and a beer  was around  14  burger was flat and just had no life or filling to it no no no  i won t be drawn into this game  service was fine  but not even that will get me back

1747	4.0	I came here and thought, holy smoly this Shack Stack (a Cheeseburger and a Shroom Burger together) is amazing!!! The cheese literally melts in your mouth, the mushroom is huge and super moist and juicy when you bite into it, and the burger is enough to feed you and a kid sized version of you!I made the mistake of also ordering cheesy fries and milkshake. The cheesy fries got very sickly after having a few bites, there is just too much cheese to process. The portion is as American sized as you can get. The fries are nothing worth dying for, in fact one time I came here for the burger and ordered the cajun fries from Five Guys instead. I think you could buy those McCains oven chips and it would be the same as these.Milkshake is also uninspiring. One time I ordered the Black and White (hope I got the name right) which apparently should be a mix of chocolate and vanilla but when it came it just looked and tasted like vanilla, so I was quite confused.Still, this is a burger joint, and their burger is amazing. 4* for you sir. A last note about waiting times, it does take a while which is not nice in the chilly British weather, but the burger is oh so worth it.	i came here and thought  holy smoly this shack stack  a cheeseburger and a shroom burger together  is amazing    the cheese literally melts in your mouth  the mushroom is huge and super moist and juicy when you bite into it  and the burger is enough to feed you and a kid sized version of you i made the mistake of also ordering cheesy fries and milkshake  the cheesy fries got very sickly after having a few bites  there is just too much cheese to process  the portion is as american sized as you can get  the fries are nothing worth dying for  in fact one time i came here for the burger and ordered the cajun fries from five guys instead  i think you could buy those mccains oven chips and it would be the same as these milkshake is also uninspiring  one time i ordered the black and white  hope i got the name right  which apparently should be a mix of chocolate and vanilla but when it came it just looked and tasted like vanilla  so i was quite confused still  this is a burger joint  and their burger is amazing  4  for you sir  a last note about waiting times  it does take a while which is not nice in the chilly british weather  but the burger is oh so worth it 
1748	4.0	Ah it was good to get a taste of home in the most beautiful part of London.Shake Shack has always been my favorite burger chain, and the one in London did not disappoint.  As always, I went for the Shack Stack, which was done well enough to make me feel like I was having it like I always did in NYC.  Having said that, the mushroom they used in the burger was a bit too stiff and chewy, so I had to leave that out as I indulged myself in the rest of the burger.I also ordered the strawberry milkshake, which was perfect.  Not too sweet and done just right, I went through the whole meal without a single drop of water or coke but still satisfied just with my milkshake.One warning is that the seating area is quite limited, so be sure to leave some extra time for waiting in the line to be seated.  Having said that, the queue moved relatively fast, so not a deal breaker.	ah it was good to get a taste of home in the most beautiful part of london shake shack has always been my favorite burger chain  and the one in london did not disappoint   as always  i went for the shack stack  which was done well enough to make me feel like i was having it like i always did in nyc   having said that  the mushroom they used in the burger was a bit too stiff and chewy  so i had to leave that out as i indulged myself in the rest of the burger i also ordered the strawberry milkshake  which was perfect   not too sweet and done just right  i went through the whole meal without a single drop of water or coke but still satisfied just with my milkshake one warning is that the seating area is quite limited  so be sure to leave some extra time for waiting in the line to be seated   having said that  the queue moved relatively fast  so not a deal breaker 
1749	2.0	"Overhyped, overpriced and over-it. Apologies in advance for the long one...I've looked forward to trying Shake Shack for weeks and as a result fell completely for the hype. Having been past Covent Garden a few times in the past few weeks, once thing has become a regular feature of the centre square. A queue at Shake Shack. So it should be good right? Wrong.The queue wasn't too bad on Tuesday evening a few weeks after opening. It only took 20 minutes or so to get to the till, and sadly things from there on went downhill. Whilst the staff are certainly pleasant enough, the management is dire. As a non-beef eater I expected ShakeShack to be willing to cater to this by replacing the Beef hotdog in their signature Shack-cago Dog meal to a pork one. I mean if McDonald's can have a completely modular menu, why can't Shake Shack be accommodating I thought. But no, it's impossible. Know this. Switching out a beef sausage for a pork one is impossible. Laughably, I was told that I could order a plain sausage in bread and add all the ingredients of the Shack-cago Dog as; get this ""Extras"" in separate containers, at at likely cost of double whatever the Shack-cago Dog costs, and I'd have to construct this myself. Such PR is just priceless and embarassing. So I decided to spare their blushes and order a Shackmeister Sausage. From the puzzled look on the managers face it appears I asked a question that had never been asked before. I can't imagine anyone has asked if their meat is Halal. I certaintly wouldn't bother. Just assume NO is the word.You're given a buzzer after ordering and service is slowww. No joke, the food here is easier to make than McDonald's, however the kitchen is inefficiently run. A sausage in bread covered in squeezy tube cheese and fried onions should not take 15 minutes or so. To make things worse, a friends meal was given to him without his shake with the promise his shake would follow. 10 minutes later, no shake. He went to get it. 10 minutes after getting up to find it, he arrived with his shake. Teething problems as a new restaurant? HOW, when they don't even customise orders in the slightest??!! A robot could make this food...Onto the food. The only things worth coming here for were the fries which were the right side of crispy and the peanut butter shake. Avoid the hot-dogs. A student cooking at 3am could produce more exciting fare. It's essentially hot-dog bread with a cumberland sausage in it topped with cheese and crispy onions if you so wish. Disappointing to the max. The shake was tasty, but far too small for the price. To be fair I heard better things about the burgers, so stick to beef if you can. Oh btw, the pork is from a rare breed of pig. Yay, that makes it alright!So essentially Byron and GBK which aren't even close to my favourite places have nothing to fear. Sure Shake Shack will get consistent football based on it's prime location but after the hype dies down, they're sure to struggle to fill those many many tables they have. No value for money, cheap overpriced rubbish non-beef options, no toppings for hotdogs, tiny portions...just save your time and money..."	overhyped  overpriced and over it  apologies in advance for the long one   i ve looked forward to trying shake shack for weeks and as a result fell completely for the hype  having been past covent garden a few times in the past few weeks  once thing has become a regular feature of the centre square  a queue at shake shack  so it should be good right  wrong the queue wasn t too bad on tuesday evening a few weeks after opening  it only took 20 minutes or so to get to the till  and sadly things from there on went downhill  whilst the staff are certainly pleasant enough  the management is dire  as a non beef eater i expected shakeshack to be willing to cater to this by replacing the beef hotdog in their signature shack cago dog meal to a pork one  i mean if mcdonald s can have a completely modular menu  why can t shake shack be accommodating i thought  but no  it s impossible  know this  switching out a beef sausage for a pork one is impossible  laughably  i was told that i could order a plain sausage in bread and add all the ingredients of the shack cago dog as  get this  extras  in separate containers  at at likely cost of double whatever the shack cago dog costs  and i d have to construct this myself  such pr is just priceless and embarassing  so i decided to spare their blushes and order a shackmeister sausage  from the puzzled look on the managers face it appears i asked a question that had never been asked before  i can t imagine anyone has asked if their meat is halal  i certaintly wouldn t bother  just assume no is the word you re given a buzzer after ordering and service is slowww  no joke  the food here is easier to make than mcdonald s  however the kitchen is inefficiently run  a sausage in bread covered in squeezy tube cheese and fried onions should not take 15 minutes or so  to make things worse  a friends meal was given to him without his shake with the promise his shake would follow  10 minutes later  no shake  he went to get it  10 minutes after getting up to find it  he arrived with his shake  teething problems as a new restaurant  how  when they don t even customise orders in the slightest     a robot could make this food   onto the food  the only things worth coming here for were the fries which were the right side of crispy and the peanut butter shake  avoid the hot dogs  a student cooking at 3am could produce more exciting fare  it s essentially hot dog bread with a cumberland sausage in it topped with cheese and crispy onions if you so wish  disappointing to the max  the shake was tasty  but far too small for the price  to be fair i heard better things about the burgers  so stick to beef if you can  oh btw  the pork is from a rare breed of pig  yay  that makes it alright so essentially byron and gbk which aren t even close to my favourite places have nothing to fear  sure shake shack will get consistent football based on it s prime location but after the hype dies down  they re sure to struggle to fill those many many tables they have  no value for money  cheap overpriced rubbish non beef options  no toppings for hotdogs  tiny portions   just save your time and money   
1750	4.0	Shake Shack has finally arrived in London and I made sure to get there at 10AM on opening day. Luckily it wasn't too crowded and I got a couple of freebies while waiting in line. There were about a million people working, but all the staff members I encountered were on their A game. Everyone was nice and friendly which made my friends and I feel right at home.As for the food, I ordered a Shack Stack - a combination of their Shake burger + Shroom burger. The burger was cooked perfectly, just needed a bit of ketchup to make the taste pop. I also got a Concrete Strawberry and Banana Graham Cracker Custardy goodness (That's not the name, but maybe it should be!). Overall a delicious meal and an enjoyable time. Shake Shack at Covent Garden is huge and I think they are going to do very well at this location. It's open and airy and is right in the center of it all. Good burgers, amazing shakes, friendly staff... sounds like a winning combination to me.	shake shack has finally arrived in london and i made sure to get there at 10am on opening day  luckily it wasn t too crowded and i got a couple of freebies while waiting in line  there were about a million people working  but all the staff members i encountered were on their a game  everyone was nice and friendly which made my friends and i feel right at home as for the food  i ordered a shack stack   a combination of their shake burger   shroom burger  the burger was cooked perfectly  just needed a bit of ketchup to make the taste pop  i also got a concrete strawberry and banana graham cracker custardy goodness  that s not the name  but maybe it should be    overall a delicious meal and an enjoyable time  shake shack at covent garden is huge and i think they are going to do very well at this location  it s open and airy and is right in the center of it all  good burgers  amazing shakes  friendly staff    sounds like a winning combination to me

I had the peanut butter - it was really good. But also too thick - I probably spent more calories trying to suck it up the straw than it was packin!"	shake shack opened with lots of fanfare  probably because several burger shops were opening at the same time and this was the  fabled  shake shack from america however  having eaten at meatmarket just around the corner  i recommend you go there instead the burger from shake shack was average   i liked the soft bun and the medium rare patty  but loads of burger places now do it that way  and this was nothing special the one thing i might go back to shake shack for are their frozen custard shakes  i had the peanut butter   it was really good  but also too thick   i probably spent more calories trying to suck it up the straw than it was packin 
1752	3.0	It's good! Nothing to say it's good and tasty, just like the other Shake Shaks in NY. They don't have the fresh fries like the NY Shake Shack in the upper west side, but again, bout even the store in midtown has them. Such a pity! They were so good. Hope they bring them to all their other stores. Location is great, in Covet Garden, surrounded by many other pretty shops. It's pricey as hell (6,5€ for a tiny burger is just madness) but the quality is much better than all the other mainstream fast foods. Still far from top quality burgers, it places itself in between of gourmet burgers and mainstream fast food. Adding the fresh fries and slightly less greasy meat it could get 4 stars though.	it s good  nothing to say it s good and tasty  just like the other shake shaks in ny  they don t have the fresh fries like the ny shake shack in the upper west side  but again  bout even the store in midtown has them  such a pity  they were so good  hope they bring them to all their other stores  location is great  in covet garden  surrounded by many other pretty shops  it s pricey as hell  6 5  for a tiny burger is just madness  but the quality is much better than all the other mainstream fast foods  still far from top quality burgers  it places itself in between of gourmet burgers and mainstream fast food  adding the fresh fries and slightly less greasy meat it could get 4 stars though 
1753	4.0	Not too bad. I've gone to the original Shake Shack in NYC and I have to say it's much more enjoyable eating at the NYC location as all seating is outside. While the London location has both indoor and outdoor seating, both feel very cramped as Covent Garden is quite crowded. Also, the line to order is somewhat confusing as a walkway splits the line so many people accidentally cut in front of other people (at least when I was there in October).Now, on to the food. AMAZING FOOD! I actually completely forgot London had it's own Shake Shack, but boy was I happy when I came across it! I had the mushroom burger at the NYC location so I decided to go with a double cheeseburger and a side of cheese fries. Really delicious food. I'm still torn on the race between In-n-Out and Shake Shack, but it definitely blows any other fast food burger shop out of the water. I personally enjoyed the mushroom burger more, so next time I happen upon another Shake Shack that's what I'll be getting. Until then, I can only dream of when I'll be able to enjoy another Shake Shack burger!	not too bad  i ve gone to the original shake shack in nyc and i have to say it s much more enjoyable eating at the nyc location as all seating is outside  while the london location has both indoor and outdoor seating  both feel very cramped as covent garden is quite crowded  also  the line to order is somewhat confusing as a walkway splits the line so many people accidentally cut in front of other people  at least when i was there in october  now  on to the food  amazing food  i actually completely forgot london had it s own shake shack  but boy was i happy when i came across it  i had the mushroom burger at the nyc location so i decided to go with a double cheeseburger and a side of cheese fries  really delicious food  i m still torn on the race between in n out and shake shack  but it definitely blows any other fast food burger shop out of the water  i personally enjoyed the mushroom burger more  so next time i happen upon another shake shack that s what i ll be getting  until then  i can only dream of when i ll be able to enjoy another shake shack burger 
1754	5.0	I miss New York.  When Shake Shack opened in July, I was excited to relive my favorite New York burger again.  There's something about the beef in a New York Shake Shack burger that makes it so good. Unfortunately, I didn't think the beef in the London Shake Shack lived up to it. Perhaps it is all mental. If someone told me that Shake Shack found a way to ship LaFrieda burger patties to London, maybe I wouldn't have this mental notion that it tastes different.  Oh well, still an excellent burger.  I actually prefer the ambiance of eating in the Palazzo over any of the NY locations.  Madison Sq Park is cool the first time, but living 6 streets up probably made me take it for granted.  My typical order is a double shackburger, cheese fries, and a glass of ice water.  During the fall, I study the custard calendar and find out which days I need to trek over to get pumpkin pie frozen custard.  The crinkle fries are actually not great, but I'm a sucker for the cheese sauce.  Something about the fake, powdery cheese sauce does me in every time.  The NY Shacks have all changed to fresh cut fries.  Dear Shake Shack, when are you going to bring fresh cut fries to London?  Now, please and thank you.	i miss new york   when shake shack opened in july  i was excited to relive my favorite new york burger again   there s something about the beef in a new york shake shack burger that makes it so good  unfortunately  i didn t think the beef in the london shake shack lived up to it  perhaps it is all mental  if someone told me that shake shack found a way to ship lafrieda burger patties to london  maybe i wouldn t have this mental notion that it tastes different   oh well  still an excellent burger   i actually prefer the ambiance of eating in the palazzo over any of the ny locations   madison sq park is cool the first time  but living 6 streets up probably made me take it for granted   my typical order is a double shackburger  cheese fries  and a glass of ice water   during the fall  i study the custard calendar and find out which days i need to trek over to get pumpkin pie frozen custard   the crinkle fries are actually not great  but i m a sucker for the cheese sauce   something about the fake  powdery cheese sauce does me in every time   the ny shacks have all changed to fresh cut fries   dear shake shack  when are you going to bring fresh cut fries to london   now  please and thank you 
1755	1.0	I've visited Shake Shack on two occasions now and both times the experience has been really disappointing, overpriced and stressful. The food was nice - though on the second occasion we were given the wrong order but because we had waited so long, we had to eat it as we were so hungry and in a rush. Both times the service has been horrendous and really slow, especially as I say on the second visit when we had to wait for 45 minutes. Not too impressive for a 'fast food' joint. And an American one at that. We had the cheese burger with added bacon - though one of us didn't get the bacon! Along with fries and lemonade to drink. Costing about £15. Each. If you can bear terrible service, stressful surroundings and overpriced (not so) fast food then this is the place for you!	i ve visited shake shack on two occasions now and both times the experience has been really disappointing  overpriced and stressful  the food was nice   though on the second occasion we were given the wrong order but because we had waited so long  we had to eat it as we were so hungry and in a rush  both times the service has been horrendous and really slow  especially as i say on the second visit when we had to wait for 45 minutes  not too impressive for a  fast food  joint  and an american one at that  we had the cheese burger with added bacon   though one of us didn t get the bacon  along with fries and lemonade to drink  costing about  15  each  if you can bear terrible service  stressful surroundings and overpriced  not so  fast food then this is the place for you 
1756	4.0	After going to New York and the queues always being massive at the shake shack near to my hotel, I finally made it to the one in London. I had the shake burger, it was moist, pink on the inside and had the delicious shake shack sauce...yum yum. I would say that the Five Guys burger are tastier but I did enjoy it.The crinkly fries with cheesey sauce were also really good. Tho the cheesey sauce did not tasty that cheesey (how many times can I say cheesey in the one paragraph!!). I also had a large homemade lemonade which was rally nice, with the right amount if sour and sweetness. The large is pretty big so only get if you are really thirsty as it's over £3!The favourite thing I had was the concrete. This is a frozen custard desert with various toppings. They are creamy and delicious. Again not the cheapest at £4 for a small one. My full meal was over £15 which is a bit on the steep side. Tasty but would not go every day.	after going to new york and the queues always being massive at the shake shack near to my hotel  i finally made it to the one in london  i had the shake burger  it was moist  pink on the inside and had the delicious shake shack sauce   yum yum  i would say that the five guys burger are tastier but i did enjoy it the crinkly fries with cheesey sauce were also really good  tho the cheesey sauce did not tasty that cheesey  how many times can i say cheesey in the one paragraph     i also had a large homemade lemonade which was rally nice  with the right amount if sour and sweetness  the large is pretty big so only get if you are really thirsty as it s over  3 the favourite thing i had was the concrete  this is a frozen custard desert with various toppings  they are creamy and delicious  again not the cheapest at  4 for a small one  my full meal was over  15 which is a bit on the steep side  tasty but would not go every day 
1757	3.0	I think this place had so much hype going for it that when I actually visited, it was a bit disappointing.We were in a pretty large group and arrived around 6pm. The line went pretty quickly with only a 5 min wait to submit my order. They were all out of the Shackmeister Ale so I opted for a London Brewery Ale, single shack burger, and then I split fries and big blend with friends. We found a large table very quickly in the courtyard and waited for our buzzers to ring. One by one we were called up, but a number of us had parts missing from our order and one of the orders was wrong. It was utter chaos at the pass and any of us that had booze had to have our trays carried to the table by a Shake Shack server. The burger was... ok. The brioche bun was nice and light and the sauce was nice, but overall the burger felt a bit oily and bland. The fries were great, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. II would go back for the fries and the milkshake (tried a friend's), but not really anything else. The concrete BigBlend ended up being a cup of ice cream rather than a milkshake (as I had originally thought) which was again, disappointing.With the issues getting our food and the underwhelming burger, I would not be too pushed to stop by again until I have exhausted all other burger places in London... and that is going to take quite some time...	i think this place had so much hype going for it that when i actually visited  it was a bit disappointing we were in a pretty large group and arrived around 6pm  the line went pretty quickly with only a 5 min wait to submit my order  they were all out of the shackmeister ale so i opted for a london brewery ale  single shack burger  and then i split fries and big blend with friends  we found a large table very quickly in the courtyard and waited for our buzzers to ring  one by one we were called up  but a number of us had parts missing from our order and one of the orders was wrong  it was utter chaos at the pass and any of us that had booze had to have our trays carried to the table by a shake shack server  the burger was    ok  the brioche bun was nice and light and the sauce was nice  but overall the burger felt a bit oily and bland  the fries were great  crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  ii would go back for the fries and the milkshake  tried a friend s   but not really anything else  the concrete bigblend ended up being a cup of ice cream rather than a milkshake  as i had originally thought  which was again  disappointing with the issues getting our food and the underwhelming burger  i would not be too pushed to stop by again until i have exhausted all other burger places in london    and that is going to take quite some time   
1758	3.0	This is an American chain from NYC and eaten only because my daughter got to pick.  I eat fast food once in a while but not regularly.  I never had in the US bit was not impressed.  Gut feeling is may be better there but will have to try back there.  Also, this is based off one visit, you need many more to be certain of anything. Also, this restaurant is located in Covent Gardens main eating and shopping area and is chaotic due to the travel season. The area outside to get in has a wait before you could get in and was a bit confusing.  Once inside it was pretty fast paced and crazy.  We wanted to get a seat in their area but were bot allowed until we had our receipt and pager.  Once we did the woman that worked there was dealing with an irate customer about seating.....spoiled things a bit.  This area is famous in London for this shopping and eating area. It had great atmosphere so eating out in the airy space is part if the appeal.The wait was ling and Two of three burgers way underdone.  Too long a line and wait to take back so we ate.  Fries were made well and fresh bit not that tasty.  No refills on drinks but that is standard in Europe.  The restaurant has a cool trendy appeal but bot impressed based on this one visit.Will try in the States if I see one to compare.	this is an american chain from nyc and eaten only because my daughter got to pick   i eat fast food once in a while but not regularly   i never had in the us bit was not impressed   gut feeling is may be better there but will have to try back there   also  this is based off one visit  you need many more to be certain of anything  also  this restaurant is located in covent gardens main eating and shopping area and is chaotic due to the travel season  the area outside to get in has a wait before you could get in and was a bit confusing   once inside it was pretty fast paced and crazy   we wanted to get a seat in their area but were bot allowed until we had our receipt and pager   once we did the woman that worked there was dealing with an irate customer about seating     spoiled things a bit   this area is famous in london for this shopping and eating area  it had great atmosphere so eating out in the airy space is part if the appeal the wait was ling and two of three burgers way underdone   too long a line and wait to take back so we ate   fries were made well and fresh bit not that tasty   no refills on drinks but that is standard in europe   the restaurant has a cool trendy appeal but bot impressed based on this one visit will try in the states if i see one to compare 
1759	5.0	Everything I hoped it would be! I have been wanting to try Shake Shack for a while so when I heard they were opening in London I dribbled everywhere. Was lucky enough to try out their food today and I can honestly say that Shake Shack know how to make a burger. The bun was the perfect kind of soft. The meat was the perfect temperature and texture. The sauce was like the sauce of life. Long live Shake Shack. It's not even open yet but I know I'll be back many times!	everything i hoped it would be  i have been wanting to try shake shack for a while so when i heard they were opening in london i dribbled everywhere  was lucky enough to try out their food today and i can honestly say that shake shack know how to make a burger  the bun was the perfect kind of soft  the meat was the perfect temperature and texture  the sauce was like the sauce of life  long live shake shack  it s not even open yet but i know i ll be back many times

Which is a good thing!  From the crinkle fries to the burgers to the frozen custard - my absolute favorite dessert in London - Shake Shack really does live up to it's New York famed reputation.   The frozen custard flavors change every week, then every month so there's always something new to try - and a great excuses to eat it every time you're visiting Covent Garden.	one of the only fast food restaurants to put me in a food coma  which is a good thing   from the crinkle fries to the burgers to the frozen custard   my absolute favorite dessert in london   shake shack really does live up to it s new york famed reputation    the frozen custard flavors change every week  then every month so there s always something new to try   and a great excuses to eat it every time you re visiting covent garden 
1761	4.0	"Such a great decadent lunch if you are in Covent garden. I have been to Shake Shack a few times and it is always a sure thing. If you are going to go, make sure that you are hungry, not at the ""hangry"" stage yet as the queue is always insane and you will be waiting. It took about 25 mins to order the other day and then another 20 or so to get my food. Not exactly fast food, but so worth the wait. I had the cheese fries and the shackburger. I really wanted a custard shake, but dont think my arteries would have managed, next time! Good tip is that if you are with someone else, send them in line for a table while you wait for your food, otherwise you face ANOTHER queue whilst you have a tray of food. Or if you are like me, get takeaway, find a curb, people watch and enjoy your instant shake shack gratification."	such a great decadent lunch if you are in covent garden  i have been to shake shack a few times and it is always a sure thing  if you are going to go  make sure that you are hungry  not at the  hangry  stage yet as the queue is always insane and you will be waiting  it took about 25 mins to order the other day and then another 20 or so to get my food  not exactly fast food  but so worth the wait  i had the cheese fries and the shackburger  i really wanted a custard shake  but dont think my arteries would have managed  next time  good tip is that if you are with someone else  send them in line for a table while you wait for your food  otherwise you face another queue whilst you have a tray of food  or if you are like me  get takeaway  find a curb  people watch and enjoy your instant shake shack gratification 
1762	4.0	This ShackBurger and I have been having an affair for years. I first met this New York institution a few years ago in Madison Square Park. After waiting in a super long line, we had our first date in the park and I knew I'd found a burger I would always love, no matter where in the world I was. When I heard that the ShackBurger was coming to London, I felt we would pick up where we left off. I have now been to Shake Shack quite a few times here in London and the ShackBurger is as reliably delicious and juicy as it has always been. I am a bit picky about how I like my burgers; I prefer medium rare to bring out that meaty flavour and I don't want it covered up by too many other competing sauce flavours. For me, the ShackBurger does that well, although it is a bit soft in texture, the taste is always great. The fries here are fine, and hit the spot with the burger. I have never had a problem with long lines here though and have always been lucky to not have to wait too long. I also like their system of giving you a pager to let you know when your order is ready. I like the fun vibe at Shake Shack and the cheerful staff. I was lucky enough to be at the launch as well, and it was an epic afternoon that held a lot of promise on which it has definitely delivered.I also really enjoy the concretes here, which are a thick ice creamy guilty pleasure. I have tried a few of the chocolatey persuasion and have enjoyed all the flavours without being able to pick a favourite yet. There are so many flavours that sound good that I feel I must plan a few more trips to try some more. My burger doesn't mind the competition, no matter what else comes and goes, the ShackBurger knows it will always have a place in my heart.	this shackburger and i have been having an affair for years  i first met this new york institution a few years ago in madison square park  after waiting in a super long line  we had our first date in the park and i knew i d found a burger i would always love  no matter where in the world i was  when i heard that the shackburger was coming to london  i felt we would pick up where we left off  i have now been to shake shack quite a few times here in london and the shackburger is as reliably delicious and juicy as it has always been  i am a bit picky about how i like my burgers  i prefer medium rare to bring out that meaty flavour and i don t want it covered up by too many other competing sauce flavours  for me  the shackburger does that well  although it is a bit soft in texture  the taste is always great  the fries here are fine  and hit the spot with the burger  i have never had a problem with long lines here though and have always been lucky to not have to wait too long  i also like their system of giving you a pager to let you know when your order is ready  i like the fun vibe at shake shack and the cheerful staff  i was lucky enough to be at the launch as well  and it was an epic afternoon that held a lot of promise on which it has definitely delivered i also really enjoy the concretes here  which are a thick ice creamy guilty pleasure  i have tried a few of the chocolatey persuasion and have enjoyed all the flavours without being able to pick a favourite yet  there are so many flavours that sound good that i feel i must plan a few more trips to try some more  my burger doesn t mind the competition  no matter what else comes and goes  the shackburger knows it will always have a place in my heart 
1763	5.0	Finally! It's here!After sampling a Shake in the states about 4 years ago I have yearned to repeat the experience and I got to do that on a invite only taster night.We basically sampled the whole menu in bits and pieces and boy are you guys in for a treat.Some may argue that London doesn't need another a burger joint, I beg to differ, in my eyes MeatMarkert was the only decent fast food burger, but with the arrival of Shake Shake, this changes.  Yes I would still head to all the other great burger places in London, Shake Shack is built for speed, grab a burger on the run, a higher class of McDonald's or Burger King if you will.The burgers are good, real good, don't expect the burgers to be cooked medium rare all the time, it's a fast food joint, mine had a slight tinge of pink but it didn't really matter, the flavour was awesome, angus beef at it's very best.  All three burger's are great in their own right, my personal fav was the Shake Stack, which is a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese stacked on top of a decelious Aberdeen Angus patty with all the usual trimmings and when that big ball of deep fried goodness popped my mouth I got a rush of  mushroom and cheesy goodness, really married up with the beef patty, the crinkle cut fries were also very good, good seasoning, crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside, also get the added cheese sauce, really good,  pure comfort food.  The drinks, you can get pretty much anything, wine, beer, soft drinks and of course milkshakes, now I didn't to sample the milkshakes here but all the food bloggers and fellow foodies around me were raving about them, I on the other hand hit the booze, a ShackMeister Ale, brewed especially for Shake Shack by Brooklyn Brewery, A perfect wing man for any burger, very similar to the Brooklyn Lager with a subtle difference, very refreshing.The layout is good, sit outside in the sun, inside the restaurant or out side in the court yard, you order your food, you get a little vibrating machine (steady on girls) and you get out the way, the machine then buzzes to tell you your food is ready, you collect your food, easy as that, and should keep the ques down, and the staff are super friendly, real Amercian customer service.Any fast food fanatic should really try this, you will never be the same again, top quality food on the run. Now go get some and get me a burger whilst your at it.PS they even cater for your dog's, seriously, go check the menu ;)	finally  it s here after sampling a shake in the states about 4 years ago i have yearned to repeat the experience and i got to do that on a invite only taster night we basically sampled the whole menu in bits and pieces and boy are you guys in for a treat some may argue that london doesn t need another a burger joint  i beg to differ  in my eyes meatmarkert was the only decent fast food burger  but with the arrival of shake shake  this changes   yes i would still head to all the other great burger places in london  shake shack is built for speed  grab a burger on the run  a higher class of mcdonald s or burger king if you will the burgers are good  real good  don t expect the burgers to be cooked medium rare all the time  it s a fast food joint  mine had a slight tinge of pink but it didn t really matter  the flavour was awesome  angus beef at it s very best   all three burger s are great in their own right  my personal fav was the shake stack  which is a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese stacked on top of a decelious aberdeen angus patty with all the usual trimmings and when that big ball of deep fried goodness popped my mouth i got a rush of  mushroom and cheesy goodness  really married up with the beef patty  the crinkle cut fries were also very good  good seasoning  crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside  also get the added cheese sauce  really good   pure comfort food   the drinks  you can get pretty much anything  wine  beer  soft drinks and of course milkshakes  now i didn t to sample the milkshakes here but all the food bloggers and fellow foodies around me were raving about them  i on the other hand hit the booze  a shackmeister ale  brewed especially for shake shack by brooklyn brewery  a perfect wing man for any burger  very similar to the brooklyn lager with a subtle difference  very refreshing the layout is good  sit outside in the sun  inside the restaurant or out side in the court yard  you order your food  you get a little vibrating machine  steady on girls  and you get out the way  the machine then buzzes to tell you your food is ready  you collect your food  easy as that  and should keep the ques down  and the staff are super friendly  real amercian customer service any fast food fanatic should really try this  you will never be the same again  top quality food on the run  now go get some and get me a burger whilst your at it ps they even cater for your dog s  seriously  go check the menu

1765	5.0	Love this place, my whole life I've been dreaming on mushrooms in burgers and the shack do this in messy, beautifully delicious style; a portabello mushroom stuff with garlic-herb cheese, breadcrumbed and fried, joins a beef patty in a squishy white (no brioche rubbish) bun and salad, glorious, juicy, tasty, messy, mushroomy goodness, love it so much. The chips here are quite special too, uniquely crinkled cut and crispy, can't get on board with their cheese sauce though. And finally, the only place with milkshakes better than Byron. Why? Because they have malt and because they have a special flavor every week. Yummy in my tummy.	love this place  my whole life i ve been dreaming on mushrooms in burgers and the shack do this in messy  beautifully delicious style  a portabello mushroom stuff with garlic herb cheese  breadcrumbed and fried  joins a beef patty in a squishy white  no brioche rubbish  bun and salad  glorious  juicy  tasty  messy  mushroomy goodness  love it so much  the chips here are quite special too  uniquely crinkled cut and crispy  can t get on board with their cheese sauce though  and finally  the only place with milkshakes better than byron  why  because they have malt and because they have a special flavor every week  yummy in my tummy 
1766	3.0	"Opting to go for the ShackMeister Sausage with crinkle cut fries, ""tangy mayo"" and a water (funnily enough I thought I'd pass on the shake) the only thing that really stood out for me was the quality of the Cumberland pork sausage that lay beneath a bed of cheese sauce and crispy Ale-marinated shallots. The sausage itself was flavoursome and tasty in a lovely soft bun which made an all together pleasant meal while the fries are not anything to brag about. I paid an extra £1 for the tangy mayo which wasn't great and just tasted like burger sauce. I nabbed a taste of my partner's chocolate shake. Again, nothing special here which is pretty ironic given the name of this eatery. So sadly I'd have to agree with some of the previous reviews in that Shake Shack is not a far cry from your standard Mcdonald's type meal. This place is OK for what it is, if not slightly overpriced... Otherwise the customer service was really good- the staff were really helpful and cheerful."	opting to go for the shackmeister sausage with crinkle cut fries   tangy mayo  and a water  funnily enough i thought i d pass on the shake  the only thing that really stood out for me was the quality of the cumberland pork sausage that lay beneath a bed of cheese sauce and crispy ale marinated shallots  the sausage itself was flavoursome and tasty in a lovely soft bun which made an all together pleasant meal while the fries are not anything to brag about  i paid an extra  1 for the tangy mayo which wasn t great and just tasted like burger sauce  i nabbed a taste of my partner s chocolate shake  again  nothing special here which is pretty ironic given the name of this eatery  so sadly i d have to agree with some of the previous reviews in that shake shack is not a far cry from your standard mcdonald s type meal  this place is ok for what it is  if not slightly overpriced    otherwise the customer service was really good  the staff were really helpful and cheerful

Been three times since opening, and wait time has never been less than 20 minutes. There are three different eating areas for those wanting to eat in- one inside to avoid the elements, one outside, and one in the market.	it s the quality that you expect from shake shack  special custards designed for the uk  it s a bit confusing where to order  chaotic  actually  been three times since opening  and wait time has never been less than 20 minutes  there are three different eating areas for those wanting to eat in  one inside to avoid the elements  one outside  and one in the market

Buying in $ is better than £.  Quick service and an outside dining area is great.  Between the USA vs UK Shack shack. I'd say the UK wins.  For some reason my perception is, it tastes less fast food-esk.  Fries cooked well and patty didn't taste microwaved.Great for a quick Friday night meal.Milkshakes taste less creamy from their USA family.  Makes it easier to drink.	first uk shake shack experience after having shack burgers 3 times over two weeks in nyc a few weeks ago  buying in   is better than     quick service and an outside dining area is great   between the usa vs uk shack shack  i d say the uk wins   for some reason my perception is  it tastes less fast food esk   fries cooked well and patty didn t taste microwaved great for a quick friday night meal milkshakes taste less creamy from their usa family   makes it easier to drink 
1773	4.0	Went at 1345 on a Friday. Wait was around 40 mins but I decidedly arrived at the tail end of their lunch peak because the queue only got shorter after me. Arriving before 1230 or after 1430 is probably safe if you don't want to rough it out.I thought it was fairly close to the NY one but just a tiny bit inferior. Then again, I may just be romanticising the nyc one - the grass being always greener and all that.Burger:Patty was as it should be. Flavourful, tender, no complaints. It is of course somewhat small but that's kind of shake shack's thing.Fries:Fries are as average as they are in the states. I only ever get the cheese fries if I get fries, and I only get fries if I'm craving them. Not worth going out of your way for.Drinks:Wanted a root beer float but apparently they were out of rootbeer. Bit annoying. Had a peanut butter milkshake instead. It was too thick for my liking. That's not necesarrily a bad thing, merely a preference. So thick milkshakes basically.Overall:I actually love love love shake shack. I loved it in the states,and I love it here. If you haven't been, ignore the haters and give it a go. For any burger love this is simply one of those that you have to try yourself regardless. I have no doubt I'll be patronising them frequently.Notes:Annoyingly expensive - I was hoping they'd price similar to nyc but they seem to have taken the same prices and just slapped a pound sign in front making everything around 1.5* more expensive. They also seem to have a weird amount of staff. Obviously creating employment is great so it's all well and good but just weird that they have like 20 people milling about doing nothing.	went at 1345 on a friday  wait was around 40 mins but i decidedly arrived at the tail end of their lunch peak because the queue only got shorter after me  arriving before 1230 or after 1430 is probably safe if you don t want to rough it out i thought it was fairly close to the ny one but just a tiny bit inferior  then again  i may just be romanticising the nyc one   the grass being always greener and all that burger patty was as it should be  flavourful  tender  no complaints  it is of course somewhat small but that s kind of shake shack s thing fries fries are as average as they are in the states  i only ever get the cheese fries if i get fries  and i only get fries if i m craving them  not worth going out of your way for drinks wanted a root beer float but apparently they were out of rootbeer  bit annoying  had a peanut butter milkshake instead  it was too thick for my liking  that s not necesarrily a bad thing  merely a preference  so thick milkshakes basically overall i actually love love love shake shack  i loved it in the states and i love it here  if you haven t been  ignore the haters and give it a go  for any burger love this is simply one of those that you have to try yourself regardless  i have no doubt i ll be patronising them frequently notes annoyingly expensive   i was hoping they d price similar to nyc but they seem to have taken the same prices and just slapped a pound sign in front making everything around 1 5  more expensive  they also seem to have a weird amount of staff  obviously creating employment is great so it s all well and good but just weird that they have like 20 people milling about doing nothing 
1774	3.0	"In a nutshell: a lot of swing but not that great a punch. Apparently Shake Shack is one of the most successful, popular and applauded burger chains in the US which explains all the hype about its arrival to London. After all, this is the country that also gave us McDonalds and Burger King and I sure as hell think those are brilliant ideas in their own right. (There might be some sarcasm in the above sentence, but I will leave that open to interpretation)Here's the thing: you can't really call yourself a ""fast food"" chain and then take 40 minutes to serve your clients. I mean, there's nothing wrong with taking 40 minutes to serve your clients if you are cooking something on the spot. Like a duck. That just got captured. Bistro-style dish in Marsala jus.But then you should drop the ""fast"" from the ""fast food"" concept and just go with ""food"" when you are positioning your brand. ""Food"" on its own sounds weird though... I suggest ""Good Food"" in lack of a better idea.Oh and it also doesn't help that a meal (with a milkshake included) costs 3 times more than your normal ""fast food"" meal. You see... time and price go hand in hand when it comes to FF (I am just gonna type FF for Fast Food cause the expression is getting on my nerves...)Still with me? Here's where it gets even trickier: the burger was actually nice. Well cooked, flavorful, good amount of salad... But it was small!!! Heaps small for the price! And they brought my milkshake in the wrong flavor (vanilla instead of strawberry) - it's alright, I can forgive the confusion. What I can't forgive is that the milkshake was thick to the point that I doubt it was blended for more than 2 seconds. [Insert sad face here]. Even for FF standards, this is disappointing. The crinkled fries are absolutely great. Loved them. It's like they perfectly cut them to bite size bits. For that and because the burger had a nice flavor to it I am giving it a 3 rather than dropping it straight to the lower league.One thing is for sure: on any given Sunday and for this price range I would definitely recommend Byron instead. The gap between the two is just too big to compare."	in a nutshell  a lot of swing but not that great a punch  apparently shake shack is one of the most successful  popular and applauded burger chains in the us which explains all the hype about its arrival to london  after all  this is the country that also gave us mcdonalds and burger king and i sure as hell think those are brilliant ideas in their own right   there might be some sarcasm in the above sentence  but i will leave that open to interpretation here s the thing  you can t really call yourself a  fast food  chain and then take 40 minutes to serve your clients  i mean  there s nothing wrong with taking 40 minutes to serve your clients if you are cooking something on the spot  like a duck  that just got captured  bistro style dish in marsala jus but then you should drop the  fast  from the  fast food  concept and just go with  food  when you are positioning your brand   food  on its own sounds weird though    i suggest  good food  in lack of a better idea oh and it also doesn t help that a meal  with a milkshake included  costs 3 times more than your normal  fast food  meal  you see    time and price go hand in hand when it comes to ff  i am just gonna type ff for fast food cause the expression is getting on my nerves    still with me  here s where it gets even trickier  the burger was actually nice  well cooked  flavorful  good amount of salad    but it was small    heaps small for the price  and they brought my milkshake in the wrong flavor  vanilla instead of strawberry    it s alright  i can forgive the confusion  what i can t forgive is that the milkshake was thick to the point that i doubt it was blended for more than 2 seconds   insert sad face here   even for ff standards  this is disappointing  the crinkled fries are absolutely great  loved them  it s like they perfectly cut them to bite size bits  for that and because the burger had a nice flavor to it i am giving it a 3 rather than dropping it straight to the lower league one thing is for sure  on any given sunday and for this price range i would definitely recommend byron instead  the gap between the two is just too big to compare 
1775	3.0	Ordered: Shack Stack with fries.Price: circa £10-11Review: Truly a burger with finesse yet fast food. The sinking of your teeth let alone can make you fall in love with this burger joint. Having eaten in both NY and LDN for this burger - it just goes to show how much of an impact this burger has had on my burger radar - completely thrown me off to be honest! The downside - the price is a little steep - they have converted the USD pricing to GBP - ie making it about 1.5 times more expensive than in the US, but I would not go back until I really need the urge for a burger as I have been once too many times I think :) Happy eating :)	ordered  shack stack with fries price  circa  10 11review  truly a burger with finesse yet fast food  the sinking of your teeth let alone can make you fall in love with this burger joint  having eaten in both ny and ldn for this burger   it just goes to show how much of an impact this burger has had on my burger radar   completely thrown me off to be honest  the downside   the price is a little steep   they have converted the usd pricing to gbp   ie making it about 1 5 times more expensive than in the us  but i would not go back until i really need the urge for a burger as i have been once too many times i think    happy eating

There wasn't enough cheese on the fries to call them cheesy fries & the burger was smaller then a eurodeal from McDonald's! But at the end our waiter was extremely friendly and serves us with a great smile!

1777	2.0	"Having recently reviewed the ""small group of blokes"" burger offering around the corner thought it only fair that I do the same for Shake Shack.First thing to note is despite the very central location in Covent Garden this place doesn't scream out ""HERE WE ARE!"" I'm wondering if that was a stipulation on taking the lease or if that's a Shake Shack thing but have to say for an American burger chain its refreshing.Just outside the main door a Shack employee handed me a menu despite there being a huge one plastered all over the back wall..... go figure!First thing to note was the complete lack of a plain burger option it was all variations on a cheese burgers or ""burger off"" so to speak. I guess you could have ordered your burger without cheese but I doubt they'd have adjusted the price accordingly.... odd really.While in line waiting to order it was impossible not to notice the huge number of employees behind the counter. A quick count came to over 20. I doubt the actual figure was under 25!! What the hell is this a Government led employment scheme??? Decided to go for a single patty cheese burger at £4.75 as the double for £7.75 was like £7.75.... are you serious????? As usual I had the ""mayonnaise"" left out as as I've previously said I hate slop. Ended up getting the mandatory do you want fries?, do you want a drink? etc etc which was No, No and No! Got handed a cool beepy, buzzy thingy to alert me as to when my order was ready. Again as with the competition around the corner you couldn't describe this as fast food despite the number of employees the wait was in the minutes rather than the sub-minute you'd expect at McD's. I'll give Shake Shack its due its one of the visually prettiest burgers I've seen for quite some time (see my uploaded photo) unfortunately I was also taken by its rather demure size considering its just 5 pence short of 5 quid!The bread? in the bun comes from the 'Wonder Bread' school of bakery rather than anything a baker would recognise as bread. My kingdom, my kingdom for a burger on a real bread bun! Picking the burger up I noticed that the bun was hinged and not 2 separate pieces i.e. a top and bottom which led to the observation that the filling only covered the front 2/3rds of the burger. Think your average supermarket sandwich thats super stuffed with filling on the side you can see but on purchase you see that the bit you can't is filling free. One of my pet hates with any food is widely varying temperatures. Yet again a supposedly premium American burger chain is selling its burgers with hot meat and fridge cold tomato, lettuce etc. If McD's can get this right when selling a burger at a 3rd the price it fails me my Shake Shack and others can't.Overall the actual items in the burger (temperature excepted) were quite good. The tomato was ripe and the pickles nicely sharp and crunchy but as mentioned above I'd have preferred them to have covered the entire burger.The Shake Shack literature says that burgers are cooked medium unless asked otherwise. I didn't say anything but wonder if I got medium? (see my attached photo) The beef is 100% Aberdeen Angus but didn't specifically note the meat being anything special if anything it had quite a mushy if I was being nice or ""pre-chewed"" if I wasn't texture. The bottom of the burger was completely sodden and my fingers felt quite fatty after finishing the burger.Overall given the choice I'd choose Shake Shake over its rival around the corner but thats not to say that Its a great burger."	having recently reviewed the  small group of blokes  burger offering around the corner thought it only fair that i do the same for shake shack first thing to note is despite the very central location in covent garden this place doesn t scream out  here we are   i m wondering if that was a stipulation on taking the lease or if that s a shake shack thing but have to say for an american burger chain its refreshing just outside the main door a shack employee handed me a menu despite there being a huge one plastered all over the back wall      go figure first thing to note was the complete lack of a plain burger option it was all variations on a cheese burgers or  burger off  so to speak  i guess you could have ordered your burger without cheese but i doubt they d have adjusted the price accordingly     odd really while in line waiting to order it was impossible not to notice the huge number of employees behind the counter  a quick count came to over 20  i doubt the actual figure was under 25   what the hell is this a government led employment scheme    decided to go for a single patty cheese burger at  4 75 as the double for  7 75 was like  7 75     are you serious      as usual i had the  mayonnaise  left out as as i ve previously said i hate slop  ended up getting the mandatory do you want fries   do you want a drink  etc etc which was no  no and no  got handed a cool beepy  buzzy thingy to alert me as to when my order was ready  again as with the competition around the corner you couldn t describe this as fast food despite the number of employees the wait was in the minutes rather than the sub minute you d expect at mcd s  i ll give shake shack its due its one of the visually prettiest burgers i ve seen for quite some time  see my uploaded photo  unfortunately i was also taken by its rather demure size considering its just 5 pence short of 5 quid the bread  in the bun comes from the  wonder bread  school of bakery rather than anything a baker would recognise as bread  my kingdom  my kingdom for a burger on a real bread bun  picking the burger up i noticed that the bun was hinged and not 2 separate pieces i e  a top and bottom which led to the observation that the filling only covered the front 2 3rds of the burger  think your average supermarket sandwich thats super stuffed with filling on the side you can see but on purchase you see that the bit you can t is filling free  one of my pet hates with any food is widely varying temperatures  yet again a supposedly premium american burger chain is selling its burgers with hot meat and fridge cold tomato  lettuce etc  if mcd s can get this right when selling a burger at a 3rd the price it fails me my shake shack and others can t overall the actual items in the burger  temperature excepted  were quite good  the tomato was ripe and the pickles nicely sharp and crunchy but as mentioned above i d have preferred them to have covered the entire burger the shake shack literature says that burgers are cooked medium unless asked otherwise  i didn t say anything but wonder if i got medium   see my attached photo  the beef is 100  aberdeen angus but didn t specifically note the meat being anything special if anything it had quite a mushy if i was being nice or  pre chewed  if i wasn t texture  the bottom of the burger was completely sodden and my fingers felt quite fatty after finishing the burger overall given the choice i d choose shake shake over its rival around the corner but thats not to say that its a great burger

1779	3.0	I used to live off Shake Shack when I lived in New York as it was a substantial well made meal for a great price. I was excited when Shake Shack came to London, however my first full meal came to around £15. Not nearly as affordable as the NY version. The first couple of months it tasted fresh and great. Since then there's been a slow decline in the quality of the food here, now it's a fancier version of McDonalds. I still come here from time to time, when I'm in a rush and want something quick, but it's far from what it used to be.	i used to live off shake shack when i lived in new york as it was a substantial well made meal for a great price  i was excited when shake shack came to london  however my first full meal came to around  15  not nearly as affordable as the ny version  the first couple of months it tasted fresh and great  since then there s been a slow decline in the quality of the food here  now it s a fancier version of mcdonalds  i still come here from time to time  when i m in a rush and want something quick  but it s far from what it used to be

There are employees everywhere to keep the whole process from order to departure running smooth. The line system is well set up, and while I didn't like the snippy cashier who refused to let us order medium rare (easy at SS in the states) it's all-in-all a breeze.If you've never been, it doesn't get much better than a ShackBurger, fries and a Fair Shake. The latter being the greatest coffee shake on the planet. Hell, the greatest shake PERIOD. The fries at this location were also bringing their A-game; I've had a variety of fry conditions at other shacks, from burnt to soggy, but these were crispy and delicious.But what's with everyone putting so much damn mayo on their burgers? There's a pile of mayo dipping cups in the seating area, and practically every table had crazed hooligans ladling it on by the knife-full with each bite.The Shack sauce is all you need, friends.	shake shack or five guys  how do you pick your favorite child in a nutshell  this location is about as perfect as can be  there are employees everywhere to keep the whole process from order to departure running smooth  the line system is well set up  and while i didn t like the snippy cashier who refused to let us order medium rare  easy at ss in the states  it s all in all a breeze if you ve never been  it doesn t get much better than a shackburger  fries and a fair shake  the latter being the greatest coffee shake on the planet  hell  the greatest shake period  the fries at this location were also bringing their a game  i ve had a variety of fry conditions at other shacks  from burnt to soggy  but these were crispy and delicious but what s with everyone putting so much damn mayo on their burgers  there s a pile of mayo dipping cups in the seating area  and practically every table had crazed hooligans ladling it on by the knife full with each bite the shack sauce is all you need  friends 
1781	5.0	After going to Shake Shack in NY 6 months ago I had been craving a great burger since moving to London.. to my delight I head the news of Shake Shack opening in Covent Garden and just had to go! Being the third day open I expected a huge queue, but due to the efficient staff I was at the front of the line within minutes and not long after holding the perfectly sculpted 'shroom' burger & equally delicious toffee flavored 'concrete' shake. Both were amazing which is slightly sad because now it's going to take a lot of will power to not go here everyday for this breathtaking experience!	after going to shake shack in ny 6 months ago i had been craving a great burger since moving to london   to my delight i head the news of shake shack opening in covent garden and just had to go  being the third day open i expected a huge queue  but due to the efficient staff i was at the front of the line within minutes and not long after holding the perfectly sculpted  shroom  burger   equally delicious toffee flavored  concrete  shake  both were amazing which is slightly sad because now it s going to take a lot of will power to not go here everyday for this breathtaking experience

You really don't feel like you're eating fast food with the great customer service in the way they take your order and wipe down your table if you are eating in.I got the blackberry buttermilk custard (that day's special!) and the shack stack. BEST DECISION EVER. Definitely try the custard! It's thick, creamy, but not overwhelmingly heavy. Shack stack was also spectacular.One small thumbs down is the fact that they messed up my burger and got me a regular shack burger. I went up to the counter to get my correct order and they did apologize, but it took a long time for them to put the mushroom inside, and while I waited, the custard just sat on the counter getting slightly melted.I'm from the States, but only the East Coast has them.

Both had cheese burgers and chips! Then at the airport on the way home got the worst macdonalds only to realise as we went round to our gate there was a shake shack... Duh! Soo we got a chocolate concrete which was sooo good.I've seen the shake shack in CG and not alwaaaays with a massive queue but have been trying to visit as many of my other restaurants on my long list as possible so hadn't been until a few weeks ago when we were rushing to a comedy night starving hungry and saw there wasn't a queueI got the same as I did in NY, cheese burger, then shared choco concrete and chips with bf and still loooooved it!

1787	2.0	I came here with my husband who was craving a burger. He thought it was decent, but, I don't know. What you got for the price was absolutely ridiculous. Now onto the review from a non-meat eater's perspective. I am a pescetarian who hates, ABHORS mushrooms, and I know of several others (including vegetarians) who feel the same. The only vegetarian option Shake Shack offers is the shroom burger, though, apparently because (according to a Buzzfeed article) that was the only thing they could come up that people would actually crave. It's a bit of a shame because I have had several delicious veggie burgers (mainly from USA) and think that people do crave other vegetarian ingredients!So I just had their chips. They're yummy, but they taste like they're good quality chips you can find in the frozen food aisle, not freshly, hand-cut and deep fried like proper fries/chips!Two stars for the OK chips and my husband's word that the burger was ok.	i came here with my husband who was craving a burger  he thought it was decent  but  i don t know  what you got for the price was absolutely ridiculous  now onto the review from a non meat eater s perspective  i am a pescetarian who hates  abhors mushrooms  and i know of several others  including vegetarians  who feel the same  the only vegetarian option shake shack offers is the shroom burger  though  apparently because  according to a buzzfeed article  that was the only thing they could come up that people would actually crave  it s a bit of a shame because i have had several delicious veggie burgers  mainly from usa  and think that people do crave other vegetarian ingredients so i just had their chips  they re yummy  but they taste like they re good quality chips you can find in the frozen food aisle  not freshly  hand cut and deep fried like proper fries chips two stars for the ok chips and my husband s word that the burger was ok 
1788	4.0	Ah, yet another high profile New York import. It isn't as good as the original (obviously) but it really ain't half bad!Popped by a little past opening time (11am) on a Saturday being the over-eager azns we are and poof, no queue! Fair enough, I'm like a whole month late on this but still, on Saturday at a massive tourist hot spot, *AMAZING*. Service was quick, friendly, and we went off to sit on their surprisingly nice ikea garden chairs (of the TÄRNÖ variety).My favourite shroom burger is still a winner! The first time I had it (at Union Square) I didn't even realise it was vegetarian - that's how good it is! And it pretty much tastes the same here (massive thumbs up). 'Melted cheese' is hardly an accurate description. This cheese is warm and gooey and stretches as you try to pull the burger away from your mouth but the best bit (!!!!) is how good it tastes. Seriously. I don't know what they season it with but it makes the burger. That and the mushroom's crispy outside are perfection. Their super skinny crinkle cut fries are also ace (perfect soft to crispy bits ratio, come onnnnn!) and their milkshakes are pretty good (if you can finish them. Burgers are small-ish, on the other hand).So yes, we like Shake Shack in the UK because it's pretty darn good and reliable but... someone always screws up somewhere. Here it's their buns! (Which is really unfortunate because it's meant to be their 'thing').In the states they're soft, fluffy, almost sweet and a little brioche-like (nomzzzz). These just miss the mark ever-so-slightly, which is cool except that when you eat the bun on its own, you notice that the outside has a weird 'skin' that's a little dry and sticks to your teeth. I swear it's something in London's nasty hard water.On the bright side, you probably won't be having the bun on its own anyway so despite my bun gripes, they're pretty decent above-average-chain-place-type burgers.	ah  yet another high profile new york import  it isn t as good as the original  obviously  but it really ain t half bad popped by a little past opening time  11am  on a saturday being the over eager azns we are and poof  no queue  fair enough  i m like a whole month late on this but still  on saturday at a massive tourist hot spot   amazing   service was quick  friendly  and we went off to sit on their surprisingly nice ikea garden chairs  of the t rn  variety  my favourite shroom burger is still a winner  the first time i had it  at union square  i didn t even realise it was vegetarian   that s how good it is  and it pretty much tastes the same here  massive thumbs up    melted cheese  is hardly an accurate description  this cheese is warm and gooey and stretches as you try to pull the burger away from your mouth but the best bit        is how good it tastes  seriously  i don t know what they season it with but it makes the burger  that and the mushroom s crispy outside are perfection  their super skinny crinkle cut fries are also ace  perfect soft to crispy bits ratio  come onnnnn   and their milkshakes are pretty good  if you can finish them  burgers are small ish  on the other hand  so yes  we like shake shack in the uk because it s pretty darn good and reliable but    someone always screws up somewhere  here it s their buns   which is really unfortunate because it s meant to be their  thing   in the states they re soft  fluffy  almost sweet and a little brioche like  nomzzzz   these just miss the mark ever so slightly  which is cool except that when you eat the bun on its own  you notice that the outside has a weird  skin  that s a little dry and sticks to your teeth  i swear it s something in london s nasty hard water on the bright side  you probably won t be having the bun on its own anyway so despite my bun gripes  they re pretty decent above average chain place type burgers

I don't usually welcome tomato in my burgers but thoroughly enjoyed the slice in my double Shack burger. The cheese had to be the best thing (besides the bun) about the burger. Not too sure which kind it was but it complimented the beef patties perfectly!The Milkshake was on point - I stuck to my usual and went for the Peanut Butter kind (although thinking back I wish I would have been more adventurous and gone for something slightly different).I will definitely put this on my regular spot list, I just have to try out Five Guys first.Get down there already...!	the burger fever has hit an all time high in london again      one word  wowzers tescos  waitrose  sainsburys and asda all need to invest in these potato bread rolls  they re like pillows of breaddy goodness     i m in love the shake shack burger tasted like a true old school burger  no silly condiments or anything marinating in odd flavour mash ups just a good ol  regular burger  i don t usually welcome tomato in my burgers but thoroughly enjoyed the slice in my double shack burger  the cheese had to be the best thing  besides the bun  about the burger  not too sure which kind it was but it complimented the beef patties perfectly the milkshake was on point   i stuck to my usual and went for the peanut butter kind  although thinking back i wish i would have been more adventurous and gone for something slightly different  i will definitely put this on my regular spot list  i just have to try out five guys first get down there already    
1790	3.0	I am not a huge fan of the burgers as feel they're too soft and the fries aren't evocative of actual freshly cut potatoes, but what concerns me most are the pigeons in the market and their proximity to diners.

I couldn't relax and as much as I wanted to enjoy my meal, all I could think about is when I could get outta that coup.Without the pigeons, would return but until an aggressive birth control/death policy is in place, you won't find me at Shake Shack London.	i am not a huge fan of the burgers as feel they re too soft and the fries aren t evocative of actual freshly cut potatoes  but what concerns me most are the pigeons in the market and their proximity to diners  i was shooing away a footless winged beast my entire meal  i couldn t relax and as much as i wanted to enjoy my meal  all i could think about is when i could get outta that coup without the pigeons  would return but until an aggressive birth control death policy is in place  you won t find me at shake shack london 
1791	3.0	I've waited a while to give Shake Shack a try, mostly because I refused to stand in a queue that wrapped half-way through Covent Garden, but the hype has now died down enough to grab a burger.I wasn't disappointed with Shake Shack, but I am definitely glad I never stood in that crazy queue to get it.It kind of tastes like a Hungry Jacks burger (the Australian version of Burger King) - their slogan has something to do with flame-grilled patties and I'm not sure if that's how Shake Shack cook their burgers but if so, I'd like a prize for my palate. Dave A. went with me and he loved it for this exact reason, his Australian food request is always a Bacon Deluxe burger from Hungry Jacks, which no one has quite figured out to put into a care package just yet.The biggest disappointment for me was the sauce. If you name a sauce after your brand I want it to really stand out, but I didn't even really notice it was there...Other than the burger I got a peanut butter shake and we split a serve of the fries. I probably wouldn't recommend the peanut butter flavour, but the shake itself was awesome. So thick I could barely get it up the straw, my kind of shake. The serving of fries is pretty small so if you're hungry, go for one each.	i ve waited a while to give shake shack a try  mostly because i refused to stand in a queue that wrapped half way through covent garden  but the hype has now died down enough to grab a burger i wasn t disappointed with shake shack  but i am definitely glad i never stood in that crazy queue to get it it kind of tastes like a hungry jacks burger  the australian version of burger king    their slogan has something to do with flame grilled patties and i m not sure if that s how shake shack cook their burgers but if so  i d like a prize for my palate  dave a  went with me and he loved it for this exact reason  his australian food request is always a bacon deluxe burger from hungry jacks  which no one has quite figured out to put into a care package just yet the biggest disappointment for me was the sauce  if you name a sauce after your brand i want it to really stand out  but i didn t even really notice it was there   other than the burger i got a peanut butter shake and we split a serve of the fries  i probably wouldn t recommend the peanut butter flavour  but the shake itself was awesome  so thick i could barely get it up the straw  my kind of shake  the serving of fries is pretty small so if you re hungry  go for one each

1793	4.0	While the appearance may resemble that of a McDonalds cheeseburger the taste of the burger was far superior with a really well seasoned patty cooked to perfection and smothered in cheese. I chose to have raw onions in mine as well, yum! Like Bleeker Street, ShakeShack also have their own special sauce which I opted not to have as I'm really not a fan of anything more than cheese on my burger. The crinkle cut chips were also really good which is always a surprise to me as I'm not a fan of chips in general.My friend and I chose to share a large fresh lemonade instead of one of the signature shakes which we both agreed was totally amazing. The rest of the prices seemed to be on par with other burger joints in London and this was definitely the best I've tasted recently.	while the appearance may resemble that of a mcdonalds cheeseburger the taste of the burger was far superior with a really well seasoned patty cooked to perfection and smothered in cheese  i chose to have raw onions in mine as well  yum  like bleeker street  shakeshack also have their own special sauce which i opted not to have as i m really not a fan of anything more than cheese on my burger  the crinkle cut chips were also really good which is always a surprise to me as i m not a fan of chips in general my friend and i chose to share a large fresh lemonade instead of one of the signature shakes which we both agreed was totally amazing  the rest of the prices seemed to be on par with other burger joints in london and this was definitely the best i ve tasted recently 
1794	3.0	I previously lived in proximity to NYC when living in the states so I had the authentic shake shack burger and fries/shake. I came here in order to try the same in London! The service was good for the large amount of people waiting for the food and the food was good. Not great or spectacular, just good. The burger was nice but a little salty; the fries were great, and the shake was pretty good! If your a native New Yorker coming here you will probably have a similar view to me, but if not this was a great establishment!	i previously lived in proximity to nyc when living in the states so i had the authentic shake shack burger and fries shake  i came here in order to try the same in london  the service was good for the large amount of people waiting for the food and the food was good  not great or spectacular  just good  the burger was nice but a little salty  the fries were great  and the shake was pretty good  if your a native new yorker coming here you will probably have a similar view to me  but if not this was a great establishment 
1795	3.0	Very decent place, reminds me of NYC's Shake Shack, duh...Like NYC's locations, it has quite a queue. Luckily, it goes rather quickly, even at the busy times despite the daunting length - a far cry to the Shake Shack location at Madison Square Garden, which took forever to move. Thank (whatever god you believe in) its closed!And just like the NYC's locations, the burgers were tasty and good, and a bit sloppy too. Regardless, the ground beef tastes the same, the toppings too, and chips were about the same as well - wow, its almost like McDonald's, as in consistency.Treats are also available here if you have wolfie along with you.I've ordered takeaway, and was provided a good container to haul the food - did me fine when going home with it, though the other transport patron probably didn't appreciate it, I'm sure, hee hee.Will come back for more!	very decent place  reminds me of nyc s shake shack  duh   like nyc s locations  it has quite a queue  luckily  it goes rather quickly  even at the busy times despite the daunting length   a far cry to the shake shack location at madison square garden  which took forever to move  thank  whatever god you believe in  its closed and just like the nyc s locations  the burgers were tasty and good  and a bit sloppy too  regardless  the ground beef tastes the same  the toppings too  and chips were about the same as well   wow  its almost like mcdonald s  as in consistency treats are also available here if you have wolfie along with you i ve ordered takeaway  and was provided a good container to haul the food   did me fine when going home with it  though the other transport patron probably didn t appreciate it  i m sure  hee hee will come back for more 
1796	3.0	I'd love to know what the big deal is about Shake Shack. I get the feeling it's a nostalgia thing for the Yelpers from America. Perhaps it feels like a little slice of home in their new home.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my burger, but I was not wowed by it.Let's start with the location. They're right in the middle of Covent Garden Market. There's outdoor seating within the market building and an indoors area (which I totally missed until I was already seated outside because it's not in the same room as the counters. Tables seemed to be mostly created for groups of four, but despite no real queues, we struggled to find a table because all tables were taken by couples. In the middle of Winter I'm disappointed that they have no heaters in the outdoor area. It was really cold and by the end of eating my burger my fingers were purple.The ordering/serving system doesn't really make sense to me. You order and pay at the counter. The staff who served me was really nice. It was a nice surprise to be asked how I was. I'm used to just asking for my order. After ordering you are handed a buzzer/bleeper with your receipt and head to find a table. When the buzzer goes off you go back to the serving hatch by the counter to collect your food. Why so complicated?I guess the important thing is the food. I'd be warned about the small burgers so order the Shack Stack - a beef patty, breaded portobello mushroom, lettuce, tomato. It was really nice, the mushroom really made the burger. My friends stuck with more classic cheese burgers and both seemed a bit disappointed by not only how small it was, but how thin it was too. The chips were awesome. Really crispy. I'd go back just for them to be honest. Perhaps the problem with Shake Shack is the price. It's got the set up of a McDonalds, but with the prices of Byron and the other premium joints. For this reason I'd rather go to one of the MeatLiquer or Byron restaurants next time, unless I return for the chips and to try the custard.	i d love to know what the big deal is about shake shack  i get the feeling it s a nostalgia thing for the yelpers from america  perhaps it feels like a little slice of home in their new home don t get me wrong  i enjoyed my burger  but i was not wowed by it let s start with the location  they re right in the middle of covent garden market  there s outdoor seating within the market building and an indoors area  which i totally missed until i was already seated outside because it s not in the same room as the counters  tables seemed to be mostly created for groups of four  but despite no real queues  we struggled to find a table because all tables were taken by couples  in the middle of winter i m disappointed that they have no heaters in the outdoor area  it was really cold and by the end of eating my burger my fingers were purple the ordering serving system doesn t really make sense to me  you order and pay at the counter  the staff who served me was really nice  it was a nice surprise to be asked how i was  i m used to just asking for my order  after ordering you are handed a buzzer bleeper with your receipt and head to find a table  when the buzzer goes off you go back to the serving hatch by the counter to collect your food  why so complicated i guess the important thing is the food  i d be warned about the small burgers so order the shack stack   a beef patty  breaded portobello mushroom  lettuce  tomato  it was really nice  the mushroom really made the burger  my friends stuck with more classic cheese burgers and both seemed a bit disappointed by not only how small it was  but how thin it was too  the chips were awesome  really crispy  i d go back just for them to be honest  perhaps the problem with shake shack is the price  it s got the set up of a mcdonalds  but with the prices of byron and the other premium joints  for this reason i d rather go to one of the meatliquer or byron restaurants next time  unless i return for the chips and to try the custard 
1797	4.0	"It is slightly embarrassing for me to admit how many times I've been here this year... As a New York transplant, Shake Shack will always have a special place in my heart. I've had many long conversations with college friends while eating Shake Shack in the park and people-watching. Bit harder to do that here, but one thing that I really appreciate about London Shake Shack is that, unlike some American imports (looking at you Chipotle), it tastes EXACTLY the same as back home. Objectively, this isn't the best burger in London by any means. But it is, and always will be, comfort food. It bugs me though that the ""cost"" is the same until you see the £ and not the $ :("	it is slightly embarrassing for me to admit how many times i ve been here this year    as a new york transplant  shake shack will always have a special place in my heart  i ve had many long conversations with college friends while eating shake shack in the park and people watching  bit harder to do that here  but one thing that i really appreciate about london shake shack is that  unlike some american imports  looking at you chipotle   it tastes exactly the same as back home  objectively  this isn t the best burger in london by any means  but it is  and always will be  comfort food  it bugs me though that the  cost  is the same until you see the   and not the

This time, I tried the sticky toffee and another one that had strawberry jam in it (can't remember the name). It took them probably 20 minutes to make two concretes and when they were finally ready, the person at the counter gave us a third, on the house, for making us wait. That was great!	i ve been to this location several times now and they always make the most delicious concretes  this time  i tried the sticky toffee and another one that had strawberry jam in it  can t remember the name   it took them probably 20 minutes to make two concretes and when they were finally ready  the person at the counter gave us a third  on the house  for making us wait  that was great

Avoid.	burgers  tiny  buns  squished doughy white  fries  cold  price  high  to be expected in covent garden  but would expect halfway decent quality  shake was somewhat redeeming  avoid 
1800	2.0	After opening five months ago, I finally rolled up into Shake Shack to give them a try. I'm always curious, and being from the west coast in the US, this was my first opportunity to give them a try. But I'm not going to queue for ages for a burger. Not going to happen. Sorry. Luckily in December the queue is down to a minimum. There were things I really liked about Shake Shack. First the fries are pretty awesome. Super crispy fries. The cheese sauce is like you'd expect it to be for an American franchise: oozy, warm and orange. They even have unsweetened ice tea. It's like being back home.There were things that were nice, but not amazing. The concrete was nice. I think mine had about four fillings. It was nice, with the best part probably being the biscuits and the peanut butter. But it wasn't any better than some of the Gelato and Ice Cream places around London.And finally there were bad things. The burger. It was kind of boring to be honest. I went with the Shake Stack (because I love mushrooms on my burger) and opted to add bacon and the chopped pepper from the Smoke Stack. I figured this was likely to be my only trip here and I might as well go for it. Nothing was really great for me. I mean it was an adequate burger, but I don't want adequate burgers. I want something awesome. Especially when my total was over £20. Yup. For a fast food burger, fries, drink and a dessert, it was over £20. There is no way I can justify spending that much money on fast food ever again. Especially when it wasn't amazing. Oh and the outdoor seating. There were heat lamps, but they weren't doing anything. And it's December and cold. Not cool Shake Shack.There are better fast food burgers quite close by, and if you could mix those with the fries from Shake Shack, I think I'd be in heaven. At least for fast food. Although again, most of the food trucks around London do a better job with burgers. I really can't imagine ever going back here.	after opening five months ago  i finally rolled up into shake shack to give them a try  i m always curious  and being from the west coast in the us  this was my first opportunity to give them a try  but i m not going to queue for ages for a burger  not going to happen  sorry  luckily in december the queue is down to a minimum  there were things i really liked about shake shack  first the fries are pretty awesome  super crispy fries  the cheese sauce is like you d expect it to be for an american franchise  oozy  warm and orange  they even have unsweetened ice tea  it s like being back home there were things that were nice  but not amazing  the concrete was nice  i think mine had about four fillings  it was nice  with the best part probably being the biscuits and the peanut butter  but it wasn t any better than some of the gelato and ice cream places around london and finally there were bad things  the burger  it was kind of boring to be honest  i went with the shake stack  because i love mushrooms on my burger  and opted to add bacon and the chopped pepper from the smoke stack  i figured this was likely to be my only trip here and i might as well go for it  nothing was really great for me  i mean it was an adequate burger  but i don t want adequate burgers  i want something awesome  especially when my total was over  20  yup  for a fast food burger  fries  drink and a dessert  it was over  20  there is no way i can justify spending that much money on fast food ever again  especially when it wasn t amazing  oh and the outdoor seating  there were heat lamps  but they weren t doing anything  and it s december and cold  not cool shake shack there are better fast food burgers quite close by  and if you could mix those with the fries from shake shack  i think i d be in heaven  at least for fast food  although again  most of the food trucks around london do a better job with burgers  i really can t imagine ever going back here 
1801	1.0	Very disappointing.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was incredibly greasy.  Bun was a bit soppy and overall the burger was not very tasty.  It was £5, but I would much rather spend a bit more and get a cheeseburger at the Diner or Byron.The greeter was very funny and outgoing, the man who took our order was super unfriendly.  Runners who take your food to your table were polite.I have some big annoyances about this place.  Their menu is limited but I think they do so much of it poorly.  The cheesy chips aren't crispy, the burger was soppy with grease and when the food comes to you there are no napkins.  Honestly, I was even disappointed by their fizzy water (flat).  The whole thing was a let down.I would be willing to come back to try their hot dogs and shakes, but their burger is a total miss.	very disappointing   i ordered a cheeseburger and it was incredibly greasy   bun was a bit soppy and overall the burger was not very tasty   it was  5  but i would much rather spend a bit more and get a cheeseburger at the diner or byron the greeter was very funny and outgoing  the man who took our order was super unfriendly   runners who take your food to your table were polite i have some big annoyances about this place   their menu is limited but i think they do so much of it poorly   the cheesy chips aren t crispy  the burger was soppy with grease and when the food comes to you there are no napkins   honestly  i was even disappointed by their fizzy water  flat    the whole thing was a let down i would be willing to come back to try their hot dogs and shakes  but their burger is a total miss

1804	3.0	I don't get it. People seem to be rather obsessed by this brand.I mean, the burgers are nice. But they're not THAT nice. Are they? Am I missing something?They're a little simple. (Not simple as in The Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz, but simple like a glass of milk.) Burger, bun, lettuce, tomato. Alright so they probably argue that they're all made out of amazing ingredients, which means you don't need no fanciness, which, granted, is true. BUT I think this trend is a little conveeeniant for those (dare I say it!) lazzyy chefs and restaurants out there. Maybe I'm being cynical. Either way, although the meat for the burger was clearly good meat, it was greasy and didn't leave me feeling fantastic. This is actually the second time I've eaten in Shake Shack, and have had the same experience both times.Anyway, I think it's grand. Just grand. Nothing more, nothing less my friends.

1805	2.0	So much hype!Boy was I disappointed with this place. People have been raving about this place for quite some time, so I figured that I owed myself a trip here to see what it is all about.Opting to come here a little later on in the evening, to therefore escape the unfeasibly large queues, I only had to wait for around 20 min to place my order. What a luxury!After placing my order, I milled around the pickup window and waited for my food and drink. After another really long wait (bearing in mind that it was a very atypically quiet time for Shake Shack) I was presented with my order.Firstly, the claims of the holy grail of milkshakes was unfounded. My friend's shakes that I tried and also my own that I ordered were all nice enough but in no way did they justify the astronomical price tag. The fries were merely average (they tasted like  something you get in the frozen section of the grocery store) and the burger was indeed pretty good, but far from the best I have ever tasted.I suppose that many of these things are very subjective. However, I went to this place with a very open mind and was really hoping and I daresay excited at the prospect of something new and compelling to experience in London. In short I have had better burgers many times in my life, I have most definitely had better fries and/or chips and most importantly (if you are going to name your business after them) I have had way better milkshakes in my time. And all of these have been far cheaper than the prices Shake Shack charge. Some of my American friends have told me that they pretty much took the dollar price and changed it to a £. If this is true, the review would be far more positive in line with value for money, and indeed why am I being prejudiced against that I am paying 50% more for my food just because I am British?	so much hype boy was i disappointed with this place  people have been raving about this place for quite some time  so i figured that i owed myself a trip here to see what it is all about opting to come here a little later on in the evening  to therefore escape the unfeasibly large queues  i only had to wait for around 20 min to place my order  what a luxury after placing my order  i milled around the pickup window and waited for my food and drink  after another really long wait  bearing in mind that it was a very atypically quiet time for shake shack  i was presented with my order firstly  the claims of the holy grail of milkshakes was unfounded  my friend s shakes that i tried and also my own that i ordered were all nice enough but in no way did they justify the astronomical price tag  the fries were merely average  they tasted like  something you get in the frozen section of the grocery store  and the burger was indeed pretty good  but far from the best i have ever tasted i suppose that many of these things are very subjective  however  i went to this place with a very open mind and was really hoping and i daresay excited at the prospect of something new and compelling to experience in london  in short i have had better burgers many times in my life  i have most definitely had better fries and or chips and most importantly  if you are going to name your business after them  i have had way better milkshakes in my time  and all of these have been far cheaper than the prices shake shack charge  some of my american friends have told me that they pretty much took the dollar price and changed it to a    if this is true  the review would be far more positive in line with value for money  and indeed why am i being prejudiced against that i am paying 50  more for my food just because i am british 
1806	2.0	It's OK, really OK, but.  The whole experience is really disjointed... go round this side of the building queue up order, go round the other side with your radio-burger-ready-thing, try to find a table in the sort of open for everyone to walk in or out or past you piazza dining area.  Sit down, wait and watch all the staff in the burger pick-uppy-area seemingly doing nothing, when the thing buzzes, walk over to the burger pick-up area, hope no-one steals your table, bag or kid while you're picking up your burger.  If you take your bag and kid your table will be nicked, if you leave your bag to reserve your table your bag will be nicked and then as there's nothing indicating table reservement your table will be nicked etc etc.  Then while you are eating your burger you still have to worry about your bag being nicked as this is Covent Garden which has more pickpockets, cut purses and bag snatchers than the University of Thievery in Naples so you can't really relax and enjoy what is actually quite a tasty lunch.The burgers are good, very good, I especially like the Smoke Shack and I love the chips with that cheesey seemingly synthetic cheese on them.  The shakes and the custard ice cream are unbelievably sweet and really unsuitable for anyone over about 11 years old.It's probably better if you go in a small group, but the end to end experience is disjointed and stressful.  They need to do this in a completely different way, table service would take about 70% of the frustration away and glass walling the eating area with a single entrance/exit in the same way the Jamie Oliver place in the piazza has done would probably fix the rest. So it's a 2 star review for the stress, remove it and it would get a 4 star review.  For now, I would say go to Meat Market, Five Guys or Byron instead.  Any of them would give a better all in lunch experience regardless of the burger differences and all of them sell good burgers.	it s ok  really ok  but   the whole experience is really disjointed    go round this side of the building queue up order  go round the other side with your radio burger ready thing  try to find a table in the sort of open for everyone to walk in or out or past you piazza dining area   sit down  wait and watch all the staff in the burger pick uppy area seemingly doing nothing  when the thing buzzes  walk over to the burger pick up area  hope no one steals your table  bag or kid while you re picking up your burger   if you take your bag and kid your table will be nicked  if you leave your bag to reserve your table your bag will be nicked and then as there s nothing indicating table reservement your table will be nicked etc etc   then while you are eating your burger you still have to worry about your bag being nicked as this is covent garden which has more pickpockets  cut purses and bag snatchers than the university of thievery in naples so you can t really relax and enjoy what is actually quite a tasty lunch the burgers are good  very good  i especially like the smoke shack and i love the chips with that cheesey seemingly synthetic cheese on them   the shakes and the custard ice cream are unbelievably sweet and really unsuitable for anyone over about 11 years old it s probably better if you go in a small group  but the end to end experience is disjointed and stressful   they need to do this in a completely different way  table service would take about 70  of the frustration away and glass walling the eating area with a single entrance exit in the same way the jamie oliver place in the piazza has done would probably fix the rest  so it s a 2 star review for the stress  remove it and it would get a 4 star review   for now  i would say go to meat market  five guys or byron instead   any of them would give a better all in lunch experience regardless of the burger differences and all of them sell good burgers 
1807	3.0	I want to say I love Shake Shack but I don't think I can.Being another US import the burgers themselves are really nice, the meat is moist and juicy and the bread used for the buns is so pillowey-soft I could eat them all day. The house lager is really nice and has a more ale taste, perfect. Here's what stops me from saying I outright love it:- The location. - The price.- The competition.Covent Garden is just too busy and too touristy to allow you to really enjoy eating the food here. The seating is almost always full so you tend to end up sat on odd tables that have been pushed aside by larger groups of people. It's a bit like eating in a packed McDonalds at lunch time in terms of atmosphere.This brings me on to the price! Two burgers, two drinks and a portion of fries will set you back around £30!!! That's just insane, even for London prices.Looking at the receipt for £30 you start to think you could have gone to one of many competing US imported burgers chains (for example Five Guys which are opening up everyone in London atm), enjoyed a very similar quality product for a fraction of the price in a much nicer atmosphere.	i want to say i love shake shack but i don t think i can being another us import the burgers themselves are really nice  the meat is moist and juicy and the bread used for the buns is so pillowey soft i could eat them all day  the house lager is really nice and has a more ale taste  perfect  here s what stops me from saying i outright love it   the location    the price   the competition covent garden is just too busy and too touristy to allow you to really enjoy eating the food here  the seating is almost always full so you tend to end up sat on odd tables that have been pushed aside by larger groups of people  it s a bit like eating in a packed mcdonalds at lunch time in terms of atmosphere this brings me on to the price  two burgers  two drinks and a portion of fries will set you back around  30    that s just insane  even for london prices looking at the receipt for  30 you start to think you could have gone to one of many competing us imported burgers chains  for example five guys which are opening up everyone in london atm   enjoyed a very similar quality product for a fraction of the price in a much nicer atmosphere 
1808	2.0	Not sure what the buzz is about this place. We were in Covent Garden and wanted a change from Meat Market, queued up for ages before ordering, we got cheeseburgers and a concrete apiece. Problem was that once we were done ordering we were ushered out and to a pick up window. We got takeaway as it looked like it would be difficult to get a seat and had to stand by the window in order to wait for the food which took a LONG time.

Heading to an event last night in Covent Garden, there was really only one thing on my mind... 'how quickly can I shake these guys off and get my Shack on'. I was a Shack virgin, you see. No one likes a Shack virgin. When we arrived, we were pretty lucky that there was no queuing. I popped right up and ordered a shack burger and cheese fries. I strong-armed Alex into buying us a frozen custard with the flavour of the month caramel and chocolate. The server didn't have the best English so it was a bit of a struggle to order. I love the fact that the bouncers do a little Shake Shack song when they hand over the food. For my first bite, I was excited and it was so so worth it. A gorgeous burger, my only complaint, too small. A double for sure next time, more meat in my mouth! Or maybe the Shake Shack Stack, I had a taste and that was gooood. The fries were a bit lacklustre, I could have done with more cheese and more cheese. Maybe some more cheese. But I dig that they have ketchup, mayo and mustard, I love a range of condiments. And the frozen custard, well I was about ready to ask it to marry me. Not icecream, not frozen yoghurt, but some beautiful new marriage of flavours. Better than In n Out and Five Guys. Soz, fellas.	 love shack  babyeeee  when this shack s a rockin  don t come a knockin  basically don t interrupt me when i m eating  heading to an event last night in covent garden  there was really only one thing on my mind     how quickly can i shake these guys off and get my shack on   i was a shack virgin  you see  no one likes a shack virgin  when we arrived  we were pretty lucky that there was no queuing  i popped right up and ordered a shack burger and cheese fries  i strong armed alex into buying us a frozen custard with the flavour of the month caramel and chocolate  the server didn t have the best english so it was a bit of a struggle to order  i love the fact that the bouncers do a little shake shack song when they hand over the food  for my first bite  i was excited and it was so so worth it  a gorgeous burger  my only complaint  too small  a double for sure next time  more meat in my mouth  or maybe the shake shack stack  i had a taste and that was gooood  the fries were a bit lacklustre  i could have done with more cheese and more cheese  maybe some more cheese  but i dig that they have ketchup  mayo and mustard  i love a range of condiments  and the frozen custard  well i was about ready to ask it to marry me  not icecream  not frozen yoghurt  but some beautiful new marriage of flavours  better than in n out and five guys  soz  fellas 
1810	2.0	So underwhelmed. Shake Shack in NYC is a must for me every time I'm there. There are many reasons for that. Unfortunately, most of those reasons do not apply for their new London branch.Two stars go completely for the Peanut Butter shake. Pure awesomeness and delicious in every way. This is where the likeness to their staple NYC branches stop.It cost £16 for a double burger, fries and shake. Wow, that hurt. My burger came really under-cooked. When I showed the manager, he instantly snapped back at me saying, 'We cook them for 30 seconds on each side, that's how it's supposed to be.' No sir, burgers should not ever be prepared where they are still raw...unless you're at a raw food place. Also, not really a great introduction when you challenge the customer and tell them they are wrong.The hype is just not deserved. I didn't mind waiting in line, I did it for the Five Guys launch as well. The difference is that the experience and food at Shake Shack just wasn't there. That and the price are likely to keep me steered towards going to Five Guys instead.	so underwhelmed  shake shack in nyc is a must for me every time i m there  there are many reasons for that  unfortunately  most of those reasons do not apply for their new london branch two stars go completely for the peanut butter shake  pure awesomeness and delicious in every way  this is where the likeness to their staple nyc branches stop it cost  16 for a double burger  fries and shake  wow  that hurt  my burger came really under cooked  when i showed the manager  he instantly snapped back at me saying   we cook them for 30 seconds on each side  that s how it s supposed to be   no sir  burgers should not ever be prepared where they are still raw   unless you re at a raw food place  also  not really a great introduction when you challenge the customer and tell them they are wrong the hype is just not deserved  i didn t mind waiting in line  i did it for the five guys launch as well  the difference is that the experience and food at shake shack just wasn t there  that and the price are likely to keep me steered towards going to five guys instead 
1811	4.0	Ever since I moved here from NYC almost a year ago, I've been pining for Shake Shack.  I had a serious addiction back in the day, my foodie friends.  You probably would have had one too if you lived right around the corner.Luckily, despite our year long separation, our reunion in London was filled with tears and joy.  We went around 10 pm, and the line was about 15 minutes long, much better than any of the lines I'd ever seen at Madison Park.  Prices were the same as the ones in New York, except in pounds... cheeky monkeys.I ordered the Double Smoke Shack, my staple, which is a lovely mishmash of bacon, tomatoes, double patties (was asked medium rare or well done, I think we all know the answer here).  I prefer this over the Shack Stack which is a heart stopping (literally) decadence of meat and fried mushrooms stuffed with cheese.  I wasn't a fan of the bread as it got soggy very quickly, but everything between the buns was lovely.  Completed the lovely meal with the Union Jack custard.  I absolutely loved that they used locally sourced ingredients- even in the custard, they used Paul A Young's chocolate.  The fries were crispy and actually better than the ones I had in New York.The wait was only 5 minutes after ordering, and in the meantime, we checked out the photobooth.  Yea, shit just got real. There is a photobooth.	ever since i moved here from nyc almost a year ago  i ve been pining for shake shack   i had a serious addiction back in the day  my foodie friends   you probably would have had one too if you lived right around the corner luckily  despite our year long separation  our reunion in london was filled with tears and joy   we went around 10 pm  and the line was about 15 minutes long  much better than any of the lines i d ever seen at madison park   prices were the same as the ones in new york  except in pounds    cheeky monkeys i ordered the double smoke shack  my staple  which is a lovely mishmash of bacon  tomatoes  double patties  was asked medium rare or well done  i think we all know the answer here    i prefer this over the shack stack which is a heart stopping  literally  decadence of meat and fried mushrooms stuffed with cheese   i wasn t a fan of the bread as it got soggy very quickly  but everything between the buns was lovely   completed the lovely meal with the union jack custard   i absolutely loved that they used locally sourced ingredients  even in the custard  they used paul a young s chocolate   the fries were crispy and actually better than the ones i had in new york the wait was only 5 minutes after ordering  and in the meantime  we checked out the photobooth   yea  shit just got real  there is a photobooth 
1812	4.0	A few months ago, this would have been a 5 star review. I love their buns. LOVE THEM. Potato rolls are so properly American. As much as I enjoy the burgers and the sauce, I get full quickly and have, many times, prioritised the bread over the meat. It's that good.I'm also a huge fan of their fries and cheese sauce. Basically, put cheese sauce on anything and I'm a pretty happy girl. They're messy and gooey and every time I think I should order the cheese sauce on the side but I never do, and enjoy every messy bite.I also think that the value is pretty good. I go with my husband and he often gets a double burger, I get a single, we share fries, and we share a drink - and it's more than we can eat for under £25. For central London, this is pretty decent. I see lots of tables where everyone had their own fries and really, no one finishes them. As a proper American from the midwest, I can't deny that I'm a hot dog fanatic. Shake Shack do all-beef hot dogs, which is definitely my favourite. I happily ordered one today (with cheese sauce, natch. Whenever cheese is an option, I take it). And I excitedly took my first bite of lovely bun and tasty cheese and then - oh. Wait. This hot dog isn't actually all that great. And it's kind of small. My change of heart is all the fault of Five Guys. I must admit, they do better hot dogs. There, I said it.  I spent the entire dinner not eating much hot dog and coveting my husband's burger. (He relented, and I had a bit at the end). My advice is stick with the burgers, have some cheese sauce on anything you can, and save room for the frozen custard - it's so smooth and delicious.	a few months ago  this would have been a 5 star review  i love their buns  love them  potato rolls are so properly american  as much as i enjoy the burgers and the sauce  i get full quickly and have  many times  prioritised the bread over the meat  it s that good i m also a huge fan of their fries and cheese sauce  basically  put cheese sauce on anything and i m a pretty happy girl  they re messy and gooey and every time i think i should order the cheese sauce on the side but i never do  and enjoy every messy bite i also think that the value is pretty good  i go with my husband and he often gets a double burger  i get a single  we share fries  and we share a drink   and it s more than we can eat for under  25  for central london  this is pretty decent  i see lots of tables where everyone had their own fries and really  no one finishes them  as a proper american from the midwest  i can t deny that i m a hot dog fanatic  shake shack do all beef hot dogs  which is definitely my favourite  i happily ordered one today  with cheese sauce  natch  whenever cheese is an option  i take it   and i excitedly took my first bite of lovely bun and tasty cheese and then   oh  wait  this hot dog isn t actually all that great  and it s kind of small  my change of heart is all the fault of five guys  i must admit  they do better hot dogs  there  i said it   i spent the entire dinner not eating much hot dog and coveting my husband s burger   he relented  and i had a bit at the end   my advice is stick with the burgers  have some cheese sauce on anything you can  and save room for the frozen custard   it s so smooth and delicious 
1813	4.0	Shake Shack do good burgers but perhaps not the best. After all London is covered in decent burger joints right now and these guys might make it into a top 8 perhaps. However the cheese fries are a must and the frozen custards is brilliant. Plus if you absolutely need a beer then you can get one.As for the downsides, the hotdogs are better than most but Five Guys are so much better. The sitting area is very noisy for the inside and the outside is always crazy busy. None of this stops me from coming back of course, but I still dream of MeatEasy in those wintery days...	shake shack do good burgers but perhaps not the best  after all london is covered in decent burger joints right now and these guys might make it into a top 8 perhaps  however the cheese fries are a must and the frozen custards is brilliant  plus if you absolutely need a beer then you can get one as for the downsides  the hotdogs are better than most but five guys are so much better  the sitting area is very noisy for the inside and the outside is always crazy busy  none of this stops me from coming back of course  but i still dream of meateasy in those wintery days

1815	4.0	I first hit Shake Shack on their opening day but I've held off writing a review until I could revisit for a more typical experience. Opening day was awesome with almost as many staff as customers (and since the seating area was full and there was a line - there were just a ton of staff). Everyone was smiling and welcoming, a number of the staff (both local Londoners and experienced NYC staff brought in as trainers) stopped by for a chat, and even Danny Meyer was making the rounds to talk to as many people as possible. What struck me is that some of the staff I talked to at the opening remembered me when I came back three weeks later - bonus points on customer service!My two favourites are the SmokeShack (a smokey bacon double cheeseburger) and the Shake Stack (a cheeseburger with a deep fried portabello mushroom). The SmokeShack is garnished with cherry peppers and is a pretty solid burger. Two patties covered in cheese and topped with bacon is everything you could hope for in a fast food burger and the spiciness of the cherry peppers gives you a nice warming feel. This isn't an amazing burger - I won't be waxing lyrical on the blend of meats or the softness of the bun - but it's exactly what you want. I'd say think of a middle ground between McD's and Lucky Chip.The Shack Stack is actually my favourite with the meaty portabello mushroom being even beefier than the patty and giving a great breadth of flavours. The one thing it was missing was that bit of heat the SmokeShack can boast. So an easily solution - get them to add it on, something the staff are happy to do. Next, take a look at the custards and concretes. I know some friends love the strawberry shortbread custard (and it is pretty good), but the concretes are the key to my heart. While one has been kept from the US menu, the rest are new designs using local bakeries - in particular St. John's. The Big Blend and the Sticky Toffee concrete are excellent which creamy ice cream, brown sugar biscuit bits, and rich chunks of decadent chocolate brownies all mixed in. You can opt for singles or doubles and I'd strongly suggest the double for two reasons: 1) people are going to want a taste and 2) the single is just not enough to satisfy the craving.Shake Shack sells a range of wine and beer including their own bespoke Shackmeister Ale. However, I've always opted for a concrete so I really couldn't comment - I do want to try that ale so maybe I'll push for it next time.	i first hit shake shack on their opening day but i ve held off writing a review until i could revisit for a more typical experience  opening day was awesome with almost as many staff as customers  and since the seating area was full and there was a line   there were just a ton of staff   everyone was smiling and welcoming  a number of the staff  both local londoners and experienced nyc staff brought in as trainers  stopped by for a chat  and even danny meyer was making the rounds to talk to as many people as possible  what struck me is that some of the staff i talked to at the opening remembered me when i came back three weeks later   bonus points on customer service my two favourites are the smokeshack  a smokey bacon double cheeseburger  and the shake stack  a cheeseburger with a deep fried portabello mushroom   the smokeshack is garnished with cherry peppers and is a pretty solid burger  two patties covered in cheese and topped with bacon is everything you could hope for in a fast food burger and the spiciness of the cherry peppers gives you a nice warming feel  this isn t an amazing burger   i won t be waxing lyrical on the blend of meats or the softness of the bun   but it s exactly what you want  i d say think of a middle ground between mcd s and lucky chip the shack stack is actually my favourite with the meaty portabello mushroom being even beefier than the patty and giving a great breadth of flavours  the one thing it was missing was that bit of heat the smokeshack can boast  so an easily solution   get them to add it on  something the staff are happy to do  next  take a look at the custards and concretes  i know some friends love the strawberry shortbread custard  and it is pretty good   but the concretes are the key to my heart  while one has been kept from the us menu  the rest are new designs using local bakeries   in particular st  john s  the big blend and the sticky toffee concrete are excellent which creamy ice cream  brown sugar biscuit bits  and rich chunks of decadent chocolate brownies all mixed in  you can opt for singles or doubles and i d strongly suggest the double for two reasons  1  people are going to want a taste and 2  the single is just not enough to satisfy the craving shake shack sells a range of wine and beer including their own bespoke shackmeister ale  however  i ve always opted for a concrete so i really couldn t comment   i do want to try that ale so maybe i ll push for it next time

Spare chairs with no tables. With all the waiters around, you'd expect someone to usher you to a table.

1821	2.0	The food is actually very good, one of the best veggie burgers I have had in a long time (shroom burger) and the selection of milkshakes are very good even if they are a little pricey and rather tiny in size.However since this is a fast food place in my opinion it has the slowest service in the world. I know its a new place in a very popular tourist location, but the queue at the front of the shack is at least 30-40 minutes before you have even ordered. Then around another 30 minutes until the food arrives, but thats not too bad since they give you a flashing pager device which is always entertaining and fun to bully your friends who get their order last. However if you then have to wait another 30 minutes because your milkshake didn't arrive and have to chase down service it just loses a lot of its appeal. I think if they rethink the ordering a little it would have gotten more stars, but since places like GBK and Byron actually have better milkshakes in my opinion (oreo milkshake all the way, also twice the size and cheaper). and with much much faster service I will be going there instead.	the food is actually very good  one of the best veggie burgers i have had in a long time  shroom burger  and the selection of milkshakes are very good even if they are a little pricey and rather tiny in size however since this is a fast food place in my opinion it has the slowest service in the world  i know its a new place in a very popular tourist location  but the queue at the front of the shack is at least 30 40 minutes before you have even ordered  then around another 30 minutes until the food arrives  but thats not too bad since they give you a flashing pager device which is always entertaining and fun to bully your friends who get their order last  however if you then have to wait another 30 minutes because your milkshake didn t arrive and have to chase down service it just loses a lot of its appeal  i think if they rethink the ordering a little it would have gotten more stars  but since places like gbk and byron actually have better milkshakes in my opinion  oreo milkshake all the way  also twice the size and cheaper   and with much much faster service i will be going there instead

1823	4.0	Last year, we had burritos, this year, the new food craze sweeping through London is burgers and milkshakes. Not that Im complaining mind you, but my weightloss goals are.4th July week saw not one but two (like, totally) burger and shake places open. Mrs K last night compared these two to McDonalds in terms of size and global market share, to which I gave her an incredulous look, so she retracted that remark, but apparently Shake Shack is pretty big over the US.I got there late (no surprises there), and got told that I'd been ordered for. Why? Because Shake Shack isnt a 'sit-down-and-have-your-order-taken' place, it's a queue-up-and-order-and then-find-a-seat kinda place, which to me, adds some credence to what Mrs K said about this being like McDonalds.The food however is a lot better than McD's which is why it gets 4 dreamy stars. I had a mushroom burger which was, and I quote, 'well f*cking nice', cheesy crinkled fries which were really good, a very creamy milkshake and also some frozen custard thing with chocolate chunks in. Later, I had indigestion and a mild heart attack.Go here!	last year  we had burritos  this year  the new food craze sweeping through london is burgers and milkshakes  not that im complaining mind you  but my weightloss goals are 4th july week saw not one but two  like  totally  burger and shake places open  mrs k last night compared these two to mcdonalds in terms of size and global market share  to which i gave her an incredulous look  so she retracted that remark  but apparently shake shack is pretty big over the us i got there late  no surprises there   and got told that i d been ordered for  why  because shake shack isnt a  sit down and have your order taken  place  it s a queue up and order and then find a seat kinda place  which to me  adds some credence to what mrs k said about this being like mcdonalds the food however is a lot better than mcd s which is why it gets 4 dreamy stars  i had a mushroom burger which was  and i quote   well f cking nice   cheesy crinkled fries which were really good  a very creamy milkshake and also some frozen custard thing with chocolate chunks in  later  i had indigestion and a mild heart attack go here 
1824	5.0	It's been 4 years since I last experienced a Shake Shack burger (in NYC), and the taste has been stuck in my memory since that afternoon. Funnily enough - my first Shake Shack burger was shortly after becoming a meat-eater after a long stint of vegetarianism, so just the taste of meat might have added to the ecstasy. Nonetheless, the shack burger was an experience that set the bar for so many other disappointments....and don't even get me started on the frozen custard.(I mean really - frozen god. damn. custard. What's not to love?!)Happy to report that London's Shake Shack is just as good as the American ones, and honestly, the queue was even quicker than my NYC experience.It's amazing. Go here.  the shack sauce changes lives.Don't believe the haters.

1827	3.0	LIke everyone, I loved shake shack in NYC and was very excited to hear it was crossing the pond. My boyfriend & I came a couple of weeks after opening, around 6 on a Friday night. We queued for maybe 15 minutes to get into the little ordering hut (surely the whole design could have been better thought out?!) - it was fairly manic in there but service was friendly and as quick as it could have been.You get a buzzer, go find a seat, and then wait for it to off, at which point you go and collect your food from the hut. I personally don't have a problem doing this, but I think when you're paying as much as you do for your food, you should probably get it brought to you.So, the burger itself tastes like a glamorous big mac...it was tasty, I think it has translated well from its transatlantic big brother, but there are better burgers in London so it hasn't ousted any of its competition. The crinkly fries were cold. I wasn't impressed by them at all and thought they were a waste of calories. My boyfriend liked his cheese fries, but you could smother anything in plastic cheese and he would love it (he's still crying that the US has cheez whizz and we don't...)Also, I ordered a large glass of wine and was given a small!!!! I was pretty annoyed by this, but couldn't be bothered looking like a big wino so didn't complain about it. I should have in hindsight. Overall, burgers are okay, but I wouldn't rush back. The only reason I might is that its quite central, and has outdoor seating, so I can go and bring my puppy with me - which is suddenly a big deciding factor on where we eat and socialise...well, at least until I can wean him off being so dependant on me!	like everyone  i loved shake shack in nyc and was very excited to hear it was crossing the pond  my boyfriend   i came a couple of weeks after opening  around 6 on a friday night  we queued for maybe 15 minutes to get into the little ordering hut  surely the whole design could have been better thought out      it was fairly manic in there but service was friendly and as quick as it could have been you get a buzzer  go find a seat  and then wait for it to off  at which point you go and collect your food from the hut  i personally don t have a problem doing this  but i think when you re paying as much as you do for your food  you should probably get it brought to you so  the burger itself tastes like a glamorous big mac   it was tasty  i think it has translated well from its transatlantic big brother  but there are better burgers in london so it hasn t ousted any of its competition  the crinkly fries were cold  i wasn t impressed by them at all and thought they were a waste of calories  my boyfriend liked his cheese fries  but you could smother anything in plastic cheese and he would love it  he s still crying that the us has cheez whizz and we don t    also  i ordered a large glass of wine and was given a small     i was pretty annoyed by this  but couldn t be bothered looking like a big wino so didn t complain about it  i should have in hindsight  overall  burgers are okay  but i wouldn t rush back  the only reason i might is that its quite central  and has outdoor seating  so i can go and bring my puppy with me   which is suddenly a big deciding factor on where we eat and socialise   well  at least until i can wean him off being so dependant on me 
1828	4.0	Quite pricey considering the size of the portion of fries. Had to queue for a while also there was no seats when we got our food so by the time we sat down the food had gone a bit cold. The staff did try their best to get us seats. Chocolate milkshake was very delicious.	quite pricey considering the size of the portion of fries  had to queue for a while also there was no seats when we got our food so by the time we sat down the food had gone a bit cold  the staff did try their best to get us seats  chocolate milkshake was very delicious

1830	4.0	YUM! I LOVE Shake Shack! However, I DISLIKE the giant line up of people I have to endure to get my food. The burgers are just about worth waiting in the giant line up. The staff are very efficient at keeping the line moving, so you don't feel like you're waiting forever and a day to get your food. Standard wait time, about 20 minutes before you're eating. If you want a table, in the summer at least, you need a partner to save the table while you order and collect the food. You feel like once you get in to order, you're at the end of your waiting game. But those dreams are quickly shattered when you're handed a buzzer and told to wait on the inside of the market (you can't see these people when you start lining up). They don't let you sit down at a table until you've ordered or if your partner is about to order. The food is really good, a bit pricey though, it was about £25 for two people to dine. The burger is not very thick, as it is American fast food. That's where my problem with the price comes in. Unlike Byron's thick burgers, these are not very thick. I do love their burgers though. So delicious! I also love having iced tea and lemonade as an option. On every review, I have to mention I am North American for different reasons, and because of this fact, I miss proper iced tea everyday that I live in the United Kingdom. In the land of tea, I can't understand why proper iced tea is not available here (Lipton doesn't count). So, when I went to Shake Shack and saw I could get both (even a mix of both!), I was overjoyed and binged on proper iced tea and lemonade. I always leave a very satisfied customer. :)This review is making me crave Shake Shack now. That should be sufficient enough for you to go try it at least once in your lifetime.	yum  i love shake shack  however  i dislike the giant line up of people i have to endure to get my food  the burgers are just about worth waiting in the giant line up  the staff are very efficient at keeping the line moving  so you don t feel like you re waiting forever and a day to get your food  standard wait time  about 20 minutes before you re eating  if you want a table  in the summer at least  you need a partner to save the table while you order and collect the food  you feel like once you get in to order  you re at the end of your waiting game  but those dreams are quickly shattered when you re handed a buzzer and told to wait on the inside of the market  you can t see these people when you start lining up   they don t let you sit down at a table until you ve ordered or if your partner is about to order  the food is really good  a bit pricey though  it was about  25 for two people to dine  the burger is not very thick  as it is american fast food  that s where my problem with the price comes in  unlike byron s thick burgers  these are not very thick  i do love their burgers though  so delicious  i also love having iced tea and lemonade as an option  on every review  i have to mention i am north american for different reasons  and because of this fact  i miss proper iced tea everyday that i live in the united kingdom  in the land of tea  i can t understand why proper iced tea is not available here  lipton doesn t count   so  when i went to shake shack and saw i could get both  even a mix of both    i was overjoyed and binged on proper iced tea and lemonade  i always leave a very satisfied customer    this review is making me crave shake shack now  that should be sufficient enough for you to go try it at least once in your lifetime 
1831	5.0	"Like many other Yelpers, I first visited ShakeShack in New York a few years ago. For a long time, it remained my favourite fast food burger, surpassed only by In-N-Out in California. Understandably, I was very excited to hear about them launching in the UK, but concerned about whether the quality would match up to the original in NYC.Thankfully, those concerns were unwarranted. I've made two trips to London's ShakeShack since it opened. My thoughts as follows:ShackBurger - just as good as the one I had a few years ago. The meat is very juicy (but not greasy) and the cheese melts perfectly. Make sure you get a double, and hold it in the paper wrapper - the bun will absorb lots of the juices that would otherwise escape. I've heard of people ordering triples and quadruples, and I'll probably be attempting this on my next visit.SmokeShack - a bit like the ShackBurger, but with added spice and bacon. A good choice if you like your burger a bit of fire in your burger!Fries - all of the fries are crinkle cut, light and not too greasy. A perfect compliment to the burgers.Concretes - frozen custard / ice cream desserts. These are amazing and well worth getting. Quite filling though - so probably worth sharing if you're getting a double burger and fries as well!On the drinks side, I can recommend the iced tea, or the Fifty/Fifty (mix of lemonade and iced tea) if you want something sweeter. Both are great on a hot day!I've also been pleasantly surprised by the length of the queue - so far I've had to wait 20 minutes at most (on a Friday evening and Saturday lunch time). I expected it to be far longer - but they've been able to keep it moving quickly.As a burger fan, ShakeShack is a welcome addition to the London burger scene - it's fast food (don't expect the full ""gourmet"" sit down restaurant experience here) and perfectly fills the gap between traditional fast food options and the more upmarket burger joints that have popped up in the past few years.

1834	3.0	Though now accustomed to paying over £9 for a bourgeois burger in London, this American was a taken aback to see that sticker on an otherwise long-hard-day, blue collar burger.Let's be clear - I abhor the burger scene in London. There is no middle ground between what's being pitched as gourmet and that OEM crap churned out by countless kebab joints. And yes, I want my beef with hormones and extra cruelty, please.Shake Shack's (and Five Guys') arrival heralds a new phase in the US-UK love affair in food and pop culture - all good things, to be sure. Customer service is A+ American but could be perceived as a tad excessive by locals. But I am glad if not grateful for their nudging of the fast food scene in the right, if not greasier, direction.Now let's hope their prices do the same.	though now accustomed to paying over  9 for a bourgeois burger in london  this american was a taken aback to see that sticker on an otherwise long hard day  blue collar burger let s be clear   i abhor the burger scene in london  there is no middle ground between what s being pitched as gourmet and that oem crap churned out by countless kebab joints  and yes  i want my beef with hormones and extra cruelty  please shake shack s  and five guys   arrival heralds a new phase in the us uk love affair in food and pop culture   all good things  to be sure  customer service is a  american but could be perceived as a tad excessive by locals  but i am glad if not grateful for their nudging of the fast food scene in the right  if not greasier  direction now let s hope their prices do the same 
1835	3.0	The wait, the fries and the greasy, all put together for a decent, but unfulfilling experience. There are some plus points, i.e. that the SmokeShack really is a nice burger for the money, especially at £6.50 for a nice bacon covered burger. However, the bun was very greasy and by the end, the burger was disintegrating and leaving grease marks on my hands despite the wax paper bag it came in. Now, I'm all for a nice greasy burger and getting my hands dirty, but when you provide a waxed bag and it still leaks through, I'm not entirely sure how to take it.Anyway, the fries are pretty darn good. They're simple, yet stand up to the damp London weather (especially if you sit outside). They still remain crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. There seems to be a coating of corn flour or something on the outside to keep them crispy I suppose. However, amongst the burger places that have begun popping up everywhere in London, I'd say the fries still don't hold a candle to those at Honest Burger. All in all a good meal, but there's very little inside seating, so be prepared to shiver a little, get a bit greasy and eat cold fries. Otherwise, if stuck in the CG area, hungry for a decent burger and not enough time to travel towards Soho, I'd say Shake Shack would be my go to place.	the wait  the fries and the greasy  all put together for a decent  but unfulfilling experience  there are some plus points  i e  that the smokeshack really is a nice burger for the money  especially at  6 50 for a nice bacon covered burger  however  the bun was very greasy and by the end  the burger was disintegrating and leaving grease marks on my hands despite the wax paper bag it came in  now  i m all for a nice greasy burger and getting my hands dirty  but when you provide a waxed bag and it still leaks through  i m not entirely sure how to take it anyway  the fries are pretty darn good  they re simple  yet stand up to the damp london weather  especially if you sit outside   they still remain crispy on the outside and moist on the inside  there seems to be a coating of corn flour or something on the outside to keep them crispy i suppose  however  amongst the burger places that have begun popping up everywhere in london  i d say the fries still don t hold a candle to those at honest burger  all in all a good meal  but there s very little inside seating  so be prepared to shiver a little  get a bit greasy and eat cold fries  otherwise  if stuck in the cg area  hungry for a decent burger and not enough time to travel towards soho  i d say shake shack would be my go to place 
1836	2.0	A real disappointment. I was keen to try Shake Shack having already tried its fellow American invader, Five Guys to compare the two. I waited until 3pm for lunch in order to avoid the queues but it still took 20 minutes to place my order. The queue is a clever marketing trick to make people think that the burgers must be great but in reality it is due to them choosing a poor location where only a dozen people can be inside at one time. There is also no indoor seating which considering London's typical climate is a bit of a faux pas, in fact there is not much seating at all. One thing they did better than Five Guys was to have the buzzers that told you when your order was ready.I ordered the Shack Burger without cheese, crinkle cut fries and a coke which came to exactly £10. The burger itself was of good quality but was nothing special. The bun seemed to be soaked in fat and was exceptionally greasy. The fries were the best part of the meal, probably the best crinkle cut chips I have tasted which saves this review from being 1 star.If they open another location I might try Shake Shack again but I wont be back to the Covent Garden incarnation.	a real disappointment  i was keen to try shake shack having already tried its fellow american invader  five guys to compare the two  i waited until 3pm for lunch in order to avoid the queues but it still took 20 minutes to place my order  the queue is a clever marketing trick to make people think that the burgers must be great but in reality it is due to them choosing a poor location where only a dozen people can be inside at one time  there is also no indoor seating which considering london s typical climate is a bit of a faux pas  in fact there is not much seating at all  one thing they did better than five guys was to have the buzzers that told you when your order was ready i ordered the shack burger without cheese  crinkle cut fries and a coke which came to exactly  10  the burger itself was of good quality but was nothing special  the bun seemed to be soaked in fat and was exceptionally greasy  the fries were the best part of the meal  probably the best crinkle cut chips i have tasted which saves this review from being 1 star if they open another location i might try shake shack again but i wont be back to the covent garden incarnation 
1837	4.0	I discovered Shake Shack for the first time when I was in New York two years ago. We went 3 times. So I had been really looking forward to their opening in Convent Garden last year.And they didn't disappoint. The same great, tasteful burgers as we had in NYC. The meat is so juicy and I don't want to know how much butter goes into those things, but God, I love them. I normally am no fan at all for cheese of my fries, but last time I tried it for the first time and loved it as well. No fan of shakes so can't commend on it.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the wait. I know Londoners almost enjoy it, but you really need to ask yourself how much of your time is worth a burger. I would seriously advice to go but try off-peak hours (though not sure how much better the wait is then).	i discovered shake shack for the first time when i was in new york two years ago  we went 3 times  so i had been really looking forward to their opening in convent garden last year and they didn t disappoint  the same great  tasteful burgers as we had in nyc  the meat is so juicy and i don t want to know how much butter goes into those things  but god  i love them  i normally am no fan at all for cheese of my fries  but last time i tried it for the first time and loved it as well  no fan of shakes so can t commend on it the only reason i m not giving this 5 stars is the wait  i know londoners almost enjoy it  but you really need to ask yourself how much of your time is worth a burger  i would seriously advice to go but try off peak hours  though not sure how much better the wait is then  
1838	4.0	Went on a weekday around 1pm and it was not that busy which I was happy about as other reviews stated the line was long. I ordered the Shakeburger and chips. The burger was quite small!!! from the pictures I've seen I was expecting it to be bigger but oh well... Size is not everything I guess.... this burger tasted so good and i was not let down. One thing i would say is maybe getting a double.	went on a weekday around 1pm and it was not that busy which i was happy about as other reviews stated the line was long  i ordered the shakeburger and chips  the burger was quite small    from the pictures i ve seen i was expecting it to be bigger but oh well    size is not everything i guess     this burger tasted so good and i was not let down  one thing i would say is maybe getting a double 
1839	5.0	Since I'm a huge fan when I used to live in NYC close to the Madison location, after a week of opening here in London we brought a friend who has never tried Shake Shack before. And she was impressed. The food was exactly like NYC's... the bun was buttery golden, the burger juicy and fresh. I don't know what their magic ingredient is but everything tasted perfect together. We also got the ice-cream shake and cheesy fries, so we were really feeling it afterwards. But so worth the food coma... this is one of my favorite burger joints and if it wasn't for the fact that I used to go so many times in NYC, I would go back in a heartbeat.	since i m a huge fan when i used to live in nyc close to the madison location  after a week of opening here in london we brought a friend who has never tried shake shack before  and she was impressed  the food was exactly like nyc s    the bun was buttery golden  the burger juicy and fresh  i don t know what their magic ingredient is but everything tasted perfect together  we also got the ice cream shake and cheesy fries  so we were really feeling it afterwards  but so worth the food coma    this is one of my favorite burger joints and if it wasn t for the fact that i used to go so many times in nyc  i would go back in a heartbeat 
1840	3.0	So ShakeShak.. I've wanted to try it for a long time but the queues were a big no-no.I assume you know where they stand price-wise, in the middle class of all the burger joints.I've tried their SmokeShack burger with chips and a Peanutbutter shake. Washed it all down with a beer.It was a pleasurable experience, the queues were short and the food was good. My burger was well cooked, albeit a bit on the small side. The chips were nice and crunchy and the shake out of this world. However, the total came to £20 and for a place without table service I found it slightly high. I'll probably return - the shakes are brilliant and they make such a good match with the burgers but I won't rush into it.	so shakeshak   i ve wanted to try it for a long time but the queues were a big no no i assume you know where they stand price wise  in the middle class of all the burger joints i ve tried their smokeshack burger with chips and a peanutbutter shake  washed it all down with a beer it was a pleasurable experience  the queues were short and the food was good  my burger was well cooked  albeit a bit on the small side  the chips were nice and crunchy and the shake out of this world  however  the total came to  20 and for a place without table service i found it slightly high  i ll probably return   the shakes are brilliant and they make such a good match with the burgers but i won t rush into it 
1841	4.0	Great food, the veggie burger especially is really delicious! Service was top notch too, and you can get a glass of wine or a beer with your burger. I can't wait to go back in the summer, my only suggestion for now is to have heaters outside as I really wanted frozen custard dessert and had to brace the cold outside with it as there were no free seats in doors!	great food  the veggie burger especially is really delicious  service was top notch too  and you can get a glass of wine or a beer with your burger  i can t wait to go back in the summer  my only suggestion for now is to have heaters outside as i really wanted frozen custard dessert and had to brace the cold outside with it as there were no free seats in doors 
1842	4.0	Allow 10-15 minutes to queue and make sure you grab a menu from the person checking the queue so you are ready to order once you get into the order room. Your food will take another 5-10 minutes once you order.My order: Single Shackburger, (crinkle) Fries , Regular Coke and two scoops of Frozen Custard in a Tub!I'd heard about the launch of this venue in July and wanted to go experience it myself.The staff were busy yet friendly. If you are in a group grab a table and wait for your food buzzer to tell you food is ready. The is a choice of three seating areas. I ended up sitting outside under the patio heaters trying to fend off one of the brave pigeons. The frozen custard is a thick mixed soft serve ice cream and it was really tasty. The burger was also very nice. I presume most people would want the double though. Don't order the single and get shocked its small. It means small!

1843	4.0	Same quality as NYC branches, smokeshack + shake is always a nice combination. I enjoyed the mild spice being cooled down by the chocolate shake.On the flip side, the beef can be a little more juicy - not a huge impact to the food quality, but something to think about. Also to think about is the differentiation in fries - right now there're only normal fries & cheese fries, maybe truffle fries could be a good addition.	same quality as nyc branches  smokeshack   shake is always a nice combination  i enjoyed the mild spice being cooled down by the chocolate shake on the flip side  the beef can be a little more juicy   not a huge impact to the food quality  but something to think about  also to think about is the differentiation in fries   right now there re only normal fries   cheese fries  maybe truffle fries could be a good addition

Burgers are over cooked and dry, buns are just tasteless...

The proportions if two single cheese burgers are far better that the double cheese burger, and the price is more than reasonable for the taste!

1848	5.0	Early dinnerWith my other half. They were exceptionally accommodating and attentive.The food itself was pretty good and I'm sure I will go back pretty soon.Chips was extremely crunchy and the burger was impressive as the contents were bigger than buns yet its juiciness is unexpected. The way the cheese melt was so temptatious. We luckily didnt wait so long but you need to plan awaiting to receive food at least ten minutes.Menu was pretty simple and straight forward. The variety of drink is an advantage as you can order wine and beer too.Hence 5 stars	early dinnerwith my other half  they were exceptionally accommodating and attentive the food itself was pretty good and i m sure i will go back pretty soon chips was extremely crunchy and the burger was impressive as the contents were bigger than buns yet its juiciness is unexpected  the way the cheese melt was so temptatious  we luckily didnt wait so long but you need to plan awaiting to receive food at least ten minutes menu was pretty simple and straight forward  the variety of drink is an advantage as you can order wine and beer too hence 5 stars
1849	2.0	I've been to their restaurants in New York City and Las Vegas - really good burgers.  And I've even been to this one in Covent Garden before, last year.  They've never disappointed before.  But this time was different: the burger was served lukewarm (like it had been sitting around for a while).  Battling the zoo to get a replacement is not worth the hassle.  I'll stick to NYC and LAS.	i ve been to their restaurants in new york city and las vegas   really good burgers   and i ve even been to this one in covent garden before  last year   they ve never disappointed before   but this time was different  the burger was served lukewarm  like it had been sitting around for a while    battling the zoo to get a replacement is not worth the hassle   i ll stick to nyc and las 
1850	3.0	I visited four times and I am writing with the bias of absolutely loving Shake Shack in NYC and Philly (as an American). However, I am still feeling disappointed. The food is worth the return, but Shake Shack UK has a LOT to work out in terms of service. Not in terms of friendliness--the people working seem open and friendly and willingness. It is the organization part of service that is lacking. I am cancelling out my opening week visit, as that was chaos. (interestingly, though, with the troops called in from around the world to help, the service was a little more efficient). My other three visits have been uneven. There seems to be some fundamental miscommunication happening between the four feet between the front register and the line cooks working hard in the back. Food comes out unevenly, with people ordering and receiving right away, and the next in line waiting 15-20 minutes for their order, enough time for a companion to have finished their meal. Parts of orders are consistently forgotten or wrong. All three times I ordered concretes, they came out 20 minutes after ordering (which was nice when I ordered it with the meal, but not so great when I ordered it separately after finishing). The staff there seems to be having a nice time and are helpful in finding seats, bringing orders to table, etc., but I wish Shake Shack would focus more on the behind-the-scenes staffing issues. I am getting a bit embarrassed to bring my friends to show them a great American burger, and then consistently have crappy service. It almost feels like Shake Shack UK needs to go behind the counter of a McDonald's (PERISH THE THOUGHT) to learn about efficiencies in orders.The Smoke Stacks, Cheese fries, concretes and Brooklyn Ale will keep me coming back. But as a solo diner sneaking away for a few hours (cause it will take that long) of alone time. Sadface.	i visited four times and i am writing with the bias of absolutely loving shake shack in nyc and philly  as an american   however  i am still feeling disappointed  the food is worth the return  but shake shack uk has a lot to work out in terms of service  not in terms of friendliness  the people working seem open and friendly and willingness  it is the organization part of service that is lacking  i am cancelling out my opening week visit  as that was chaos   interestingly  though  with the troops called in from around the world to help  the service was a little more efficient   my other three visits have been uneven  there seems to be some fundamental miscommunication happening between the four feet between the front register and the line cooks working hard in the back  food comes out unevenly  with people ordering and receiving right away  and the next in line waiting 15 20 minutes for their order  enough time for a companion to have finished their meal  parts of orders are consistently forgotten or wrong  all three times i ordered concretes  they came out 20 minutes after ordering  which was nice when i ordered it with the meal  but not so great when i ordered it separately after finishing   the staff there seems to be having a nice time and are helpful in finding seats  bringing orders to table  etc   but i wish shake shack would focus more on the behind the scenes staffing issues  i am getting a bit embarrassed to bring my friends to show them a great american burger  and then consistently have crappy service  it almost feels like shake shack uk needs to go behind the counter of a mcdonald s  perish the thought  to learn about efficiencies in orders the smoke stacks  cheese fries  concretes and brooklyn ale will keep me coming back  but as a solo diner sneaking away for a few hours  cause it will take that long  of alone time  sadface 
1851	1.0	I was really pissed off after ordering here. The server chided me for not having exact change, and it took 30 minutes to get my order--1 burger and one shake. The total came to £11.50 ($19.11 at time of review). For a soggy slider-size burger and a shake that honestly couldn't be discerned from a mcdonalds one.	i was really pissed off after ordering here  the server chided me for not having exact change  and it took 30 minutes to get my order  1 burger and one shake  the total came to  11 50   19 11 at time of review   for a soggy slider size burger and a shake that honestly couldn t be discerned from a mcdonalds one 
1852	4.0	4 stars for the gooey cheesy shroomburger alone. which I ordered because I haven't heard stellar things about the burgers themselves and I have high standards and also, it's good to be veggie once in a while!So, on with the literary food porn - Deep fried portobello mushrooms, sandwiched together with gooey cheese. with crispy lettuce. Just heaven. I tried a bit of my friend smokeshack and it was a solid burger but it's not wow worthy! We also ordered two portions of crinkle cut chips which were lovely if a little on the small portion size and we're small asian girls, but we eat like elephants yeah? It's the world's paradoxes! Topped it off with a shake because I wasn't really feeling concrete just yet! Black and white shake is amazing! I really want one now actually.I find the seating quite haphazard, as in, it's not a service restaurant so I don't know why there are SO many servers. It's a bit too much happening. I mean, you supposed to order then pick an area you want to sit and then bring your buzzer to the table where they have two seaters who look for seats for you, that's their job I assume. And about 3 people are standing at the food collection point to give you ONE tray. They were lovely especially when there was a ketchup queue, and they would go around serving ketchup and mayo but overkill much?PPS: I'm writing this review on some shack glasses I asked very nicely for at the PR launch like way back.	4 stars for the gooey cheesy shroomburger alone  which i ordered because i haven t heard stellar things about the burgers themselves and i have high standards and also  it s good to be veggie once in a while so  on with the literary food porn   deep fried portobello mushrooms  sandwiched together with gooey cheese  with crispy lettuce  just heaven  i tried a bit of my friend smokeshack and it was a solid burger but it s not wow worthy  we also ordered two portions of crinkle cut chips which were lovely if a little on the small portion size and we re small asian girls  but we eat like elephants yeah  it s the world s paradoxes  topped it off with a shake because i wasn t really feeling concrete just yet  black and white shake is amazing  i really want one now actually i find the seating quite haphazard  as in  it s not a service restaurant so i don t know why there are so many servers  it s a bit too much happening  i mean  you supposed to order then pick an area you want to sit and then bring your buzzer to the table where they have two seaters who look for seats for you  that s their job i assume  and about 3 people are standing at the food collection point to give you one tray  they were lovely especially when there was a ketchup queue  and they would go around serving ketchup and mayo but overkill much pps  i m writing this review on some shack glasses i asked very nicely for at the pr launch like way back 
1853	1.0	Hate this place. Tried it once in Dubai and once in London. I should have learned my lesson the first time! I gave this placed one more chance as it was walking past Covent garden and was starving. It's one of the worst hamburgers I have ever had , both times !  First time in Dubai the bun was soggy second time I visited in London the bun or burger had a strange chemical taste. Even the fries/chips with cheese is awful but better then the hamburger. The cheese on the fries consists of some sort of cheap movie theatre type cheese. The theatre cheese is even better then this cheese. It lacks flavour and is all around artificial. Honestly I have no clue why people rate this place so highly... McDonalds has a better burger by far ! It's over priced for horrible food. If you want a burger in London go to Meat Liquor, GBK, Bryon ... There are plenty of superior choices.	hate this place  tried it once in dubai and once in london  i should have learned my lesson the first time  i gave this placed one more chance as it was walking past covent garden and was starving  it s one of the worst hamburgers i have ever had   both times    first time in dubai the bun was soggy second time i visited in london the bun or burger had a strange chemical taste  even the fries chips with cheese is awful but better then the hamburger  the cheese on the fries consists of some sort of cheap movie theatre type cheese  the theatre cheese is even better then this cheese  it lacks flavour and is all around artificial  honestly i have no clue why people rate this place so highly    mcdonalds has a better burger by far   it s over priced for horrible food  if you want a burger in london go to meat liquor  gbk  bryon     there are plenty of superior choices

I am originally from New York, where the whole Shake Shack craze started, so I went in there expecting to order my beloved chicken dog and cheese fries. While they didn't have the chicken dog, they *did* have a delicious mushroom burger that oozed gooey cheese when you bite into it. And the fries are better over here than back in NY. Maybe it's the water?	the fact that i live around the corner from this place is so problematic for my health  i am originally from new york  where the whole shake shack craze started  so i went in there expecting to order my beloved chicken dog and cheese fries  while they didn t have the chicken dog  they  did  have a delicious mushroom burger that oozed gooey cheese when you bite into it  and the fries are better over here than back in ny  maybe it s the water

1862	3.0	There was such hype about this place and the lines were massive so I had high expectations. The burger isn't anything special for me, it's quite small and is more of a step up from maccas.

If you want burgers I recommend toms burger joint or 5 guys only 2 worth a bother I have found but still not like the American beef burgers.	had the shake cago hot dog i think they called it with fries they both were less then satisfactory brits just are terrible at steaks and burgers i keep on finding out with every new restaurant i visit  did not try the burger but i assume it s of similar quality what i hoped to be the star the potato bun roll was nothing like what i am used too  if you want burgers i recommend toms burger joint or 5 guys only 2 worth a bother i have found but still not like the american beef burgers

1868	2.0	I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. They promptly took our order, and told to sit down and wait until the unit buzzed.... After 15 mins we went to the window.  I finally chomped on the long awaited burger to find it was pretty straight forward, boring and nothing worth queuing 5mins for let alone 15mins. Compared to Dirty Burger, Honest Burger, Byron and all the other places that have popped up over the past 3-5 years this was the least impressive.	i really don t understand what all the fuss is about  they promptly took our order  and told to sit down and wait until the unit buzzed     after 15 mins we went to the window   i finally chomped on the long awaited burger to find it was pretty straight forward  boring and nothing worth queuing 5mins for let alone 15mins  compared to dirty burger  honest burger  byron and all the other places that have popped up over the past 3 5 years this was the least impressive 
1869	3.0	Since Shake Shack arrived in London, I read very mixed reviews. In the first weeks, there were always enormous queues, so I never dared to try it. Located right in the centre of Covent Garden, you can get there easily, but you should be prepared to wait at least a few minutes. The interior looks okay, but it feels a bit like a fast food chain, everything looks a bit cheap. I did not like, that I have to wait for my food and then pick it up myself at the counter  there are so many staff running around, why can they not bring me my food? I guess this is part of the concept, but I found it a bit weird and annoying. I ordered the SmokeShack™ burger and it was a decent burger. Nothing really special, but there was also nothing wrong with it. Actually, given its size, it is perhaps more a decent slider than a burger. The size also has a good side, because it makes the burger easy to eat, avoiding a big fatty mess. I also went for the crinkle cut cheese fries and they were probably the highlight of my dinner. Nice crispy fries with cheddar cheese on top  I added some small bags of pepper to make it even more enjoyable. I find it a little bit difficult to rate this place. While my burger was a solid piece of food and the crinkle cut cheese fries were a little bit special, it did not feel like a place I like to visit more often. Let alone a trademarked burger name on the menu, that is not even a registered trademark yet (get it, this is Europe, your strange sign does not mean too much over here, and your burger name is probably also protected without it). At the end, I found this place overhyped and overpriced for what it is. Maybe I was expecting too much  if I had the choice between Shake Shack and some of the other burger joints in central London, I think I would prefer one of other options. Not so much for the food, but mostly for the atmosphere. That said, I definitely have to go back to check out the desserts and shakes	since shake shack arrived in london  i read very mixed reviews  in the first weeks  there were always enormous queues  so i never dared to try it  located right in the centre of covent garden  you can get there easily  but you should be prepared to wait at least a few minutes  the interior looks okay  but it feels a bit like a fast food chain  everything looks a bit cheap  i did not like  that i have to wait for my food and then pick it up myself at the counter  there are so many staff running around  why can they not bring me my food  i guess this is part of the concept  but i found it a bit weird and annoying  i ordered the smokeshack  burger and it was a decent burger  nothing really special  but there was also nothing wrong with it  actually  given its size  it is perhaps more a decent slider than a burger  the size also has a good side  because it makes the burger easy to eat  avoiding a big fatty mess  i also went for the crinkle cut cheese fries and they were probably the highlight of my dinner  nice crispy fries with cheddar cheese on top  i added some small bags of pepper to make it even more enjoyable  i find it a little bit difficult to rate this place  while my burger was a solid piece of food and the crinkle cut cheese fries were a little bit special  it did not feel like a place i like to visit more often  let alone a trademarked burger name on the menu  that is not even a registered trademark yet  get it  this is europe  your strange sign does not mean too much over here  and your burger name is probably also protected without it   at the end  i found this place overhyped and overpriced for what it is  maybe i was expecting too much  if i had the choice between shake shack and some of the other burger joints in central london  i think i would prefer one of other options  not so much for the food  but mostly for the atmosphere  that said  i definitely have to go back to check out the desserts and shakes

1872	4.0	I thought the queues would go on forever, but even with glorious sunny weather, we only waited for about 10 minutes. I got the ShackBurger with amazing shack sauce with really great crinkle cut fries and a Big Blend Concrete. I was full so I'm needlessly complaining that the burger was perhaps a little small. However my stomach seems to be pretty tiny compared to other people, so maybe portions could be slightly larger. The concrete was great, although isn't this just (delicious) ice cream? I love the fact they have dog biscuits. If they're anywhere near as good as the human food our canine brethren will be in for a treat.	i thought the queues would go on forever  but even with glorious sunny weather  we only waited for about 10 minutes  i got the shackburger with amazing shack sauce with really great crinkle cut fries and a big blend concrete  i was full so i m needlessly complaining that the burger was perhaps a little small  however my stomach seems to be pretty tiny compared to other people  so maybe portions could be slightly larger  the concrete was great  although isn t this just  delicious  ice cream  i love the fact they have dog biscuits  if they re anywhere near as good as the human food our canine brethren will be in for a treat

1876	4.0	Great burgers and chips. Loved the outdoor seating but also has seating inside. My only gripe was that didnt give salad etc in my burger, which i thought would come as standard but it seems youve gotta ask for it!On pricing, a little more expenise for what it is. All the burgers cost around 8.75 then you gotta add fries on top so pretty costly. Id recommend the cheesy chips and a single classic burger to keep costs to under £10	great burgers and chips  loved the outdoor seating but also has seating inside  my only gripe was that didnt give salad etc in my burger  which i thought would come as standard but it seems youve gotta ask for it on pricing  a little more expenise for what it is  all the burgers cost around 8 75 then you gotta add fries on top so pretty costly  id recommend the cheesy chips and a single classic burger to keep costs to under  10
1877	2.0	Shake Shack were running a lottery yesterday. If you got buzzer 137, you won warm ice cream, cold fries and burgers with an interesting layer of grease after about 20 minutes.Buzzers fail - that's a fact of life I guess, but what followed is how they earned this review.Clearly they have a lot of people paying £25 quid for food and then wandering off because at no point did they think to send a staff member (of which they have dozens lurking to make sure you vacate your seat as soon as possible after taking your last bite) round their seating areas to call for the buzzer number or the name clearly printed on the receipt. What's the point of taking the name if you're not going to use it when your tech fails ? The meal in its various stages of warming, melting and oozing went back and we tried again. A little while later the duty supervisor handed me a tray, gave me a big smile and told me that she hoped I enjoyed my meal. I would have, if it had all been there. So we tried again. But this time she left me standing in the crowd being jostled by every other visitor to Covent Garden on the hottest day of 2013 holding my tray while I watched the ice cream melt. Again.The fries were brilliant in the end, but the shakes were rushed so they were more solid ice cream than anything else and the burgers have a long way to go before they get to Five Guys quality.But hey, if you get buzzer 137, you won't have to worry about the quality of the food because you won't get near it unless you don your Indiana Jones hat and go exploring.Authors note - there was at least 1 other faulty buzzer while we were there. I don't know what they won though.	shake shack were running a lottery yesterday  if you got buzzer 137  you won warm ice cream  cold fries and burgers with an interesting layer of grease after about 20 minutes buzzers fail   that s a fact of life i guess  but what followed is how they earned this review clearly they have a lot of people paying  25 quid for food and then wandering off because at no point did they think to send a staff member  of which they have dozens lurking to make sure you vacate your seat as soon as possible after taking your last bite  round their seating areas to call for the buzzer number or the name clearly printed on the receipt  what s the point of taking the name if you re not going to use it when your tech fails   the meal in its various stages of warming  melting and oozing went back and we tried again  a little while later the duty supervisor handed me a tray  gave me a big smile and told me that she hoped i enjoyed my meal  i would have  if it had all been there  so we tried again  but this time she left me standing in the crowd being jostled by every other visitor to covent garden on the hottest day of 2013 holding my tray while i watched the ice cream melt  again the fries were brilliant in the end  but the shakes were rushed so they were more solid ice cream than anything else and the burgers have a long way to go before they get to five guys quality but hey  if you get buzzer 137  you won t have to worry about the quality of the food because you won t get near it unless you don your indiana jones hat and go exploring authors note   there was at least 1 other faulty buzzer while we were there  i don t know what they won though 
1878	3.0	Heard a lot about this place through mates etc and wasn't very impressed to be honest. The burger was good don't get me wrong double patty and the bun was well cut, their crinkley fries were great with the melted cheese on top. Beer was expensive and that's the major disappointment, it cost me £17 for a burger, fries & beer-too much for that food. Covent Garden is a nice setting and it is tourist town, but it shouldn't cost that much.	heard a lot about this place through mates etc and wasn t very impressed to be honest  the burger was good don t get me wrong double patty and the bun was well cut  their crinkley fries were great with the melted cheese on top  beer was expensive and that s the major disappointment  it cost me  17 for a burger  fries   beer too much for that food  covent garden is a nice setting and it is tourist town  but it shouldn t cost that much

Food is terrific and as reliable as in the US. Took away a star because the food line is a bit cramped and klutzy. That will probabnly iron itself out.	loved it  been to 3 others in the us  this seems to have the most seating  as always  there are an abundance of super friendly employees that will help you find a seat  food is terrific and as reliable as in the us  took away a star because the food line is a bit cramped and klutzy  that will probabnly iron itself out 
1882	2.0	Lovely location, within Covent Garden, no problem getting a table at 8pm on a Saturday night.  I had the Smokeshack burger, which was pretty nice but very small, this was particularly surprising for an American import.  The guys I was with had the double burger and still felt hungry.  The crinkle fries were underwhelming, mostly crispy outside with no soft potato inside.  The vanilla milkshake tasted exactly like a McDonalds shake.  A burger, fries and milkshake cost me over £13.00, which is unreasonable for a bog standard fast food meal.  Burger restaurants are ubiquitous at the moment, don't waste time on this one.	lovely location  within covent garden  no problem getting a table at 8pm on a saturday night   i had the smokeshack burger  which was pretty nice but very small  this was particularly surprising for an american import   the guys i was with had the double burger and still felt hungry   the crinkle fries were underwhelming  mostly crispy outside with no soft potato inside   the vanilla milkshake tasted exactly like a mcdonalds shake   a burger  fries and milkshake cost me over  13 00  which is unreasonable for a bog standard fast food meal   burger restaurants are ubiquitous at the moment  don t waste time on this one

1887	2.0	Meat Liquor's signature Dead Hippie burger is essentially a glorified Big Mac. It comes with two patties, cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions, and a mayonnaise-based sauce. This burger has been praised by many, but I personally didn't see the appeal. I thought that the meat was dry, the bun was ordinary, and the ratio of ingredients was imbalanced.	meat liquor s signature dead hippie burger is essentially a glorified big mac  it comes with two patties  cheese  lettuce  pickles  onions  and a mayonnaise based sauce  this burger has been praised by many  but i personally didn t see the appeal  i thought that the meat was dry  the bun was ordinary  and the ratio of ingredients was imbalanced

I wanted to use the bathroom before ordering obviously so as to have a pleasant sit down. I come out and notice they don't have salads on the menu (greek salad doesn't count) and so i say my thank you's and decide to purchase my meal elsewhere. This dude with a broken tooth, calls me back in and tells me that if i wanted to use the bathroom next time to just ask for it, and then doesn't let me explain myself- COMPLETELY DISMISSES ME....OK so, here it goes....FIRST OF ALL, i am a PAYING CUSTOMER AND HAD ALL INTENTIONS OF EATING THERE. It happened to be that i wanted to use the bathroom first, CAN A BITCH WASH HER HANDS? Apparently not...and dont dismiss me like im a kid. It was soooooo rude! I wont ever be returning, and for my coworkers that recommended this place will definitely tell them to stay away after the terrible service. It was SO RUDE! Literally ruined my whole experience and day....nice going.I feel like going back in there and breaking his other tooth. Luckily I'm a lady.	terrible service  so i walk in  expecting to have a nice meal since my hotel is across the street  and ask to use the bathroom since i just came out of work  i wanted to use the bathroom before ordering obviously so as to have a pleasant sit down  i come out and notice they don t have salads on the menu  greek salad doesn t count  and so i say my thank you s and decide to purchase my meal elsewhere  this dude with a broken tooth  calls me back in and tells me that if i wanted to use the bathroom next time to just ask for it  and then doesn t let me explain myself  completely dismisses me    ok so  here it goes    first of all  i am a paying customer and had all intentions of eating there  it happened to be that i wanted to use the bathroom first  can a bitch wash her hands  apparently not   and dont dismiss me like im a kid  it was soooooo rude  i wont ever be returning  and for my coworkers that recommended this place will definitely tell them to stay away after the terrible service  it was so rude  literally ruined my whole experience and day    nice going i feel like going back in there and breaking his other tooth  luckily i m a lady

1890	4.0	We needed food late night and this was close to our hotel so an easy choice.  We were definitely taken back by the decorations at first but actually really loved the place.  We had a variety of food from the Dead Hippie Burger, to Green Chile Burger, the Braai wings (which were SOOOOO hot) and Hippie Fries.  The Green Chile Burger was alright for me, my friends all enjoyed that and the wings. I was a big, big fan of the Dead Hippie Burger.  The sauce reminds me of a Shack Sauce or In&Out sauce. I will say the service was quite slow and we had to get up and go find a waiter a few times but other than that, I will be dreaming of the Hippie Burger until I return.	we needed food late night and this was close to our hotel so an easy choice   we were definitely taken back by the decorations at first but actually really loved the place   we had a variety of food from the dead hippie burger  to green chile burger  the braai wings  which were sooooo hot  and hippie fries   the green chile burger was alright for me  my friends all enjoyed that and the wings  i was a big  big fan of the dead hippie burger   the sauce reminds me of a shack sauce or in out sauce  i will say the service was quite slow and we had to get up and go find a waiter a few times but other than that  i will be dreaming of the hippie burger until i return

There was limited beer selection but they had a few local beers we tried. Inside seems have a Cold War German kind of vibe. Good music and a little dark inside. Worth a visit, good service and food was served fast.	great spot for a burger and beer  we found this via a youtube travel video and it didn t disappoint  burgers were phenomenal and chili cheese fries warmed us up on a cold day  there was limited beer selection but they had a few local beers we tried  inside seems have a cold war german kind of vibe  good music and a little dark inside  worth a visit  good service and food was served fast 
1892	1.0	I still remember my first dead hippie burger, a few years ago, at their Covent Garden branch. It was heaven in my mouth, and I can say it was the best burger in London I'd had.However, a few years later and now at their Bond Street branch, it looks like the quality of Meat Liquor as gone down the drain as they have expanded. The burger bun was dry, the meat was just OK.Served in a dingy grimey restaurant, on a cafeteria style tray and on top of grease paper, the food needs to be WOW because nothing else about the dining experience is. Unfortunately, its not.	i still remember my first dead hippie burger  a few years ago  at their covent garden branch  it was heaven in my mouth  and i can say it was the best burger in london i d had however  a few years later and now at their bond street branch  it looks like the quality of meat liquor as gone down the drain as they have expanded  the burger bun was dry  the meat was just ok served in a dingy grimey restaurant  on a cafeteria style tray and on top of grease paper  the food needs to be wow because nothing else about the dining experience is  unfortunately  its not 
1893	4.0	Having eaten here before, I knew where I was going but if you've never been here before, one could mistake it for a brothel (just on the looks part) dark windows with signage and inside, it's dark, with dingy red lighting almost to the point where you can't see your food or even the menu. It's a decent burger joint but nothing special. Service is pretty good with lots of seating options. The food is good but not great, it's also pretty pricey but some will argue that that's just London for you. You get a few options for fries but again, none really stand out as great. I had the buffalo fries that had blue cheese on them with a side of buffalo sauce. Being a big fan of blue cheese, I was disappointed with the tiny bit of blue cheese on top and it was £6!  The burgers are tasty but a little on the small side. I would say it's a good menu with chicken and beef choices/hot dogs with desserts and a drinks menu. Give it a try at least once and see for yourself but definitely better burger places out there.	having eaten here before  i knew where i was going but if you ve never been here before  one could mistake it for a brothel  just on the looks part  dark windows with signage and inside  it s dark  with dingy red lighting almost to the point where you can t see your food or even the menu  it s a decent burger joint but nothing special  service is pretty good with lots of seating options  the food is good but not great  it s also pretty pricey but some will argue that that s just london for you  you get a few options for fries but again  none really stand out as great  i had the buffalo fries that had blue cheese on them with a side of buffalo sauce  being a big fan of blue cheese  i was disappointed with the tiny bit of blue cheese on top and it was  6   the burgers are tasty but a little on the small side  i would say it s a good menu with chicken and beef choices hot dogs with desserts and a drinks menu  give it a try at least once and see for yourself but definitely better burger places out there

1895	3.0	So disappointing!! I have wanted to try Meat Liquor in forever and so was happy there was a restaurant nearby when out shopping. First impressions - that place is dark!! Luckily we were sat in a window seat so we could see our food. Following the advice of fellow Yelpers I went for the Dead Hippie, 2 French mustard beef patties and a portion of fries. Other people in my party had the cheeseburger and the chicken finger sandwich. I found my burger to be very moist, and juicy but in a bad way. It was a bit of a mess to eat actually and this isn't barbecue or pulled pork, so I didn't expect it. Maybe that's their thing, but I didn't rate the burger and have had much better burgers elsewhere. I also wasn't very impressed with the look of my friends chicken finger sandwich, it is served on white bread and it didn't look appetizing at all. My friend and I got a portion of fries each and I would definitely say you could share one portion between two as there was plenty. The food is served on a tray, like barbecue food is normally served, which I normally don't mind but when your food is dripping, it is difficult when you are sharing one tray between three not to get it everywhere.After my visit I kind of felt content that I hadn't been missing out all these years, like I thought I was as I hadn't visited Meat Liquor. I probably wouldn't object if someone I was with really wanted to eat there again, but I probably wouldn't seek it out myself to try again, there are too many options out there to try! Also it isn't the cheapest either, for the amount you get.	so disappointing   i have wanted to try meat liquor in forever and so was happy there was a restaurant nearby when out shopping  first impressions   that place is dark   luckily we were sat in a window seat so we could see our food  following the advice of fellow yelpers i went for the dead hippie  2 french mustard beef patties and a portion of fries  other people in my party had the cheeseburger and the chicken finger sandwich  i found my burger to be very moist  and juicy but in a bad way  it was a bit of a mess to eat actually and this isn t barbecue or pulled pork  so i didn t expect it  maybe that s their thing  but i didn t rate the burger and have had much better burgers elsewhere  i also wasn t very impressed with the look of my friends chicken finger sandwich  it is served on white bread and it didn t look appetizing at all  my friend and i got a portion of fries each and i would definitely say you could share one portion between two as there was plenty  the food is served on a tray  like barbecue food is normally served  which i normally don t mind but when your food is dripping  it is difficult when you are sharing one tray between three not to get it everywhere after my visit i kind of felt content that i hadn t been missing out all these years  like i thought i was as i hadn t visited meat liquor  i probably wouldn t object if someone i was with really wanted to eat there again  but i probably wouldn t seek it out myself to try again  there are too many options out there to try  also it isn t the cheapest either  for the amount you get

It wasn't messy, it wasn't juicy, and it wasn't very good. I'd rather have a burger from 5 Guys personally. The fries also weren't very good. I think they had been sitting out quite a while because when they got to me they were stale and lukewarm. Service wasn't great either, I had to flag down a waitress when my waiter disappeared. I definitely won't go back, even if it was an off day their consistency clearly leave a lot to be desired.	i really am shocked at all the good reviews  maybe i went on a bad day  i got a dead hippie burger and an order of fries  as opposed to most the photos my burger was fairly neat and orderly  it wasn t messy  it wasn t juicy  and it wasn t very good  i d rather have a burger from 5 guys personally  the fries also weren t very good  i think they had been sitting out quite a while because when they got to me they were stale and lukewarm  service wasn t great either  i had to flag down a waitress when my waiter disappeared  i definitely won t go back  even if it was an off day their consistency clearly leave a lot to be desired

1903	4.0	I've eaten at all the branches of the restaurant in London bar the Chicken place in Brixton, plus the good old Meat Easy, not to mention the original (well the second one) Wagon. So I'm used to the food by now, and that's one of the reasons why I keep coming back. Because if I started my experience with Meat Liquor then I probably wouldn't continue - since it's like walking into a darkened cupboard when you get inside. Thankfully on this occasion, we were seated over by the bar, so we had a little bit more ambient light than normal and direct access to the servers as they walked past (they're often difficult to attract in the permanent gloom). Having eaten here a fair few times, I've discovered that the best thing on the menu isn't actually the burgers - it's the monkey fingers. Seriously, if you like buffalo chicken, then you'll find that these are probably the best on the planet. Crunchy yet soft, with plenty of batter to act as a buffalo sauce delivery system to your tastebuds.I also tried the hippie fries for the first time - warning - do not order these on your own. The portion is so large that you'll never even look like you've dented them. You get a big dish of fries with runs of sauce and caramelised onions throughout. They're now on my list for when I'm not dining alone.As I said, the service here is usually hit and miss - but today was a hit. We got a good server, who was totally on the ball all the time. So good, that despite my policy of not tipping in the UK, I actually did leave a tip on this occasion.	i ve eaten at all the branches of the restaurant in london bar the chicken place in brixton  plus the good old meat easy  not to mention the original  well the second one  wagon  so i m used to the food by now  and that s one of the reasons why i keep coming back  because if i started my experience with meat liquor then i probably wouldn t continue   since it s like walking into a darkened cupboard when you get inside  thankfully on this occasion  we were seated over by the bar  so we had a little bit more ambient light than normal and direct access to the servers as they walked past  they re often difficult to attract in the permanent gloom   having eaten here a fair few times  i ve discovered that the best thing on the menu isn t actually the burgers   it s the monkey fingers  seriously  if you like buffalo chicken  then you ll find that these are probably the best on the planet  crunchy yet soft  with plenty of batter to act as a buffalo sauce delivery system to your tastebuds i also tried the hippie fries for the first time   warning   do not order these on your own  the portion is so large that you ll never even look like you ve dented them  you get a big dish of fries with runs of sauce and caramelised onions throughout  they re now on my list for when i m not dining alone as i said  the service here is usually hit and miss   but today was a hit  we got a good server  who was totally on the ball all the time  so good  that despite my policy of not tipping in the uk  i actually did leave a tip on this occasion 
1904	1.0	hippie has to be by far the worst burger i have ever had. Oversauced soggy buns, store bought chewy beef patties worse than Mcdonalds, and fries that were clealry from Tescos. If you cannot even cut your own potatoes, should you really call yourself a burger place? This was painful to eat and disgusting to watch. The fact that the place was jam packed with what seemed like tourists, tells us how bad food pallets really are.	hippie has to be by far the worst burger i have ever had  oversauced soggy buns  store bought chewy beef patties worse than mcdonalds  and fries that were clealry from tescos  if you cannot even cut your own potatoes  should you really call yourself a burger place  this was painful to eat and disgusting to watch  the fact that the place was jam packed with what seemed like tourists  tells us how bad food pallets really are 
1905	5.0	This has to be the coolest burger joint in London by a country mile, from the outside it is incredibly unassuming and once inside you are immersed in a cool and trendy world with awesome music and great aesthetic in terms of fantastic art on the walls and a great design idea. Me and three friends went on a sunday and had a range of things from the menu, I can thoroughly recommend the dead hippie burger with the hippie fried being a great addition. The onion rings are some of the best I've had and the deep friend Mac and cheese is great.

Honestly, some of the best food I've ever eaten and definitely in my top five for food in London. The food is served tray-style/family-style. It's really easy to taste your friends food this way. ;) I was really obsessed with their chicken sandwich. It' called the ""Tower Block Burger"". It has a fried chicken filet with cheese, hash brown, jalapenos, slaw, onions and a Russian dressing. By far the best chicken burger of my entire life. You will leave ML with a food baby and that is ok!! Also really love the deep fried mac & cheese and dead hippie burger. They have a nice bar + great drinks as well. This food really is SO good it should be a sin. Love Meatliquor forever and ever.P.S. They play super loud music, so not the best for a first date, get to know someone kind of thing. Come with other foodies who just want good bites and to take in the good vibes."	oh  meatiquor how i miss you dearly  even from across the pond i still dream of you  ml was my spot ok  this is the only location that i d ever been to and the food was amazing every time  honestly  some of the best food i ve ever eaten and definitely in my top five for food in london  the food is served tray style family style  it s really easy to taste your friends food this way     i was really obsessed with their chicken sandwich  it  called the  tower block burger   it has a fried chicken filet with cheese  hash brown  jalapenos  slaw  onions and a russian dressing  by far the best chicken burger of my entire life  you will leave ml with a food baby and that is ok   also really love the deep fried mac   cheese and dead hippie burger  they have a nice bar   great drinks as well  this food really is so good it should be a sin  love meatliquor forever and ever p s  they play super loud music  so not the best for a first date  get to know someone kind of thing  come with other foodies who just want good bites and to take in the good vibes 
1907	2.0	If you are looking for a greasy burger where the grease drips from your hands, Meat Liquor will be one of those places that will offer you that dirt. This place is not for the healthy soul! Nor is it a place for those looking for some peace because the music is really loud in every part of the restaurant. It is definitely not the place to go if you want to have a conversation where you do not want to be shouting.I have heard from others how long the queue but when we visited there was not a long queue. In minutes we got through the door in to the dark and noisy restaurant to wait at the bar. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of two people.All the food is served on a tray lined with a grease paper. The burger was not very pretty in presentation and it does make other fast food chain's burgers look better. The beef patty at Meat Liquor is moist and I love the melted cheese. But it was greasy and messy to eat.As well as a burger I tried a selection of sides - portion of fries, onion rings and deep-fried mac 'n' cheese. The onion rings were the biggest onion rings I have seen. Each one was in a crispy battered coating.	if you are looking for a greasy burger where the grease drips from your hands  meat liquor will be one of those places that will offer you that dirt  this place is not for the healthy soul  nor is it a place for those looking for some peace because the music is really loud in every part of the restaurant  it is definitely not the place to go if you want to have a conversation where you do not want to be shouting i have heard from others how long the queue but when we visited there was not a long queue  in minutes we got through the door in to the dark and noisy restaurant to wait at the bar  we waited around 15 minutes for a table of two people all the food is served on a tray lined with a grease paper  the burger was not very pretty in presentation and it does make other fast food chain s burgers look better  the beef patty at meat liquor is moist and i love the melted cheese  but it was greasy and messy to eat as well as a burger i tried a selection of sides   portion of fries  onion rings and deep fried mac  n  cheese  the onion rings were the biggest onion rings i have seen  each one was in a crispy battered coating

This is the closest thing I've found - to a very good one of those in the UK.It has a very good selection. Unless you're a veggie. But then you wouldn't be coming in probably. Anyway.I had the Dead Hippie Burger, Braai Wings and some onion rings. Washed down with a house grog. House grog they say, will only be served to you twice...think Zombie and you won't be far wrong. Pineapple, and lots of rum.All the food turned up at once on a tray, simple and effective. If you want a comparison for the burger, I'd say it's like an In-n-out California style double pattie job. Cooked the way I like it already (red in the middle) and served on a brioche bun, with pickles cheese and some tasty sauce.The onion rings were huge. Thick batter and a great amount of actual onion - not those reconstituted things you find at some places.The braii wings.Had I eaten one first, I think I would have just ordered a whole plate full. There's four of them, but they're a full wing, so it's like eight of your standard ""takeaway"" wings. BBQ'd and dry rubbed with an amazing spice mix - with an incredible dip.Meal was just under £30 all in, tip and £1 charity donation.Music was right up my street (rock and not too loud!) interior is...also. Dark, black and red with a host of pin up connotations.Servers and staff were all amazing.I'll be back. And then again.

1911	4.0	The food is fantastic! Greasy, deep fried deliciousness. I was surprised at how reasonably everything was priced as well. Honestly a bit dark inside, but I guess thats the atmosphere. We came on a Monday night so it was fairly quiet. The only thing was the service was awful. Our server barely spoke above a whisper and came over only once. Made it difficult to get the bill. When we did receive the bill, they had added on gratuity (we were a party 2... so thats not really fair) and a 'donation.' When I queried the server what the 'donation' was for, she said she wasn't sure. I obviously demanded it be taken off our bill as I will not be coerced into making a donation to something I dont even know. I also asked for the gratuity to be taken off, as its quite presumptuous to add that on. Being Canadian, I happily tip generously when I receive good service but I think its shameful for a restaurant to add automatic gratuities onto small parties - especially when the service is so painfully mediocre.	the food is fantastic  greasy  deep fried deliciousness  i was surprised at how reasonably everything was priced as well  honestly a bit dark inside  but i guess thats the atmosphere  we came on a monday night so it was fairly quiet  the only thing was the service was awful  our server barely spoke above a whisper and came over only once  made it difficult to get the bill  when we did receive the bill  they had added on gratuity  we were a party 2    so thats not really fair  and a  donation   when i queried the server what the  donation  was for  she said she wasn t sure  i obviously demanded it be taken off our bill as i will not be coerced into making a donation to something i dont even know  i also asked for the gratuity to be taken off  as its quite presumptuous to add that on  being canadian  i happily tip generously when i receive good service but i think its shameful for a restaurant to add automatic gratuities onto small parties   especially when the service is so painfully mediocre

1913	3.0	I'm currently on a quest to find the best burger in London, and happened to find myself close to the Meat Liquor around lunch time. Food: The burger was one of the best I've had. Succulent, perfectly cooked beef patty, and the extras were all decent/good. Plus for a perfectly sized bun that was sturdy enough to contain the burger+juices all the way through and didn't taste like plastic. The fries were basically McDonald's fries. Horrible and sad. Plus for the array of condiments on the table. Atmosphere: they're clearly going for ultra-casual, with scribbled-on and carved-up wooden beams and classroom chairs and stools. The weird thing is the tinted windows, which gives the whole place a dark, brooding feel which doesn't make you want to go in and doesn't rouse your appetite. Service: Friendly and helpful. Food came out relatively promptly. I asked for my burger without pickles and ketchup. It arrived without the latter, but with the former. One thing to change: the fries! Get us some real skin-on fries and maybe sweet potato fries as an alternative.	i m currently on a quest to find the best burger in london  and happened to find myself close to the meat liquor around lunch time  food  the burger was one of the best i ve had  succulent  perfectly cooked beef patty  and the extras were all decent good  plus for a perfectly sized bun that was sturdy enough to contain the burger juices all the way through and didn t taste like plastic  the fries were basically mcdonald s fries  horrible and sad  plus for the array of condiments on the table  atmosphere  they re clearly going for ultra casual  with scribbled on and carved up wooden beams and classroom chairs and stools  the weird thing is the tinted windows  which gives the whole place a dark  brooding feel which doesn t make you want to go in and doesn t rouse your appetite  service  friendly and helpful  food came out relatively promptly  i asked for my burger without pickles and ketchup  it arrived without the latter  but with the former  one thing to change  the fries  get us some real skin on fries and maybe sweet potato fries as an alternative

And that's what you get if you go to 'Meat Liquor'. I was a big fan of 'Meat Mission' already so I though: I'm sure it will be fine.We got a nice table, next to the bar. It is similar to  'Meat Mission': dark and loud (music is even louder there). I didn't care, I was in heaven. Burgers and booze everywhere! We ordered straight away. Service was fun and lovely! Our drinks and food in perfect time. Soooo gooood. We devoued our burgers and sides.I was really tired so we didn't stay long. It was really crowded and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun. Next time! I'll come back for sure.	do you like meat  this is your place then  saturday night  long shift at work  grumpy and hungry  not a happy alba  i was craving beer and meat  and that s what you get if you go to  meat liquor   i was a big fan of  meat mission  already so i though  i m sure it will be fine we got a nice table  next to the bar  it is similar to   meat mission   dark and loud  music is even louder there   i didn t care  i was in heaven  burgers and booze everywhere  we ordered straight away  service was fun and lovely  our drinks and food in perfect time  soooo gooood  we devoued our burgers and sides i was really tired so we didn t stay long  it was really crowded and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun  next time  i ll come back for sure

You and your friends definitely don't want to go there, as it's not worth waiting outside in the cold.Ehem.*I should probably mention that I am not particularly good at lying... the queue for this place on a friday night was already pretty long (and I really don't want it to get longer) ...so yes, this place is absolutely awful, and you shouldn't go there to make me have to wait longer for my meat!!Now I've got my lies out the way, this was easily the nicest burger of 2011. It was succulent, saucy and just delicious. I think all three of my friends agreed, as we all stopped talking for a while as we stuffed our faces with meaty joy. We loooved the fried pickles as well.The cocktails were pretty awesome too. It seems strange spending the same amount (or double) on cocktails as meat...but you can't really complain when they taste that good. Now, although this place serves 5 star burgers, it was pretty cold (bring a jumper!), the staff were a little hard to flag down, and the music was a bit too loud to be able to chat easily. I'm still going back though...the meat makes it worth it.	meat liqour is terrible  you and your friends definitely don t want to go there  as it s not worth waiting outside in the cold ehem  i should probably mention that i am not particularly good at lying    the queue for this place on a friday night was already pretty long  and i really don t want it to get longer     so yes  this place is absolutely awful  and you shouldn t go there to make me have to wait longer for my meat  now i ve got my lies out the way  this was easily the nicest burger of 2011  it was succulent  saucy and just delicious  i think all three of my friends agreed  as we all stopped talking for a while as we stuffed our faces with meaty joy  we loooved the fried pickles as well the cocktails were pretty awesome too  it seems strange spending the same amount  or double  on cocktails as meat   but you can t really complain when they taste that good  now  although this place serves 5 star burgers  it was pretty cold  bring a jumper    the staff were a little hard to flag down  and the music was a bit too loud to be able to chat easily  i m still going back though   the meat makes it worth it 
1916	4.0	Solid burger - it is a good burger joint. The patty is thick and sizable but what makes this burger is their at tension to the rest... Pickles are nice and thick, right amour of grease, good size bun with the right texture and slight sweetness... It is a really great combination of flavours and texture.We had hippi fries, cheese burger, bacon cheese burger and they were all great. Especially hippi fries... One of the few times I actually enjoyed paying extra on fries... This is if you like the flavour of sautéed onions. The only downside of the place for me is smell and lack of bright light. I understand that the venue is going for grunge look and feel but the place smells like old, stale bars... With no burger smell! Also it is too dark for me... Call me old school but I prefer enough lights to see what I am exactly eating.	solid burger   it is a good burger joint  the patty is thick and sizable but what makes this burger is their at tension to the rest    pickles are nice and thick  right amour of grease  good size bun with the right texture and slight sweetness    it is a really great combination of flavours and texture we had hippi fries  cheese burger  bacon cheese burger and they were all great  especially hippi fries    one of the few times i actually enjoyed paying extra on fries    this is if you like the flavour of saut ed onions  the only downside of the place for me is smell and lack of bright light  i understand that the venue is going for grunge look and feel but the place smells like old  stale bars    with no burger smell  also it is too dark for me    call me old school but i prefer enough lights to see what i am exactly eating

1922	4.0	Arrived 7:30PM on a Saturday night - 1 hour wait.Departure 2.5 hours later, fully stuffed with unhealthiness.I took a big whiff of myself and I REEKED of hamburger.Yup, that Meat Liquor got me. Good thing I took the night off drinking or else I would've had a double whammy of stankiness, that is... the wonderful bodily scent of hamburger all over me from my head down to my toes and alcohol breath. Sounds hot, doesn't it?Sorry if I've officially grossed you out from coming here, but in a way that's good because if I ever decide to go again, hopefully the queue will be shorter and I wouldn't have to wait as long. :)After waiting outside for an hour, my friend and I finally made it inside. This place was a little too hipster for Marylebone. I definitely felt as if it belonged in Shoreditch but I loved the vibe nonetheless. It was awesome. Loud music. Crazy people. Dirty, greasy unhealthy food. Pure Awesomeness.So what did I order? Bingo wings aka buffalo wings. Pretty good if I do say so myself. Could've used a little more of a spicy kick though. Mushroom Swiss Burger. Why did I do this to myself? I got through a little more than half before I waved my white flag. 2 meat patties, double cheese... I could barely bite into it and yes, it got all over the place and I was a hot mess. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger and I think he enjoyed it as well. We also got 2 root beer floats (brown cows) to wash it all down. The verdict? If I'm craving a burger, it isn't bad but I wasn't in love with my Mushroom Swiss. The meat was juicy and had good flavor so I think there's potential if I go with a different kind of burger next time. I love the atmosphere so that's another plus for me. My suggestion is to go early or go late. By the time we left the queue was non-existent but that was after 10PM. You'll smell so good after you eat here that the people you walk by on the street will want to eat you. ;)	arrived 7 30pm on a saturday night   1 hour wait departure 2 5 hours later  fully stuffed with unhealthiness i took a big whiff of myself and i reeked of hamburger yup  that meat liquor got me  good thing i took the night off drinking or else i would ve had a double whammy of stankiness  that is    the wonderful bodily scent of hamburger all over me from my head down to my toes and alcohol breath  sounds hot  doesn t it sorry if i ve officially grossed you out from coming here  but in a way that s good because if i ever decide to go again  hopefully the queue will be shorter and i wouldn t have to wait as long    after waiting outside for an hour  my friend and i finally made it inside  this place was a little too hipster for marylebone  i definitely felt as if it belonged in shoreditch but i loved the vibe nonetheless  it was awesome  loud music  crazy people  dirty  greasy unhealthy food  pure awesomeness so what did i order  bingo wings aka buffalo wings  pretty good if i do say so myself  could ve used a little more of a spicy kick though  mushroom swiss burger  why did i do this to myself  i got through a little more than half before i waved my white flag  2 meat patties  double cheese    i could barely bite into it and yes  it got all over the place and i was a hot mess  my friend ordered the buffalo chicken burger and i think he enjoyed it as well  we also got 2 root beer floats  brown cows  to wash it all down  the verdict  if i m craving a burger  it isn t bad but i wasn t in love with my mushroom swiss  the meat was juicy and had good flavor so i think there s potential if i go with a different kind of burger next time  i love the atmosphere so that s another plus for me  my suggestion is to go early or go late  by the time we left the queue was non existent but that was after 10pm  you ll smell so good after you eat here that the people you walk by on the street will want to eat you    
1923	5.0	Loveeeeee this place, came across it a few years ago just behind selfridges, and since then i have been going back time and time again. Yes it is a little dark inside, but the food is impeccable. Large portions, value for money, proper american style burgers, loaded fries, battered pickles, simply the best mouth watering binge eating you will experience. The milkshakes are also yummmy. If you can't eat it all in 1 sitting, ask for a doggy bag, its well worth it :)Be sure to get there quick, otherwise there will be a queue outside, which is definitely worth the wait.	loveeeeee this place  came across it a few years ago just behind selfridges  and since then i have been going back time and time again  yes it is a little dark inside  but the food is impeccable  large portions  value for money  proper american style burgers  loaded fries  battered pickles  simply the best mouth watering binge eating you will experience  the milkshakes are also yummmy  if you can t eat it all in 1 sitting  ask for a doggy bag  its well worth it   be sure to get there quick  otherwise there will be a queue outside  which is definitely worth the wait 
1924	3.0	"My fingers reek of onions (in a good way..maybe not to the person next to me on the bus) but that's not gonna stop me from writing my review. I don't think I need to speak for the food in detail.  The chilli fries may not be for everyone, even though I managed to finish off my half (and I'll be running another 10km to shed my guilt).  I haven't managed to try too many burger places, but at this rate I prefer Honest Burgers over my Dead Hippie burger. Seems lots of people love it, but the dead hippie sauce was a sad mess of warm greasy mayo. Its also incredibly dark in there, so its hard to see your food.  I was too hungry to determine whether my patty was cooked properly or not.. is this why its so dark in here??Overall, the food is 3.5 stars, but I've lowered the overall experience down to 3 stars for the following reasons: - it was far too loud to talk to anyone. we had to keep shouting into each others ear- we sat in the centre, where there was a domed ceiling that echoed everything we said.  It even echoed the conversation from diners across from us - and I really didn't need to hear about their sore boobs.  - the portions of slaw are quite generous for £3, so we had an extra (untouched) serving left.  I asked the waitress if we could it packed up, but she gave me attitude,  ""I don't know"". I explained it was good, but we ordered too much, she said the chefs are busy but she will ask. She did come back with a bag, promptly dropped it off and said ""I did it myself"" with a stone cold face and walked away, even though I beamed a smile and said thanks so much.

You are now one of them. Happily consuming 2,000 calories in one meal. The music pumping into your ears tells you it's ok ... go on ... do it ... shhh, just eat the deep fried mac & cheese. Just put it in your mouth like a good girl. Wait, that just went too far.	so this is how some devilish  voodoo  new orleans underground cult would make a burger  it s dark  it s loud  and the dead hippy s meaty juices act like an elixir to control your mind  you are now one of them  happily consuming 2 000 calories in one meal  the music pumping into your ears tells you it s ok     go on     do it     shhh  just eat the deep fried mac   cheese  just put it in your mouth like a good girl  wait  that just went too far 
1926	3.0	The food is good, but I would recommend fasting before and after you come here because it's all VERY greasy. But if you're looking for something salty and fatty, this is the place!We came here on a Saturday around 5:30p and had to queue for about a half hour. The line grew very quickly so I'd recommend coming earlier rather than later. The queuing experience was surprisingly pleasant because they offered us onion rings and fried pickles! (I'd recommend the pickles.)We ordered the cheeseburger, cheese fries, and wings. Everything was salty and a teeny bit overly soggy. The wings were really good and the portion was quite generous. If I return, I'd skip the cheese fries because they were soft and the cheddar had completely solidified over the fries. As for the burger, I prefer Honest Burger over Meat Liquor's.	the food is good  but i would recommend fasting before and after you come here because it s all very greasy  but if you re looking for something salty and fatty  this is the place we came here on a saturday around 5 30p and had to queue for about a half hour  the line grew very quickly so i d recommend coming earlier rather than later  the queuing experience was surprisingly pleasant because they offered us onion rings and fried pickles   i d recommend the pickles  we ordered the cheeseburger  cheese fries  and wings  everything was salty and a teeny bit overly soggy  the wings were really good and the portion was quite generous  if i return  i d skip the cheese fries because they were soft and the cheddar had completely solidified over the fries  as for the burger  i prefer honest burger over meat liquor s

It's expensive though for what it really is. Lunch for one (yes, sad, I know...) came to £21, with £3 of that being service and donations that they just add on.Still, a must try if you're into quality burgers!	food s great and good service  i was recommended the shredded steak which was absolutely perfect  also with that i had the cheesy chips and slaw  and a root beer  it s expensive though for what it really is  lunch for one  yes  sad  i know     came to  21  with  3 of that being service and donations that they just add on still  a must try if you re into quality burgers 
1928	2.0	After my colleagues ranted and raved about this place I grabbed my Burger-buddy and made a date of it. Firstly the decor is amazing, slaughterhouse style with a hint of Vaudeville. It was very dark and I could easily imagine a party coming from Torture Garden to dine here before heading off to play with toys similar to the decorations.We were lucky in that as there were only two of us we had only a 25 minutes wait, and doubly lucky that we were allowed to wait inside at the bar. The cocktails are great, a little bit pricey, even for this part of London, but well made. Sadly it took me 15 minutes to catch the bar-staffs eyes there were two of them behind the bar doing nothing, just talking to each other whilst one guy worked the waiting crowd. When we were shown to our table and ordered our food arrived quickly but the staff were inattentive, possibly due to the large number of people wanting to eat here. The chips were divine, but the burgers were disappointing a little too greasy and over-cooked. My burger-buddy and I were comparing it to other burger bars in the area and it came up short. - However it is apparently open 'til the early hours and so after a night out my attitude towards it might have changed.	after my colleagues ranted and raved about this place i grabbed my burger buddy and made a date of it  firstly the decor is amazing  slaughterhouse style with a hint of vaudeville  it was very dark and i could easily imagine a party coming from torture garden to dine here before heading off to play with toys similar to the decorations we were lucky in that as there were only two of us we had only a 25 minutes wait  and doubly lucky that we were allowed to wait inside at the bar  the cocktails are great  a little bit pricey  even for this part of london  but well made  sadly it took me 15 minutes to catch the bar staffs eyes there were two of them behind the bar doing nothing  just talking to each other whilst one guy worked the waiting crowd  when we were shown to our table and ordered our food arrived quickly but the staff were inattentive  possibly due to the large number of people wanting to eat here  the chips were divine  but the burgers were disappointing a little too greasy and over cooked  my burger buddy and i were comparing it to other burger bars in the area and it came up short    however it is apparently open  til the early hours and so after a night out my attitude towards it might have changed 
1929	4.0	Still on my hunt for the best burger of London, I decided to try Meatliquor on Saturday night. I had high expectations for this place, as I was bringing some friends with me and wanted them to have a great time ! But Meatliquor didn't disappoint !The atmosphere is really funny and unconventional : it's dark and edgy, with a lot of photobooth pictures, writing on the walls, red lights, neon sign lights... Here, you don't just eat a burger, you embrace the place !Because everything seemed so delicious, we shared a lot of our plates. So I got to try the chili cheese fries, the hippie fries, the mac'n'cheese for the sides, and I had a red chili burger for the main. Everything was delicious ! My favourite sides were the mac'n'cheese and the chili cheese fries, which were a perfect match with my burger ! Yes, I love a good beef chili in my fries and burger ;)I really wanted to try the milkshakes (especially the White Russian) but I was already full. Next time ?The only thing that annoyed me a little, is the fact that we had to speak really loud to understand each other. Part of the atmosphere I guess !	still on my hunt for the best burger of london  i decided to try meatliquor on saturday night  i had high expectations for this place  as i was bringing some friends with me and wanted them to have a great time   but meatliquor didn t disappoint  the atmosphere is really funny and unconventional   it s dark and edgy  with a lot of photobooth pictures  writing on the walls  red lights  neon sign lights    here  you don t just eat a burger  you embrace the place  because everything seemed so delicious  we shared a lot of our plates  so i got to try the chili cheese fries  the hippie fries  the mac n cheese for the sides  and i had a red chili burger for the main  everything was delicious   my favourite sides were the mac n cheese and the chili cheese fries  which were a perfect match with my burger   yes  i love a good beef chili in my fries and burger   i really wanted to try the milkshakes  especially the white russian  but i was already full  next time  the only thing that annoyed me a little  is the fact that we had to speak really loud to understand each other  part of the atmosphere i guess  
1930	4.0	We visited early evening on a Monday. We found the service to be great and found our server to be friendly and helpful and attentive. The place was pretty empty so even though the music was loud, we didn't have to compete with loads of voices either. The music was varied and fitted the arty/moody exterior. Right up our street :)Usually when somewhere has a lot of hype and is popular we try and visit at a time when it's less likely to be busy. You can't really complain after getting drawn in to the popularity of a place.I'm from Sarf London so for drinks I ordered the Peckham Terminator ( which looked suitably girly - nice touch) and the New Cross Negroni. My husband ordered a Bourbon and Black - a boozy coke float. We were offered a jug of water without having to ask which is a small but impressive gesture. Usually you have to ask and it's brought over begrudgingly.Food wise he chose the red chilli and I decided to try my first cheesesteak - Mushroom cheese steak. We both enjoyed our choices. I particularly liked the steamed bun nature of mine. It was huge though so my husband finished it off for me.For sides we ordered the cheese fries and fried pickles. Controversially I think our faves were the sides which were even better then we expected - especially the pickles which had the perfect batter.	we visited early evening on a monday  we found the service to be great and found our server to be friendly and helpful and attentive  the place was pretty empty so even though the music was loud  we didn t have to compete with loads of voices either  the music was varied and fitted the arty moody exterior  right up our street   usually when somewhere has a lot of hype and is popular we try and visit at a time when it s less likely to be busy  you can t really complain after getting drawn in to the popularity of a place i m from sarf london so for drinks i ordered the peckham terminator   which looked suitably girly   nice touch  and the new cross negroni  my husband ordered a bourbon and black   a boozy coke float  we were offered a jug of water without having to ask which is a small but impressive gesture  usually you have to ask and it s brought over begrudgingly food wise he chose the red chilli and i decided to try my first cheesesteak   mushroom cheese steak  we both enjoyed our choices  i particularly liked the steamed bun nature of mine  it was huge though so my husband finished it off for me for sides we ordered the cheese fries and fried pickles  controversially i think our faves were the sides which were even better then we expected   especially the pickles which had the perfect batter 
1931	4.0	Good burger, really good. Tasty and well done. I tried the dead hippie burger. The patty has a mustard sauce with lots if spices. It has a lot if flavor but the burger itself is really small. They have chili fries and they are really good. The fries themselves are really boring. Have a root beer float, it's delicious and goes well with the burger.	good burger  really good  tasty and well done  i tried the dead hippie burger  the patty has a mustard sauce with lots if spices  it has a lot if flavor but the burger itself is really small  they have chili fries and they are really good  the fries themselves are really boring  have a root beer float  it s delicious and goes well with the burger

1935	3.0	"Been to this joint twice, and one things for certain - it's consistent. The good - the burgers are decent (albeit super greasy), the hours are late, it's unpretentiousness and they've a nice drink selection. The bad - as mentioned above, the food is uber greasy, yeah I know it's a burger and fries joint, but you'll taste and feel of grease for hours afterwards. The fries are under seasoned, which is kind of amazing considering they have 4-5 different styles of toppings (e.g. Green chilli, cheese etc.), but they make the simple and cardinal sin of now simply salting the fries out of the fryer - the result being a tasteless and greasy ""dry"" fry when you don't have any topping. Yuck. Now the ugly - the service. It's just plain awful, no other way to put it. Both visits me and my companions have experienced different sorts of terrible service here. Essentially, a fine place to come to load up on grease and have a late night drink. Don't expect to be wowed (funny as you see a number of folks photographing the food!), but it'll fill you up without busting your wallet. Better yet, go when you find a 50% off food voucher (as we did on our second visit), but still double check your bill (refer to service comment above!)."	been to this joint twice  and one things for certain   it s consistent  the good   the burgers are decent  albeit super greasy   the hours are late  it s unpretentiousness and they ve a nice drink selection  the bad   as mentioned above  the food is uber greasy  yeah i know it s a burger and fries joint  but you ll taste and feel of grease for hours afterwards  the fries are under seasoned  which is kind of amazing considering they have 4 5 different styles of toppings  e g  green chilli  cheese etc    but they make the simple and cardinal sin of now simply salting the fries out of the fryer   the result being a tasteless and greasy  dry  fry when you don t have any topping  yuck  now the ugly   the service  it s just plain awful  no other way to put it  both visits me and my companions have experienced different sorts of terrible service here  essentially  a fine place to come to load up on grease and have a late night drink  don t expect to be wowed  funny as you see a number of folks photographing the food    but it ll fill you up without busting your wallet  better yet  go when you find a 50  off food voucher  as we did on our second visit   but still double check your bill  refer to service comment above   
1936	3.0	Sorry, but I don't get the hype. The burgers are ok, but they won't blow you away. I would prefer to give Meat Liquor 2.5 stars... because it's slightly better than their sister-restaurant Meat Market, but not by much. As with Meat Market, the burger here was pretty standard. I had the Dead Hippie burger due to rave reviews and the sauce was delicious, but I've had better. The french fries (not chips, as the menu rightly states) were nice and crispy, but the cheese fries just WERE NOT cheese fries, not by any American's standards at least. They were fries with shredded cheese melted on top so that it forms that layer of congealed cheese that is hard to break apart, you know what I mean? Sorry, but that's not cheese fries. We also had the fried pickles and onion rings as sides. I'm not a huge pickles fan, so can't really comment, but the rings were good. Topping it all off, I had a root beer float (called something else on the menu and it was in the desert section but I had it as my drink) and it was delicious.Lastly, the ambiance is a bit strange. Really cool if you're looking for a dingy,low-key bar to hang out in. But Meat Liquor is a restaurant, not a bar, and I like to see my food when I eat, so I wasn't really digging the low lighting and the crazy decor. Just my preference.All in all, Meat Liquor's an ok place but not worth the wait in my eyes.	sorry  but i don t get the hype  the burgers are ok  but they won t blow you away  i would prefer to give meat liquor 2 5 stars    because it s slightly better than their sister restaurant meat market  but not by much  as with meat market  the burger here was pretty standard  i had the dead hippie burger due to rave reviews and the sauce was delicious  but i ve had better  the french fries  not chips  as the menu rightly states  were nice and crispy  but the cheese fries just were not cheese fries  not by any american s standards at least  they were fries with shredded cheese melted on top so that it forms that layer of congealed cheese that is hard to break apart  you know what i mean  sorry  but that s not cheese fries  we also had the fried pickles and onion rings as sides  i m not a huge pickles fan  so can t really comment  but the rings were good  topping it all off  i had a root beer float  called something else on the menu and it was in the desert section but i had it as my drink  and it was delicious lastly  the ambiance is a bit strange  really cool if you re looking for a dingy low key bar to hang out in  but meat liquor is a restaurant  not a bar  and i like to see my food when i eat  so i wasn t really digging the low lighting and the crazy decor  just my preference all in all  meat liquor s an ok place but not worth the wait in my eyes 
1937	4.0	It's very much a hate it or love it place (and I love it). I'll always remember by first time here. It was during that night of random heavy snowfall in February 2012 and I foolishly walked from my flat (then near Great Portland Street) thinking the weather didn't seem that bad (I was wrong) and waited outside for an hour in extremely adverse weather conditions. Anyway,..Ambiance:Loud, noisy, aggressive, weird. I actually find the interior a bit overpowering. There's a certain time (around 8ish maybe) where they turn up the music significantly, and I find it much more enjoyable coming before that time. Anyway, it's very much an experience.Cocktails:Extensive cocktail menu. Fairly standard pricing (ranges from around 7-10 pounds). I've tried a bunch, they're all pretty well made but no huge standouts. The 'house grog' comes with a 2 per person limit, but I had two once and while undoubtedly strong, didn't think it was particularly so. Likewise, all the drinks while good definitely are fairly average on the alcohol content.Food:Not the best burger but I find the patties to be a good size, meaty, tender and well-seasoned. Can't ask for much more than that. Many people rave about the dead hippie burger. It features some sort of mayo based sauce which I don't think it anything special. My favs are the mushroom swiss and the normal cheeseburger. The burgers are the perfect size imo. Filling and easy to eat.Sides:The deep fried pickles are an absolute must (if you like pickles). I find the chilli cheese fries too heavy. One thing that always annoyed me was that they initially only had plain fries or the meaty cheese fries but they didn't have on the menu, and explicitly refused to do, just cheese fries. Fortunately, (presumably because enough people asked) they have since added normal cheese fries to their menu (though I have yet to try them)Notes:Yes the lines get ridiculous. After the first time, I've yet to wait more than 30 mins because I try and go off peak. And as much as I love it, I don't think it justifies an hour wait (unless you have yet to try it of course in which case go try it asap regardless of the wait!)	it s very much a hate it or love it place  and i love it   i ll always remember by first time here  it was during that night of random heavy snowfall in february 2012 and i foolishly walked from my flat  then near great portland street  thinking the weather didn t seem that bad  i was wrong  and waited outside for an hour in extremely adverse weather conditions  anyway   ambiance loud  noisy  aggressive  weird  i actually find the interior a bit overpowering  there s a certain time  around 8ish maybe  where they turn up the music significantly  and i find it much more enjoyable coming before that time  anyway  it s very much an experience cocktails extensive cocktail menu  fairly standard pricing  ranges from around 7 10 pounds   i ve tried a bunch  they re all pretty well made but no huge standouts  the  house grog  comes with a 2 per person limit  but i had two once and while undoubtedly strong  didn t think it was particularly so  likewise  all the drinks while good definitely are fairly average on the alcohol content food not the best burger but i find the patties to be a good size  meaty  tender and well seasoned  can t ask for much more than that  many people rave about the dead hippie burger  it features some sort of mayo based sauce which i don t think it anything special  my favs are the mushroom swiss and the normal cheeseburger  the burgers are the perfect size imo  filling and easy to eat sides the deep fried pickles are an absolute must  if you like pickles   i find the chilli cheese fries too heavy  one thing that always annoyed me was that they initially only had plain fries or the meaty cheese fries but they didn t have on the menu  and explicitly refused to do  just cheese fries  fortunately   presumably because enough people asked  they have since added normal cheese fries to their menu  though i have yet to try them notes yes the lines get ridiculous  after the first time  i ve yet to wait more than 30 mins because i try and go off peak  and as much as i love it  i don t think it justifies an hour wait  unless you have yet to try it of course in which case go try it asap regardless of the wait

We came here on a whim so joined the traditionally long queue, as expected in London, but it didn't take long before we were ushered in. The club, sorry restaurant, is very dark. We felt like we were entering a cave. The whole place is wildly decorated, like the lovechild of Dracula and Marilyn Manson, with blood spattering the walls and animal parts everywhere.This was all coupled with the traditional Americana we have come to expect; a trendy diner come restaurant with booming rock n' roll music drowning out the chatter.The place was packed so we started at the bar. After a few cocktails of the Cyder Car, Fallen Angelita and Space Gin Smash our table was ready!I went for the hippie fries (I have no idea what was in the hippie sauce) along with a Bacon Cheeseburger.

1939	4.0	Sooo I'd been waiting to go to one of the Meat Liquor branches for a long time and a few weeks ago bf and I popped in to Meat Market in CG and bloomin loved it so went away vowing to try their other branches!Low and behold I get an email over bank holiday weekend offering 50% off on Tuesday 26th to beat those post bank holiday blues! Well boy did they!?It was a toss up between Meat Liquor or Meat Mission but we decided to Meat Liquor (closer to home and reviews on Yelp swayed me)I've heard queues can get ridiculous so we rocked up pretty early at 6. It was getting busy but we were seated straight away.Man is it dark and noisy but you know what I liked it even though I couldn't hear my bf half the time.Unlike Meat Market, there is table service, staff were friendly and service was reasonably quick.Well the food was amazing! I had the bacon and cheese burger - soooo good, especially the bacon! Bf had the red chilli burger which he liked but preferred mine! I tried the chilli - was delish but a bit spicy for me. We also got onion rings (the biggest and crispest you ever did see), coleslaw (to be healthy) and Mac and cheese bites to share. Best Onion rings I've ever had (no lie) and I bloomin love the Mac and cheese. Menu is slightly different here (less burger choice) and also there is a side (monkey fingers) I want to try from Meat Mission so will definitely be going there next - if my heart can take it!They also don't do puddings which is a shame however I was so insanely full it shouldn't have mattered!In all came to £30 with a cocktail and 2 beers (50% off food) and tip - not bad seeing as I could barely roll home!	sooo i d been waiting to go to one of the meat liquor branches for a long time and a few weeks ago bf and i popped in to meat market in cg and bloomin loved it so went away vowing to try their other branches low and behold i get an email over bank holiday weekend offering 50  off on tuesday 26th to beat those post bank holiday blues  well boy did they  it was a toss up between meat liquor or meat mission but we decided to meat liquor  closer to home and reviews on yelp swayed me i ve heard queues can get ridiculous so we rocked up pretty early at 6  it was getting busy but we were seated straight away man is it dark and noisy but you know what i liked it even though i couldn t hear my bf half the time unlike meat market  there is table service  staff were friendly and service was reasonably quick well the food was amazing  i had the bacon and cheese burger   soooo good  especially the bacon  bf had the red chilli burger which he liked but preferred mine  i tried the chilli   was delish but a bit spicy for me  we also got onion rings  the biggest and crispest you ever did see   coleslaw  to be healthy  and mac and cheese bites to share  best onion rings i ve ever had  no lie  and i bloomin love the mac and cheese  menu is slightly different here  less burger choice  and also there is a side  monkey fingers  i want to try from meat mission so will definitely be going there next   if my heart can take it they also don t do puddings which is a shame however i was so insanely full it shouldn t have mattered in all came to  30 with a cocktail and 2 beers  50  off food  and tip   not bad seeing as i could barely roll home 
1940	5.0	"Arrive hungry, leave drunk"". That's the tagline for this restaurant so it's really no wonder that's it's one of my favourites! The other thing I love about MEATLiquor is the fact that despite all the hysteria around 2 hour queues around the street for a table - every time I've been, I've walked straight in and been seated! (Sundays afternoons seem to work a charm!).As soon as you walk through the front doors, you're plunged into a dark, domed room complete with red lighting, wrought iron pillars, and sinister illustrations of owls, wolves and skulls adorning the walls. It's not for the faint-hearted and it's not very camera friendly but the food itself more than makes up for that! I actually quite like the vibe of the restaurant, it feels like a real hardened bar where you'd expect to find some seasoned drinkers glugging bourbon out the back and MEATLiquor seem keen to indulge that vision with  an impressive drinks menu to match. I always go for the fabulously named 'Donkey Punch' - vodka served over cubed ice with a dash of Absinthe and topped with spicy ginger beer, a dash of bitters and fresh lime.Meat Liquor is my idea of heaven with a hangover - I can only go following a night of drinking when all plans of calorie counting go out the window and I can feast on all the meaty, cheesiness goodness I desire! The tables each have a roll of kitchen towel plonked on them so you know this is a place for feasting. The dead hippie burger seems to be the sweetheart of the restaurant, but my favourite option is always the buffalo chicken burger. I can honestly say it is the best burger I've ever eaten (and I'm a beef kind of girl) - the combination of the hot sauce/ blue cheese and the crunchy batter is simply out of this world.Remember fries are made for sharing - and the chilli cheese fries in themselves are a meal! A huge mass of potato fries heaped with flavoursome chilli, melted cheese and chopped jalapenos - order these to share or face a man versus food challenge if you so wish!"	arrive hungry  leave drunk   that s the tagline for this restaurant so it s really no wonder that s it s one of my favourites  the other thing i love about meatliquor is the fact that despite all the hysteria around 2 hour queues around the street for a table   every time i ve been  i ve walked straight in and been seated   sundays afternoons seem to work a charm   as soon as you walk through the front doors  you re plunged into a dark  domed room complete with red lighting  wrought iron pillars  and sinister illustrations of owls  wolves and skulls adorning the walls  it s not for the faint hearted and it s not very camera friendly but the food itself more than makes up for that  i actually quite like the vibe of the restaurant  it feels like a real hardened bar where you d expect to find some seasoned drinkers glugging bourbon out the back and meatliquor seem keen to indulge that vision with  an impressive drinks menu to match  i always go for the fabulously named  donkey punch    vodka served over cubed ice with a dash of absinthe and topped with spicy ginger beer  a dash of bitters and fresh lime meat liquor is my idea of heaven with a hangover   i can only go following a night of drinking when all plans of calorie counting go out the window and i can feast on all the meaty  cheesiness goodness i desire  the tables each have a roll of kitchen towel plonked on them so you know this is a place for feasting  the dead hippie burger seems to be the sweetheart of the restaurant  but my favourite option is always the buffalo chicken burger  i can honestly say it is the best burger i ve ever eaten  and i m a beef kind of girl    the combination of the hot sauce  blue cheese and the crunchy batter is simply out of this world remember fries are made for sharing   and the chilli cheese fries in themselves are a meal  a huge mass of potato fries heaped with flavoursome chilli  melted cheese and chopped jalapenos   order these to share or face a man versus food challenge if you so wish

1942	4.0	Be warned, you're going to make a mess when you eat at MeatLiquor! But worry not, as there are rolls of kitchen paper towels on each table. Greasy goodness, but not the type you end up regretting an hour later, the type that feels like it's giving your tummy a big warm hug. I had the fried chicken smothered in gooey cheese in a bun. It really hit the spot! Their cocktails are pretty tasty too. This place does get very busy with queues out the door, but somehow we managed to get a table straight away on a Friday night after work, so you might get lucky.	be warned  you re going to make a mess when you eat at meatliquor  but worry not  as there are rolls of kitchen paper towels on each table  greasy goodness  but not the type you end up regretting an hour later  the type that feels like it s giving your tummy a big warm hug  i had the fried chicken smothered in gooey cheese in a bun  it really hit the spot  their cocktails are pretty tasty too  this place does get very busy with queues out the door  but somehow we managed to get a table straight away on a friday night after work  so you might get lucky

I also had a shake, it was delicious but extremely sweet! The atmosphere is great, its very different from your average burger bar, its quite dark, with red lights and grunge style decor, with a photo booth in the centre. Its a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach!	overall i really liked meatliquor  as long as you go prepared for a heart attack on a plate  well a tray  then you ll know what to expect  american style food  burgers  wings  chilli dogs  chilli fries and all smothered in cheese  i also had a shake  it was delicious but extremely sweet  the atmosphere is great  its very different from your average burger bar  its quite dark  with red lights and grunge style decor  with a photo booth in the centre  its a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach 
1944	4.0	"One day I was waxing on about how this American Werewolf has not found REAL hot wings and chunky blue cheese dressing anywhere in London on an unusually homesick day. A helpful cubicle gopher popped up and yelled out MeatLiquor in an almost Pavlovian response. This was quite a hike from our offices, but I was promised was worth it.The interior is dark and as a previous reviewer mentioned, masculine grunge is the correct description with fantastic archaic music. It is so dark that I hate to admit required the ""torch"" feature of my smart phone to read the menu. Disappointed they only serve canned beer, my concerns were swept away as I surveyed a board of fare reminiscent of an Old Southern Dive. Having been stationed in South Carolina for several years, I think I know what a southern dive looks, smells, and tastes like...I have been to Meat Liquor twice now, and I have had the same thing, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, slathered in REAL chunky blue cheese dressing.

Back then, it already had quite a cult following, serving the same good ol' greasy, tasty, heartfelt food. Fast forward (maybe) three years later and here we are! Admittedly, I am VERY late on this review game but LOOK AT THAT LITTLE WAGON THAT COULD!! Oh you make me smile :')There's something incredibly visceral about this place. The loud music, the way your voice echoes if seated under the dome, the soft splotching of fried batter covered in buffalo sauce as it falls on the paper-lined tray. And of course, the grease running between your fingers, the grease on your cheek, the sauce trying to escape everywhere and of course all of that goodness making merry in your mouth. You'd never be more thankful for kitchen towels.Buffalo chicken burger. YES. Deep fried pickles. YES. Onion rings. YES. Chilli fries. YES. Mushroom swiss burger. YES. Dead hippie burger. YES. Chilli dog. YES.I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD SAY!Feel like Meat Liquor is the sort of place you have to visit (even if just once). And not because it's popular or 'cause of the hype.

1946	4.0	"If you want meat and you want it now, get down here asap - MeatLiquor is an experience and certainly one that shouldn't be missed, especially for burger fans. Given burgers don't sit at the top of my food agenda, I delayed coming here amongst all the hype it had a few months ago, but I luckily decided enough was enough, and I grabbed lunch on a quiet(ish) Tuesday lunchtime. The decor is enough to set your tastebuds to the moon and back, old American-style bar scene with iron clad bars and exposed timber. Bench, booth and stool seating with a nice bit of room over by the bar to knock a few pickle-backs in the gullet. We were seated right in the middle of the action, louder than average but a really nice fun vibe. The menu is vast and filled to the brim with burgers of all variations, and I mean ALL variations. The list is crammed with different ingredients, everything from halloumi, red onions, pepper sauce and mustard-fried patties - excellent! After a great punchy suffolk cider, I wanted nothing but the ""Dirty Chicken"" burger in front of me. I jumped in on some slaw to also sweeten the deal. Not much of a wait later, this absolute beast of a chicken burger landed on my table. Huge, almost glowing buns cover one of the best fried chicken slabs I've ever laid eyes on. The usual suspects of lettuce, tomato and onions were also stuffed right on in there...Lost in the atmosphere of EAT EVERYTHING NOW (Angry Face), I lifted the top bun and shoved the slaw right in...First bite, wow, second bite, double-wow and by the 5th it was gone. WHAT a chicken burger and it's up there with the best in the city! Outside of the burgers, the menu is filled with amazing sides including deep fried pickles, cheese fries and onion rings. And then there's the adult-only milkshakes. I mean where else can you get a Jager and vanilla shake! This place is awesome, a real in-your-face place to enjoy a couple of stiff drinks and tasty hearty food. It's perfect for a group of mates or colleagues to kick back and get loose. So leave your diets at your desk and don't worry about the huge lines outside, this place is more than worth it.

1947	3.0	Meat Liquor usually tops everyone's list of top burgers in London. I left a bit underwhelmed. On my third attempt to get inside (the other times the queues were 1-1.5 hours long), I finally made into the mecca of all things meat. It's very loud and dark inside, and the decor can only be described as an hipster slaughter house. As for the burger....I got a double patty artery clogging delight... certainly good, but was it worth the hype and endless queues, uh not really. This is one greasy burger. Note, the proprietors also operate Meat Market in Covent Garden...same exact burgers minus the slaughter house vibe and less of a queue.	meat liquor usually tops everyone s list of top burgers in london  i left a bit underwhelmed  on my third attempt to get inside  the other times the queues were 1 1 5 hours long   i finally made into the mecca of all things meat  it s very loud and dark inside  and the decor can only be described as an hipster slaughter house  as for the burger    i got a double patty artery clogging delight    certainly good  but was it worth the hype and endless queues  uh not really  this is one greasy burger  note  the proprietors also operate meat market in covent garden   same exact burgers minus the slaughter house vibe and less of a queue

But that day they had a ""Burger Special"" invented by the founder of Bone Daddies (which is one of my favourite places in the world) - so there. I had a Japanes-y style burger.Wow.Just. Wow.Burger foodgasm right there.So why only a 4 star?Well - the venue place with it's notoriety and quick turnover of guests - but you always have to queue. Even on a Monday evening, we had to wait 20min to be seated - which gave us the opportunity to try their cocktails (amazing as well, by the way). I get it, but it's a shame. I hate waiting, I'm really impatient.And although the burger was an incredible taste experience - the sides didn't deliver the same kind of satisfaction. The fries were undercooked, and the onion rings (although huuuuge) were a bit bland.So yeah, MeatLiquor deserves it's reputation of being an iconic burger place in London - that you DEFINITELY need to experience at least once."	having been in london for over a year now  and hearing about everyone s greasy adventures there  i felt like i was missing out on something so yep   finally dragged my bum there a few weeks back and see what all the fuss was about i have to say   i am picky with burgers  since i don t like gherkins nor mustard  but that day they had a  burger special  invented by the founder of bone daddies  which is one of my favourite places in the world    so there  i had a japanes y style burger wow just  wow burger foodgasm right there so why only a 4 star well   the venue place with it s notoriety and quick turnover of guests   but you always have to queue  even on a monday evening  we had to wait 20min to be seated   which gave us the opportunity to try their cocktails  amazing as well  by the way   i get it  but it s a shame  i hate waiting  i m really impatient and although the burger was an incredible taste experience   the sides didn t deliver the same kind of satisfaction  the fries were undercooked  and the onion rings  although huuuuge  were a bit bland so yeah  meatliquor deserves it s reputation of being an iconic burger place in london   that you definitely need to experience at least once 
1949	3.0	Meat? Yes. Liquor? Questionable.I love the irreverent don't-give-a-damn sensibilities of this ostensibly American-themed eatery. You'd think that having lived in London now for over a year, I'd be used to poor service, but even I was impressed by the level of 'I have better things to do than help you.' attitude from our waitress.Fortunately, there was another girl (a manager, perhaps?) yelling at the seemingly lost and confused employees to make themselves useful. Good thing, too... otherwise we might still be there, waiting to put in an order or get our bill.Between the three of us, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Wings, onion rings, fries, fried pickles, a variety of burgers, slaw, and a medley of desserts. Undoubtedly, the food was delightful and reasonably priced.Oh. Let's not forget about the other half of Meat Liquor's appellation. Well, actually... you might as well. Let's get this straight: I'm Chinese. And one that likes the sauce. And I like it enough that friends and significant others buy me books and other paraphernalia on the topic.If I go to any number of proper drinking establishments and order a Sazerac, I'm feeling it after one. I'm typically sloshed by two. And three is right out.Guess how many Sazeracs I had here with no untoward effects... really... try.So, with all that said, come for the meats if you arrive in time to join the queue before it extends past the front doors. Pass on the booze, unless you like yours mostly virgin. And skip Meat(!) Liquor(?) altogether if the wait's likely to be more than 15-20 minutes. Because, really... we're fortunate enough to live in a city where other better options abound.	meat  yes  liquor  questionable i love the irreverent don t give a damn sensibilities of this ostensibly american themed eatery  you d think that having lived in london now for over a year  i d be used to poor service  but even i was impressed by the level of  i have better things to do than help you   attitude from our waitress fortunately  there was another girl  a manager  perhaps   yelling at the seemingly lost and confused employees to make themselves useful  good thing  too    otherwise we might still be there  waiting to put in an order or get our bill between the three of us  we pretty much ordered everything on the menu  wings  onion rings  fries  fried pickles  a variety of burgers  slaw  and a medley of desserts  undoubtedly  the food was delightful and reasonably priced oh  let s not forget about the other half of meat liquor s appellation  well  actually    you might as well  let s get this straight  i m chinese  and one that likes the sauce  and i like it enough that friends and significant others buy me books and other paraphernalia on the topic if i go to any number of proper drinking establishments and order a sazerac  i m feeling it after one  i m typically sloshed by two  and three is right out guess how many sazeracs i had here with no untoward effects    really    try so  with all that said  come for the meats if you arrive in time to join the queue before it extends past the front doors  pass on the booze  unless you like yours mostly virgin  and skip meat    liquor    altogether if the wait s likely to be more than 15 20 minutes  because  really    we re fortunate enough to live in a city where other better options abound 
1950	4.0	"After starting what was not forseen to become such a huge thread, ""in search of the best hamburger in London,"" my friends and I decided to try the Meat Liquor for a couple of reasons, but mainly it was mid-way between everyone's homes and offices.On a Friday night at 8:30 we found ourselves in line with many others queing to get a taste of this famous burger.  We quickly realised we needed some help to pass the time, so one of us went to go get a few beers.  Note: bring beers from home, or buy them beforehand, the nearest place is not close!An hour on the dot passed by and we were seated.  First impression: blasting fun rock music, not a seat empty, damn! there's a bar, awesome artwork all over the place, and so ready to eat!They have a good selection of drinks, and the servers are very attentive to your needs, and when you're ready to order, order more, etc.  There is a note on the back of the menu that says you will need to wait 20 minutes from the time you order to get your burger to allow for cooking and preparations.  This burger was great and juicy and i think had the right ratio of meat to bread.  I think many would debate whether or not the hour line is worth it, but if you're not in a hurry, and just want to enjoy the evening I would definitely go to the Meat Liquor.  During dinner my friends and I found ourselves dancing in our chairs while eating and drinking.  We had a great time!At the end of the night the bill came to £20/person.  The three of us had ordered 3 beers, a cheeseburger, a hippie burger, a philly cheese steak, order of onion rings (definitely recommend these!), order of french fries (nothing special), 2 pamplomas, 1 coke, and a pecan pie.  Definitely a place to try :)"	after starting what was not forseen to become such a huge thread   in search of the best hamburger in london   my friends and i decided to try the meat liquor for a couple of reasons  but mainly it was mid way between everyone s homes and offices on a friday night at 8 30 we found ourselves in line with many others queing to get a taste of this famous burger   we quickly realised we needed some help to pass the time  so one of us went to go get a few beers   note  bring beers from home  or buy them beforehand  the nearest place is not close an hour on the dot passed by and we were seated   first impression  blasting fun rock music  not a seat empty  damn  there s a bar  awesome artwork all over the place  and so ready to eat they have a good selection of drinks  and the servers are very attentive to your needs  and when you re ready to order  order more  etc   there is a note on the back of the menu that says you will need to wait 20 minutes from the time you order to get your burger to allow for cooking and preparations   this burger was great and juicy and i think had the right ratio of meat to bread   i think many would debate whether or not the hour line is worth it  but if you re not in a hurry  and just want to enjoy the evening i would definitely go to the meat liquor   during dinner my friends and i found ourselves dancing in our chairs while eating and drinking   we had a great time at the end of the night the bill came to  20 person   the three of us had ordered 3 beers  a cheeseburger  a hippie burger  a philly cheese steak  order of onion rings  definitely recommend these    order of french fries  nothing special   2 pamplomas  1 coke  and a pecan pie   definitely a place to try   
1951	1.0	Really hated this. Far far too loud, and far too dark. All in all,its a really oppressive and deeply uncomfortable environment in there. I have no idea how they're going to maintain a business after the novelty value wears off. Who on earth this can appeal to, when people are trying to eat under these conditions, I don't know.	really hated this  far far too loud  and far too dark  all in all its a really oppressive and deeply uncomfortable environment in there  i have no idea how they re going to maintain a business after the novelty value wears off  who on earth this can appeal to  when people are trying to eat under these conditions  i don t know 
1952	4.0	Anyone on the foodie scene in London will have heard of #Meateasy. For those of you who haven't this is a meat wagon of joy that serves up possibly the best burgers in London. Unfortunately, that wagon of meat was stolen and Yianni Papoutsis, the creator of these meaty morsels had to go guerilla. Setting up a pop up in a pub in New Cross to serve his meat, Yanni was a hit. When it closed, meat lovers shed a tear... that is until MEAT Liquor opened.I've got to really want it to wait 45 minutes, and I really wanted some of Yanni's meat, I also wanted his buns and booze. So in the cold last night I waited. Unfortunately, I also waited once I was sat down, waited after I ordered and waited to pay. The service here is a shit-show. I watched as one waitress walked back and forth 6 times with the same wet cloth in her hand not actually speaking to customers trying to get her attention, and ignoring the orders waiting to be delivered at the bar. Damn awful.But, I didn't come here to talk about the service (lack of), I came here to get my lips around a mighty chunk of meat, and that I did. My dining partner is not like me. He never exaggerates for affect or humour so when he says that this is the best burger he's ever eaten in his meat eating life, do not knock it. A little pink in the middle, the pattie burger actually melts in your mouth. They also have an outstanding selection of sides and starters. The buffalo wings were lovely and vinegary with a slight kick and the blue cheese sauce with actual blue cheese in it was perfectly pongy. As for the onion rings, that sexy batter that was light and fluffy, cooked just so that the onion doesn't actually get greasy beneath it's batter coat.The bar is also impressive. Sazerac and St Thomas are on the menu and they even managed to cobble together an Aviation when I asked. They have a library of hot sauces and I even found one that was just to hot for me - this rarely happens.So booze, tick, meat, tick, everything else, try again. Uncomfortable seating, really loud music and service that makes you want to scream. Was it worth it? Totally! I hate myself a little bit right now.	anyone on the foodie scene in london will have heard of  meateasy  for those of you who haven t this is a meat wagon of joy that serves up possibly the best burgers in london  unfortunately  that wagon of meat was stolen and yianni papoutsis  the creator of these meaty morsels had to go guerilla  setting up a pop up in a pub in new cross to serve his meat  yanni was a hit  when it closed  meat lovers shed a tear    that is until meat liquor opened i ve got to really want it to wait 45 minutes  and i really wanted some of yanni s meat  i also wanted his buns and booze  so in the cold last night i waited  unfortunately  i also waited once i was sat down  waited after i ordered and waited to pay  the service here is a shit show  i watched as one waitress walked back and forth 6 times with the same wet cloth in her hand not actually speaking to customers trying to get her attention  and ignoring the orders waiting to be delivered at the bar  damn awful but  i didn t come here to talk about the service  lack of   i came here to get my lips around a mighty chunk of meat  and that i did  my dining partner is not like me  he never exaggerates for affect or humour so when he says that this is the best burger he s ever eaten in his meat eating life  do not knock it  a little pink in the middle  the pattie burger actually melts in your mouth  they also have an outstanding selection of sides and starters  the buffalo wings were lovely and vinegary with a slight kick and the blue cheese sauce with actual blue cheese in it was perfectly pongy  as for the onion rings  that sexy batter that was light and fluffy  cooked just so that the onion doesn t actually get greasy beneath it s batter coat the bar is also impressive  sazerac and st thomas are on the menu and they even managed to cobble together an aviation when i asked  they have a library of hot sauces and i even found one that was just to hot for me   this rarely happens so booze  tick  meat  tick  everything else  try again  uncomfortable seating  really loud music and service that makes you want to scream  was it worth it  totally  i hate myself a little bit right now 
1953	4.0	Second visit to Meatliquor and decided to have food at the original outlet. We went during the five year anniversary where everything was 50% off (absolutely mad, and our wallets felt all the better for it). I ordered a Dead Hippie Burger (my favourite) and we decided to share a garbage plate. It's not a plate of garbage - it's a huge plate of chips, caramelized onions, a patty, and barbecue sauce. And it was GOOD. The patties in both burger and plate were dripping with juice as usual, and my friend wanted to go back to MEATliquor again just for the garbage plate (she hates burger buns and loves chips). They played some great music as well, and while some may feel uncomfortable in the darkness, I loved it to bits and am ready to eat more meat. Very friendly waiter as well who was nice and pretty prompt.	second visit to meatliquor and decided to have food at the original outlet  we went during the five year anniversary where everything was 50  off  absolutely mad  and our wallets felt all the better for it   i ordered a dead hippie burger  my favourite  and we decided to share a garbage plate  it s not a plate of garbage   it s a huge plate of chips  caramelized onions  a patty  and barbecue sauce  and it was good  the patties in both burger and plate were dripping with juice as usual  and my friend wanted to go back to meatliquor again just for the garbage plate  she hates burger buns and loves chips   they played some great music as well  and while some may feel uncomfortable in the darkness  i loved it to bits and am ready to eat more meat  very friendly waiter as well who was nice and pretty prompt 
1954	3.0	We waited about 30 minutes to get in the doors and rather than be seated we were told to go and wait at the bar for our name to be called. This was annoying as you have no idea how much longer you've got to wait. We got a drink at the bar and after about 10 minutes we were seated on the main circular table in the middle of the entrance section (shown in the bottom image below).The service was good but it's not a great place to meet and have a chat, the music was loud and the shape of our table meant it was pretty hard to have a conversation without shouting at each other. There are also quite a few bar style seats, which if you're a group means you'll end up sitting in a row rather than across from each other. I'm sure you could wait for a more suitable table, but when you've already queued twice the thought of doing it for a third time isn't exactly appealing.I went for the Dead Hippie, which is made of 2 beef patties, dead hippie sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and minced white onion, which nothing special. Following a great American tradition, there's an eating challenge - 'The Triple Chilli Challenge' consisting of a Chilli Dog, a Green Chilli Cheeseburger and a portion of Chilli Cheese Fries with a 10 minute time limit. Jack has tried and failed but the current record stands at 2mins 47s... Pretty impressive.	we waited about 30 minutes to get in the doors and rather than be seated we were told to go and wait at the bar for our name to be called  this was annoying as you have no idea how much longer you ve got to wait  we got a drink at the bar and after about 10 minutes we were seated on the main circular table in the middle of the entrance section  shown in the bottom image below  the service was good but it s not a great place to meet and have a chat  the music was loud and the shape of our table meant it was pretty hard to have a conversation without shouting at each other  there are also quite a few bar style seats  which if you re a group means you ll end up sitting in a row rather than across from each other  i m sure you could wait for a more suitable table  but when you ve already queued twice the thought of doing it for a third time isn t exactly appealing i went for the dead hippie  which is made of 2 beef patties  dead hippie sauce  lettuce  cheese  pickles and minced white onion  which nothing special  following a great american tradition  there s an eating challenge    the triple chilli challenge  consisting of a chilli dog  a green chilli cheeseburger and a portion of chilli cheese fries with a 10 minute time limit  jack has tried and failed but the current record stands at 2mins 47s    pretty impressive

Goddamn, if I were wearing pants I would need to unzip them and lie on the floor. Again, like a one-night stand... Between the deep fried pickles, onion rings, cheeseburger and chocolate cream pie, I think I ate about 5,000 calories easy. I didn't have a fat ass before tonight, but baby, I do now.*I love eating with Yelpers, they know how to get shit done. And this means ordering almost all the menu. 'We'll have all the starters, and all the sides. You know what, just bring everything.'The food here is to die for. Or to die from. I'm not really sure there's a difference at Meat Liquor.

1957	5.0	My husband and I were in the mood for burgers and MEATliquor didn't have too long of a wait.  We had to wait outside for two minutes and then at the bar for 30 minutes.Food: We started off with the bingo wings which were just what the doctor ordered.  I have been craving good old fashioned wings which they nailed.  For our mains, we ordered the regular cheeseburger and the dirty chicken burger which was fried and delicious.  This was my second time at MEATliquor and this time was better than the first.  I have to admit that I liked the regular cheeseburger better than the burger I got the first time.  For sides got the cheese fries which were ok, regular fries which were classic and delicious and the slaw which was yummy.Drinks: We ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail at the bar while we were waiting.Price: 38.40 GBP for two people.  This does not include our drinks at the bar beforehand.Ambiance: For a Tuesday night at 9.00 PM it was pumping.  Be prepared if its your first time because it feels like a a dark loud dive bar inside.  The vibe/music is fun, but I would definitely think twice before bringing your mom and dad to it.Service: Our server was great.  She was very nice, attentive and friendly.Would I go back?  Definitely, but you have to be in the mood for burgers in a dark rock and roll club atmosphere.	my husband and i were in the mood for burgers and meatliquor didn t have too long of a wait   we had to wait outside for two minutes and then at the bar for 30 minutes food  we started off with the bingo wings which were just what the doctor ordered   i have been craving good old fashioned wings which they nailed   for our mains  we ordered the regular cheeseburger and the dirty chicken burger which was fried and delicious   this was my second time at meatliquor and this time was better than the first   i have to admit that i liked the regular cheeseburger better than the burger i got the first time   for sides got the cheese fries which were ok  regular fries which were classic and delicious and the slaw which was yummy drinks  we ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail at the bar while we were waiting price  38 40 gbp for two people   this does not include our drinks at the bar beforehand ambiance  for a tuesday night at 9 00 pm it was pumping   be prepared if its your first time because it feels like a a dark loud dive bar inside   the vibe music is fun  but i would definitely think twice before bringing your mom and dad to it service  our server was great   she was very nice  attentive and friendly would i go back   definitely  but you have to be in the mood for burgers in a dark rock and roll club atmosphere

1959	3.0	Meat Liquor is loud- loud in decor, loud in food flavour. The restaurant itself sort of hits you in the face with it's blood red decor and darkness. A bear and a wolf among other animals bare their teeth at you from a ceiling scrawled over with red words. Skulls adorn the walls and the place is pretty dark with very very loud music, so you can't really hear yourself. I like meat though and i'm happy to eat it in the dark so I ordered the Dead Hippie burger and my husband got the Mushroom Swiss. We ended up switching burgers, but we were both happy with the switch. I think the Dead Hippie was overflowing with sauce and toppings and I prefer my burgers simpler. It wasn't the best I've had in London, but it was a good solid burger. I might get takeaway though next time as I'd rather eat it somewhere that is not trying so hard to be rock'n'roll, but I know a few people who would love to rock out here and this will be a fun place to take them.	meat liquor is loud  loud in decor  loud in food flavour  the restaurant itself sort of hits you in the face with it s blood red decor and darkness  a bear and a wolf among other animals bare their teeth at you from a ceiling scrawled over with red words  skulls adorn the walls and the place is pretty dark with very very loud music  so you can t really hear yourself  i like meat though and i m happy to eat it in the dark so i ordered the dead hippie burger and my husband got the mushroom swiss  we ended up switching burgers  but we were both happy with the switch  i think the dead hippie was overflowing with sauce and toppings and i prefer my burgers simpler  it wasn t the best i ve had in london  but it was a good solid burger  i might get takeaway though next time as i d rather eat it somewhere that is not trying so hard to be rock n roll  but i know a few people who would love to rock out here and this will be a fun place to take them 
1960	2.0	The most expensive place we ate at during our stay in London.Their beer selection is slim to none and only served in cans. Overpriced cans.We got four CANS of beer, 2 hamburgers, and 2 fries and the total was $75USD.Super silly pricing. The only reason I'm giving this places TWO stars is because the burgers weren't bad.Definitely not deserving of the price I paid, but they were good none the less.I would most likely not recommend this place, only because it was just so ridiculously expensive for the little amount you got.I didn't even leave with a BUZZ.

1961	2.0	"Two stars. One for the bartending and one for being near a Tube station. Let's start with the queuing process because it's a multi-step process.1. Get in the queue which wraps around the building outside. Note all the signage about queue jumping and how they have implemented a hand stamp policy but don't explain how to get a hand stamp. The queue outside of the building is the shortest of the queues you will stand in, so don't get too excited when you actually step foot inside the front door.2. Once at the front of the outside queue, the doorman will invite you into the entryway of the restaurant. You'll stand between the two sets of doors for anywhere from 5-10 minutes.3. At some point, the doorman will invite you into the restaurant where (s)he will direct you to a set of chairs next to the front door where you will sit and wait. Be thankful you get to sit down because you've probably already been waiting 20 minutes and you aren't even close to getting a table yet. Rest and maybe take a little cat nap. If you don't feel like napping, I recommend passing the time by allowing yourself to get adjusted the VERY LOUD music and VERY DIM lighting.4. After a short, noisy wait sitting on the chairs, the doorman will direct you to the bar where you will join the other 30 customers waiting for a table. Getting to the bar will be a challenge because people will stand next to the bar and not move. Getting drinks was actually the best part of our experience. The bartenders do a really good job of visually queuing people and handing out menus when it is their turn. We were able to consume one full cocktail and were about to order a second when the hostess came through the bar area screaming our name. Have I mentioned how loud the music is in this restaurant? It's way, way, way too loud. Once you link up with the hostess who has yelled your name, you will be brought to your table. I hope for your sake, you are not brought to the table we were seated at because it is the Bermuda Triangle of tables in the restaurant. We waited 40 minutes for a server to come and take our order. During this time, I saw two other tables be seated, eat, and leave. After we ordered, we again waited. It's safe to say that Meat Liquor has the worst service of any restaurant I have been to in London. In fact, when we were in part 3 of the queue, I made a comment to my husband about how it didn't look like there was table service because we never saw a server during our time waiting on the chairs.By the time we ordered, it had been 1 hour and 20 minutes from the time we got in the queue outside. Our food arrived an hour later. Again, I watched multiple tables be seated, eat, and leave while we were waiting or our food to arrive.Now the food. It's not great. It's not even really that good.Fried pickles - Americans, do not get your hopes up. These are not the fried pickles you get in the States. These are slices of pickles (not spears and not chips) which are then fried in ""fish n' chip"" batter. They are tasteless. Actually, they do taste like something: fried. The batter is wrong. The style of pickle is wrong. There is no seasoning and they are served with blue cheese instead of ranch (and our server told us they do not have ranch even though it clearly states on the menu that their fried chicken salad has ranch dressing). If you have had the delight of having a great basket of fried pickles in the states, do yourself a favor and don't order them at Meat Liquor.Coleslaw - the best part of the meal. Order it.Cheeseburger - greasy with a small bun and no flavor. A huge disappointment.Fries - skinny fries which were served ice cold and without any salt. Had we been able to find a server, we would have sent them back.Fried chicken sandwich - my husband has not left the toilet since eating his sandwich yesterday, if that tells you anything.Meat Liquor is all about the hype and, in my opinion, there is no reason to eat here. The queuing process is ridiculous. The food is average at best. It's super loud and dark in the restaurant (you will not be able to carry on a conversation with your friend seated next to you). And the service is horrible."	two stars  one for the bartending and one for being near a tube station  let s start with the queuing process because it s a multi step process 1  get in the queue which wraps around the building outside  note all the signage about queue jumping and how they have implemented a hand stamp policy but don t explain how to get a hand stamp  the queue outside of the building is the shortest of the queues you will stand in  so don t get too excited when you actually step foot inside the front door 2  once at the front of the outside queue  the doorman will invite you into the entryway of the restaurant  you ll stand between the two sets of doors for anywhere from 5 10 minutes 3  at some point  the doorman will invite you into the restaurant where  s he will direct you to a set of chairs next to the front door where you will sit and wait  be thankful you get to sit down because you ve probably already been waiting 20 minutes and you aren t even close to getting a table yet  rest and maybe take a little cat nap  if you don t feel like napping  i recommend passing the time by allowing yourself to get adjusted the very loud music and very dim lighting 4  after a short  noisy wait sitting on the chairs  the doorman will direct you to the bar where you will join the other 30 customers waiting for a table  getting to the bar will be a challenge because people will stand next to the bar and not move  getting drinks was actually the best part of our experience  the bartenders do a really good job of visually queuing people and handing out menus when it is their turn  we were able to consume one full cocktail and were about to order a second when the hostess came through the bar area screaming our name  have i mentioned how loud the music is in this restaurant  it s way  way  way too loud  once you link up with the hostess who has yelled your name  you will be brought to your table  i hope for your sake  you are not brought to the table we were seated at because it is the bermuda triangle of tables in the restaurant  we waited 40 minutes for a server to come and take our order  during this time  i saw two other tables be seated  eat  and leave  after we ordered  we again waited  it s safe to say that meat liquor has the worst service of any restaurant i have been to in london  in fact  when we were in part 3 of the queue  i made a comment to my husband about how it didn t look like there was table service because we never saw a server during our time waiting on the chairs by the time we ordered  it had been 1 hour and 20 minutes from the time we got in the queue outside  our food arrived an hour later  again  i watched multiple tables be seated  eat  and leave while we were waiting or our food to arrive now the food  it s not great  it s not even really that good fried pickles   americans  do not get your hopes up  these are not the fried pickles you get in the states  these are slices of pickles  not spears and not chips  which are then fried in  fish n  chip  batter  they are tasteless  actually  they do taste like something  fried  the batter is wrong  the style of pickle is wrong  there is no seasoning and they are served with blue cheese instead of ranch  and our server told us they do not have ranch even though it clearly states on the menu that their fried chicken salad has ranch dressing   if you have had the delight of having a great basket of fried pickles in the states  do yourself a favor and don t order them at meat liquor coleslaw   the best part of the meal  order it cheeseburger   greasy with a small bun and no flavor  a huge disappointment fries   skinny fries which were served ice cold and without any salt  had we been able to find a server  we would have sent them back fried chicken sandwich   my husband has not left the toilet since eating his sandwich yesterday  if that tells you anything meat liquor is all about the hype and  in my opinion  there is no reason to eat here  the queuing process is ridiculous  the food is average at best  it s super loud and dark in the restaurant  you will not be able to carry on a conversation with your friend seated next to you   and the service is horrible 
1962	4.0	"Oh, where do I begin? I'll cut to the chase, Buffalo Chicken Burger... extra Buffalo Sauce and Blue Cheese on the side please... that dish alone is worth five stars to me, and for some reason consistently better here then at their sister restaurant, Meat Mission.Where they lose a star, and I hate to say this, is that it just seems too cool for school here... I've had every form of customer service, ranging from bad to good, but where the Buffalo Chicken Burger wins hereconsistently Meat Mission has consistently better customer service, perhaps helped by it not being as loud or dark there as it is in Meat Liquor.Another reason for a lost star that both places share is something I find quite odd... I like chilli cheese fries, but prefer the chilli on the side so that I can add it as I see fit... so sue me! This type of request is notnormally an issue at most places, but at both establishments I've been told that I can either have them with or without chilli, but not with the chilli on the side... so I essentially have to pay for chilli that I don't get... this urks me personally as I can't imagine how this would put them out,dollop it on the side instead of on the top... it's not exactly the most advanced form of science.But again, that dang Buffalo Chicken Burger... the best I've had this side of the pond while rivalling some of the best I've had stateside. The other dishes I've had here have been good, but I stick with the BCB and Chilli Cheese Fries sans Chilli (I love the mustard versus jalepeno taste theyhave even if I'm robbed of the chilli) consistently simply because my heartsings like Celine Deon and Mariah Carey's love child in their presence.They also have fried pickles, but more often than not they don't have much of a pickle kick so I shy away from them now... to be fair I see this at a lot of places though, both here and in the US. (Side note: this is why ILOVE the Panko Fried Olives at The Huxley in Edinburgh... they consistently retain their ""bite""... I can't believe I haven't seen more of these little treasures.)The prices aren't that bad on food here to be honest, but as with many places they'll sting you on the cocktails... while creative, I've worked my way through enough of them to know they weren't my thing at this particular establishment so I stick to the beers personally.The place itself is a bit dungeon like, very dark and loud... it's a cool vibe, no doubt, but it can be a bit much if you're just hungry. The flipside of that is that if you're a tourist in the are reading this, craving some greasy food at a reasonable price for the area, it may be worth a visit just because it's so random compared to the outside of thebuilding and area.Be warned though, despite being off of the main road queues still form at busy times and there's no saving seats... they won't seat you until your whole party is there - they even have a bouncer, complete with stamping apparatus, to keep the order.While some of the above seems to focus on the negative aspects please be assured that I will return here, no doubt many times... I assume that speaks for itself.Speaking of, now I'm craving that dang Buffalo Chicken Burger something terrible. ;-)"	oh  where do i begin  i ll cut to the chase  buffalo chicken burger    extra buffalo sauce and blue cheese on the side please    that dish alone is worth five stars to me  and for some reason consistently better here then at their sister restaurant  meat mission where they lose a star  and i hate to say this  is that it just seems too cool for school here    i ve had every form of customer service  ranging from bad to good  but where the buffalo chicken burger wins hereconsistently meat mission has consistently better customer service  perhaps helped by it not being as loud or dark there as it is in meat liquor another reason for a lost star that both places share is something i find quite odd    i like chilli cheese fries  but prefer the chilli on the side so that i can add it as i see fit    so sue me  this type of request is notnormally an issue at most places  but at both establishments i ve been told that i can either have them with or without chilli  but not with the chilli on the side    so i essentially have to pay for chilli that i don t get    this urks me personally as i can t imagine how this would put them out dollop it on the side instead of on the top    it s not exactly the most advanced form of science but again  that dang buffalo chicken burger    the best i ve had this side of the pond while rivalling some of the best i ve had stateside  the other dishes i ve had here have been good  but i stick with the bcb and chilli cheese fries sans chilli  i love the mustard versus jalepeno taste theyhave even if i m robbed of the chilli  consistently simply because my heartsings like celine deon and mariah carey s love child in their presence they also have fried pickles  but more often than not they don t have much of a pickle kick so i shy away from them now    to be fair i see this at a lot of places though  both here and in the us   side note  this is why ilove the panko fried olives at the huxley in edinburgh    they consistently retain their  bite     i can t believe i haven t seen more of these little treasures  the prices aren t that bad on food here to be honest  but as with many places they ll sting you on the cocktails    while creative  i ve worked my way through enough of them to know they weren t my thing at this particular establishment so i stick to the beers personally the place itself is a bit dungeon like  very dark and loud    it s a cool vibe  no doubt  but it can be a bit much if you re just hungry  the flipside of that is that if you re a tourist in the are reading this  craving some greasy food at a reasonable price for the area  it may be worth a visit just because it s so random compared to the outside of thebuilding and area be warned though  despite being off of the main road queues still form at busy times and there s no saving seats    they won t seat you until your whole party is there   they even have a bouncer  complete with stamping apparatus  to keep the order while some of the above seems to focus on the negative aspects please be assured that i will return here  no doubt many times    i assume that speaks for itself speaking of  now i m craving that dang buffalo chicken burger something terrible     
1963	4.0	"Growing up in North American cities, I have fond memories of massive, greasy, juicy burgers with thin-cut fries. Meat Liquor definitely lives up to the ""American-style"" that they seek to emulate.I was feeling homesick, so my friend and I decided to brave the weather and try the fabled burgers. We arrived at 630pm on a weekday only to find a MASSIVE queue that was at least 50 people long. Not to mention it started snowing and we were both half-frozen...but there was no turning back. We were seated promptly once the table was ready, and ordered burgers, fries and cider. Service can be a bit hit/miss. For the record, the cider tasted strange - lesson learnt: never order cider from France. The cheeseburgers were just what I imagined, and needed. They weren't huge, but very filling...not to mention greasy and a bit of a mess to eat! The patty was pink in the centre (just how I like it) - two thumbs up for that. Fries were average, nothing to rave about. We decided to try dessert because pecan pie caught our eyes with bourbon ice cream. Demolished in less than 5 minutes. I must say though that I haven't been back largely because of the wait times, and the number of amazing burgers to try across town. But if I'm ever looking for a reminder of home, I know Meat Liquor will do the job."	growing up in north american cities  i have fond memories of massive  greasy  juicy burgers with thin cut fries  meat liquor definitely lives up to the  american style  that they seek to emulate i was feeling homesick  so my friend and i decided to brave the weather and try the fabled burgers  we arrived at 630pm on a weekday only to find a massive queue that was at least 50 people long  not to mention it started snowing and we were both half frozen   but there was no turning back  we were seated promptly once the table was ready  and ordered burgers  fries and cider  service can be a bit hit miss  for the record  the cider tasted strange   lesson learnt  never order cider from france  the cheeseburgers were just what i imagined  and needed  they weren t huge  but very filling   not to mention greasy and a bit of a mess to eat  the patty was pink in the centre  just how i like it    two thumbs up for that  fries were average  nothing to rave about  we decided to try dessert because pecan pie caught our eyes with bourbon ice cream  demolished in less than 5 minutes  i must say though that i haven t been back largely because of the wait times  and the number of amazing burgers to try across town  but if i m ever looking for a reminder of home  i know meat liquor will do the job 
1964	4.0	"So after a busy Saturday crawling round East London markets we had worked up an appetite and were in the need of some food... fast. I've wanted to go here for a while and as a London newbie it was one of the places near my work (Oxford Street) that I was recommended (As well as Bodeans + Honest Burger).It was about 4:30pm my girlfriend and I entered to be greeted by a happy go lucky kinda guy who said that it was 40-minute wait. I was a little bit hesitant but we headed to the bar.  I had a can of Budweiser (£3.90 - 330ml) and the Mrs. had a sweet cheeks cider (£4.50 - bottle), which her being the queen of ciders gave her royal approval. We patiently waited at the bar and the first thing we saw was big trays of burgers, chicken wings and chips and other amazing looking food being hauled about by the staff. We knew then we had made the right choice to wait! 20 mins went by squeezing/sneaking into other patron's gaps to upgrade our standing space as there names were called. We had to dodge old people spilling there drinks as they could not see what they were doing because it was so dark in there. We sniggered at the table guy shouting ""Adrian"" like the scene from Rocky and we immediately wished we had chosen a more funny name like Toby Lerone so we could hear it projected across the bar. Then our name was called.We were shown to a table right next to the bar were we had been standing and it was a 6 seater bench with 4 spaces. We chose to sit on the end opposite each other and a couple of minutes later 2 other guys were seated in the middle of us. It was not the best of seats and I could see much better seating around the edge of the main room. But hey I was here for the MEAT.Annoyingly the waitress came and the 2 guys that turned up after us managed to butt in first. We ordered straight after. Thanks to the yelp photo's I already knew what I wanted! We ordered 1x Dead hippie burger(£7.50), 1x Chilli Burger (£7), 1x Bingo Wings (Chicken Wings)(£6) and 1x Chilli Cheese Fries (£5) for the 2 of us. (Yes we were hungry).  Total cost for food (£25.50) they add a £1 donation on for the homeless, which at this time of the year I'm more than happy to pay. Service is optional.The food tasted delicious for me the chicken wings were the highlight I'd say they are the best I've ever had. The burgers were good and not having been to tommi's or honest burger yet I only have GBK and Handmade Burger company to compare to, Meat Liquor beats both of them for like for like.  After we left someone said ""OMG did you have the pickles?"" Omg we did not I'm afraid so will be having them if I ever go back. (too many other places to go at the minute)The seating was this places only let down but that's just luck of the draw I guess. It was a bit annoying sat by the bar to eat as you still had the Rocky guy shouting names in your ear as you ate and people brushing past you like a pack of lions running to feed on wildebeest. (yes they did make a good job of the place looking like slaughter house)."	so after a busy saturday crawling round east london markets we had worked up an appetite and were in the need of some food    fast  i ve wanted to go here for a while and as a london newbie it was one of the places near my work  oxford street  that i was recommended  as well as bodeans   honest burger  it was about 4 30pm my girlfriend and i entered to be greeted by a happy go lucky kinda guy who said that it was 40 minute wait  i was a little bit hesitant but we headed to the bar   i had a can of budweiser   3 90   330ml  and the mrs  had a sweet cheeks cider   4 50   bottle   which her being the queen of ciders gave her royal approval  we patiently waited at the bar and the first thing we saw was big trays of burgers  chicken wings and chips and other amazing looking food being hauled about by the staff  we knew then we had made the right choice to wait  20 mins went by squeezing sneaking into other patron s gaps to upgrade our standing space as there names were called  we had to dodge old people spilling there drinks as they could not see what they were doing because it was so dark in there  we sniggered at the table guy shouting  adrian  like the scene from rocky and we immediately wished we had chosen a more funny name like toby lerone so we could hear it projected across the bar  then our name was called we were shown to a table right next to the bar were we had been standing and it was a 6 seater bench with 4 spaces  we chose to sit on the end opposite each other and a couple of minutes later 2 other guys were seated in the middle of us  it was not the best of seats and i could see much better seating around the edge of the main room  but hey i was here for the meat annoyingly the waitress came and the 2 guys that turned up after us managed to butt in first  we ordered straight after  thanks to the yelp photo s i already knew what i wanted  we ordered 1x dead hippie burger  7 50   1x chilli burger   7   1x bingo wings  chicken wings   6  and 1x chilli cheese fries   5  for the 2 of us   yes we were hungry    total cost for food   25 50  they add a  1 donation on for the homeless  which at this time of the year i m more than happy to pay  service is optional the food tasted delicious for me the chicken wings were the highlight i d say they are the best i ve ever had  the burgers were good and not having been to tommi s or honest burger yet i only have gbk and handmade burger company to compare to  meat liquor beats both of them for like for like   after we left someone said  omg did you have the pickles   omg we did not i m afraid so will be having them if i ever go back   too many other places to go at the minute the seating was this places only let down but that s just luck of the draw i guess  it was a bit annoying sat by the bar to eat as you still had the rocky guy shouting names in your ear as you ate and people brushing past you like a pack of lions running to feed on wildebeest   yes they did make a good job of the place looking like slaughter house

Did someone say queues? not anymore, with punters getting their burger kicks from else where in the city MEATliquor wasn't so busy, which meant we got a table with ease, don't get me wrong, it was still busy, but a comfortable busy. Now if you have read my other reviews you will know I'm a fan of the MEAT empire, I ordered my fav MEAT burger the 'Dead Hippie', it's my ultimate feel good burger, greasy, meaty and that special sauce,  get's me every time.  The sides were spot on as usual, deep fried pickles being my favorite.Service was quick and efficient, as to be expected.So after a couple of years of being talk of the town, MEATliquor still holds it's own in London's burger boom.  Still worth a visit.	it s taken me two bloody years to get my arse here  two bloody years  been to meatmarket   meatmission but never meatliquor  that is until now  did someone say queues  not anymore  with punters getting their burger kicks from else where in the city meatliquor wasn t so busy  which meant we got a table with ease  don t get me wrong  it was still busy  but a comfortable busy  now if you have read my other reviews you will know i m a fan of the meat empire  i ordered my fav meat burger the  dead hippie   it s my ultimate feel good burger  greasy  meaty and that special sauce   get s me every time   the sides were spot on as usual  deep fried pickles being my favorite service was quick and efficient  as to be expected so after a couple of years of being talk of the town  meatliquor still holds it s own in london s burger boom   still worth a visit 
1966	4.0	From the outside during the day, I would have never noticed this place. We went early for lunch on a weekend so we avoided the lines thank goodness! The interior decor is interestinga bit dark but the general theme ties together well.We tried a regular cheeseburger, the double patty cheeseburger, and the onion rings. Rich, greasy, and satisfying sums it all up. The food came out on one tray and you just grab some napkins and chow down. I actually would have preferred plates as my burger juices were dripping all over the place but that's a minor thing I can look past.	from the outside during the day  i would have never noticed this place  we went early for lunch on a weekend so we avoided the lines thank goodness  the interior decor is interestinga bit dark but the general theme ties together well we tried a regular cheeseburger  the double patty cheeseburger  and the onion rings  rich  greasy  and satisfying sums it all up  the food came out on one tray and you just grab some napkins and chow down  i actually would have preferred plates as my burger juices were dripping all over the place but that s a minor thing i can look past

1968	3.0	Certainly wouldn't queue for the food. The burgers were good i'll give them that. The chips a disappointment (quite plastic-y) the pickles in batter would have been better if they weren't thin practically non existent slithers. It was like just eating some greasey batter.  The salad was very oniony. Loved the decor and the service was great. They are very on top of what they are doing in the respect.	certainly wouldn t queue for the food  the burgers were good i ll give them that  the chips a disappointment  quite plastic y  the pickles in batter would have been better if they weren t thin practically non existent slithers  it was like just eating some greasey batter   the salad was very oniony  loved the decor and the service was great  they are very on top of what they are doing in the respect

1970	2.0	We came here for a late night bite, after 10pm on a school night.  Most other places were closed, but we heard that the kitchen here was open until 11pm.  Meat Liquor had been one of my bookmarks for a while, but I hadn't visited it until this time.There was only one of the burgers available, as the kitchen was in the process of closing for the night, but I wasn't too worried about that.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the meal.  The bun ended up being a mushy mess and it was a bit gross to eat.  The filling was ok, but not good enough to offset the disappointing bun.The staff were friendly, but I was too disappointed by the food to return.	we came here for a late night bite  after 10pm on a school night   most other places were closed  but we heard that the kitchen here was open until 11pm   meat liquor had been one of my bookmarks for a while  but i hadn t visited it until this time there was only one of the burgers available  as the kitchen was in the process of closing for the night  but i wasn t too worried about that   unfortunately  i was underwhelmed by the meal   the bun ended up being a mushy mess and it was a bit gross to eat   the filling was ok  but not good enough to offset the disappointing bun the staff were friendly  but i was too disappointed by the food to return 
1971	5.0	I have reviews from the USA pending. I don't care. I am an avid Meatwagon fan, I'm just here to gush about how much i love this place. Wherever Yanni goes, I WILL FOLLOW. When I crave a Meatwagon burger I will make the holy pilgrimage to find them!The Buffalo Chicken Burger is the new Dead Hippie. I obsessed about the Dead Hippie after my first taste, now I am equally as obsessed with the Buffalo Chicken Burger. I have had dreams about it. F**K FRIES, the Fried Pickles are the new thing. Served with blue cheese dip. I was never a pickle person, but oh how my opinions on pickles have been changed. The cocktails again like #Meateasy are courtesy of the Soul Shakers.  Want a real cocktails? They are your guys!!! For what I think of their burgers/chilli fries... refer to my #Meateasy review. The negatives to this place? I don't really care. Whatever negatives I find are always outweighed by how much I love the food. That is true love right there!	i have reviews from the usa pending  i don t care  i am an avid meatwagon fan  i m just here to gush about how much i love this place  wherever yanni goes  i will follow  when i crave a meatwagon burger i will make the holy pilgrimage to find them the buffalo chicken burger is the new dead hippie  i obsessed about the dead hippie after my first taste  now i am equally as obsessed with the buffalo chicken burger  i have had dreams about it  f  k fries  the fried pickles are the new thing  served with blue cheese dip  i was never a pickle person  but oh how my opinions on pickles have been changed  the cocktails again like  meateasy are courtesy of the soul shakers   want a real cocktails  they are your guys    for what i think of their burgers chilli fries    refer to my  meateasy review  the negatives to this place  i don t really care  whatever negatives i find are always outweighed by how much i love the food  that is true love right there 
1972	5.0	Came here a couple of weeks ago with some friends.  We'd all been to the pop up place, Meateasy, they had in New Cross so we couldn't resist coming back for some meaty, greasy goodness.  We waited about 20mins outside for a table, not bad, but was made a lot worse by the smell of the food being wafted out everytime the door opened!For those expecting fine dining gourmet burgers, don't come here.  It is purely about the food and the loud music, garish deco and dim lighting wouldn't be for you.  If you're not at all bothered then coming here is a must!When I'd gone to Meateasy, I had the Dead Hippie which is still on the menu here.  This was so so good, and if you're addicted to In 'n Out's Animal Style and don't live in California (like me) then this is very close to it!  This time round though I went for the chilli dog.  Between us all we'd also got some fries, onion rings and tried out the fried pickles.All the food was served up on one big tray, and the kitchen roll on tables rather than napkins was so much more useful!  The food - oh the food was an absolute meat feast.  Every bite was filled with greasy goodness.  I did eat a little too much, and on my way for drinks afterwards I'd discovered one of my coat buttons had popped off :/  Oh well, I don't care, I'll definitely be back!	came here a couple of weeks ago with some friends   we d all been to the pop up place  meateasy  they had in new cross so we couldn t resist coming back for some meaty  greasy goodness   we waited about 20mins outside for a table  not bad  but was made a lot worse by the smell of the food being wafted out everytime the door opened for those expecting fine dining gourmet burgers  don t come here   it is purely about the food and the loud music  garish deco and dim lighting wouldn t be for you   if you re not at all bothered then coming here is a must when i d gone to meateasy  i had the dead hippie which is still on the menu here   this was so so good  and if you re addicted to in  n out s animal style and don t live in california  like me  then this is very close to it   this time round though i went for the chilli dog   between us all we d also got some fries  onion rings and tried out the fried pickles all the food was served up on one big tray  and the kitchen roll on tables rather than napkins was so much more useful   the food   oh the food was an absolute meat feast   every bite was filled with greasy goodness   i did eat a little too much  and on my way for drinks afterwards i d discovered one of my coat buttons had popped off     oh well  i don t care  i ll definitely be back 
1973	4.0	Food is great, usually pretty quick to come out and not that expensive. The burgers are pretty damn good - not your usual boring burgers. Only cons are that the venue is super dark and the food comes out on a tray, no on individual plates.	food is great  usually pretty quick to come out and not that expensive  the burgers are pretty damn good   not your usual boring burgers  only cons are that the venue is super dark and the food comes out on a tray  no on individual plates 
1974	4.0	I can't help but fall in love with the raw, gritty feel of Meat Liquor.I've always been a lover of street art, and am rather fond of the barbarous, blood splattered street art adorning both the walls and ceilings of this establishment.This is definitely not one for the vegetarians! Walk through the doors and your hit with a dimly lit interior, with bold black and white murals of half naked, fleshy, human/animal crossbreeds, clumsy scrawled etchings between them, all splattered and sprayed in crimson red. Red strip lights give this a underworld, dark feel.I know I might be giving a bit too much away by my guilty pleasures, but imagine the starting credits to True Blood, I think this pretty much sums the air and what you might expect here. Something a bit hilly billy (think the hills have eyes and Texas chainsaw massacre), a bit grotesque, macabre and a little wrong.I love art like this! But then as you might have guessed, I'm a horror film fan!The burgers really aren't that bad here too! And this is what Meat Liquor is famous for. You can tell where this place is before you get there, you can smell the meaty scent streets away!Although your arteries are going to hate this place, if your after a good fat burger, and deep fried food hit, this is the place for you.I don't think this is the best burger you'll ever get - but it's pretty darn good!Being the larger brother of Meat Market, you'll find a very similar menu here - and both should be awarded for the best name for a burger ever - the interestingly named dead hippie that features a double patty.Wanting something smaller, I opted for the Green Chili Cheeseburger and pickle fries (or gherkins if your English) and I have to say I was pretty impressed with the spiciness of the burger, usually you're get something meek, whilst this had good kick.Cocktails are also worth a go, I went for a 'tipping the velvet', and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Served in a glass tankard, it was well balanced and not too sweet.I loved how each table was provided with kitchen roll, nothing fancy here! One recommendation is to try the large middle table (if you can), this, sat in the middle of the dome at the front of the restaurant is a little off-putting (due to the echo), but allows you to hear what other people are saying because of the acoustics.The reason why I haven't five stared this review is because I have heard that usually there is a big queue, and as we went on a Monday we went straight in, so I'd like to check this out when it's got more of  a bustling atmosphere.	i can t help but fall in love with the raw  gritty feel of meat liquor i ve always been a lover of street art  and am rather fond of the barbarous  blood splattered street art adorning both the walls and ceilings of this establishment this is definitely not one for the vegetarians  walk through the doors and your hit with a dimly lit interior  with bold black and white murals of half naked  fleshy  human animal crossbreeds  clumsy scrawled etchings between them  all splattered and sprayed in crimson red  red strip lights give this a underworld  dark feel i know i might be giving a bit too much away by my guilty pleasures  but imagine the starting credits to true blood  i think this pretty much sums the air and what you might expect here  something a bit hilly billy  think the hills have eyes and texas chainsaw massacre   a bit grotesque  macabre and a little wrong i love art like this  but then as you might have guessed  i m a horror film fan the burgers really aren t that bad here too  and this is what meat liquor is famous for  you can tell where this place is before you get there  you can smell the meaty scent streets away although your arteries are going to hate this place  if your after a good fat burger  and deep fried food hit  this is the place for you i don t think this is the best burger you ll ever get   but it s pretty darn good being the larger brother of meat market  you ll find a very similar menu here   and both should be awarded for the best name for a burger ever   the interestingly named dead hippie that features a double patty wanting something smaller  i opted for the green chili cheeseburger and pickle fries  or gherkins if your english  and i have to say i was pretty impressed with the spiciness of the burger  usually you re get something meek  whilst this had good kick cocktails are also worth a go  i went for a  tipping the velvet   and i have to say i wasn t disappointed  served in a glass tankard  it was well balanced and not too sweet i loved how each table was provided with kitchen roll  nothing fancy here  one recommendation is to try the large middle table  if you can   this  sat in the middle of the dome at the front of the restaurant is a little off putting  due to the echo   but allows you to hear what other people are saying because of the acoustics the reason why i haven t five stared this review is because i have heard that usually there is a big queue  and as we went on a monday we went straight in  so i d like to check this out when it s got more of  a bustling atmosphere 
1975	3.0	This place used to be my favourite, I'm starting to think it was because I was so stoned... The place is amazing- American southern gothic goes tacky farmhouse-diner. The music is LOUD and they play all of my old school country favourites- Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Hank Williams, June Carter, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc... They have all of the gimmick-stuff like meals on a fast food trey, beers served in cans, photobooth and so on. Doesn't it sound like stoner disneyland?**chili cheese fries, onion rings and dead hippie w/ extra pickles 4 life**Last time I came they played techno so I don't think I'll be risking another meal there, but I'll always remember it fondly.	this place used to be my favourite  i m starting to think it was because i was so stoned    the place is amazing  american southern gothic goes tacky farmhouse diner  the music is loud and they play all of my old school country favourites  johnny cash  patsy cline  hank williams  june carter  george jones  waylon jennings  willie nelson  etc    they have all of the gimmick stuff like meals on a fast food trey  beers served in cans  photobooth and so on  doesn t it sound like stoner disneyland   chili cheese fries  onion rings and dead hippie w  extra pickles 4 life  last time i came they played techno so i don t think i ll be risking another meal there  but i ll always remember it fondly 
1976	2.0	My wife and I tend to go out of our way to try burger joints.  This was my first trip to London and we decided that we'd see what the city had to offer in our favorite food.  We saw that Meat Liquor was fairly close and decided to give it a try.  When we arrived we stood in line outside for about 40 minutes.  No big deal because we struck up a conversation with some fellow Steelers fans and passed the time.  Once we were allowed inside I was a bit taken aback by how dark the lighting and how loud the music was.  I nearly told my wife we were leaving right away but we had waited so long already and were fairly hungry so we pressed on.  We ordered drinks from the bar.  The drinks were good and the bartenders act was fun at first but the production took so long that our table was ready before our drinks.  We got seated at a big round community table with other patrons.  Which would have been great if we could have seen or heard them.  Again if you are looking for a place where you can have any conversation at all look elsewhere.  We both ordered burgers and a side each, fried pickles for her and fries for me.  The fried pickles were decent.  A bit greasy and that kept us from finishing them. The fries were from McDonalds.  I don't know how they get them but they are EXACTLY like McDonalds fries...except they cost £3.  The burgers themselves were good.  Not the best burger by a long shot but we've had worse.  So in summary,  the food was average.  The ambiance was terrible.  I think the staff was good.  You have so little interaction with them and the noise and lighting make the interaction you do have with them impossible to rate.  I really wish this place wasn't trying so hard to be cool.  I don't mind trying to be unique but this isn't the way to do it.  Will we be coming back to London?   Absolutely.  Will we be going back to Meat Liquor when we do?   Absolutely not.	my wife and i tend to go out of our way to try burger joints   this was my first trip to london and we decided that we d see what the city had to offer in our favorite food   we saw that meat liquor was fairly close and decided to give it a try   when we arrived we stood in line outside for about 40 minutes   no big deal because we struck up a conversation with some fellow steelers fans and passed the time   once we were allowed inside i was a bit taken aback by how dark the lighting and how loud the music was   i nearly told my wife we were leaving right away but we had waited so long already and were fairly hungry so we pressed on   we ordered drinks from the bar   the drinks were good and the bartenders act was fun at first but the production took so long that our table was ready before our drinks   we got seated at a big round community table with other patrons   which would have been great if we could have seen or heard them   again if you are looking for a place where you can have any conversation at all look elsewhere   we both ordered burgers and a side each  fried pickles for her and fries for me   the fried pickles were decent   a bit greasy and that kept us from finishing them  the fries were from mcdonalds   i don t know how they get them but they are exactly like mcdonalds fries   except they cost  3   the burgers themselves were good   not the best burger by a long shot but we ve had worse   so in summary   the food was average   the ambiance was terrible   i think the staff was good   you have so little interaction with them and the noise and lighting make the interaction you do have with them impossible to rate   i really wish this place wasn t trying so hard to be cool   i don t mind trying to be unique but this isn t the way to do it   will we be coming back to london    absolutely   will we be going back to meat liquor when we do    absolutely not

1978	5.0	2 of the best words in the English language... Meat. Liquor. However good the meat and liquor is here, the real James Dean is the onion rings.

1980	4.0	A great experience when it opened a few years back, but the food is still one of the top in the thin'n'sloppy burger field. While queueing and waiting inside does annoy some, it definitely builds anticipation and hunger.We shared onion rings (great big, crispy-on-the-outside juicy-on-the-inside ones) and chilli fries, along with a dead hippy each and a few beers. Full-force flavour, in the way only Americans and their imitators can deliver, matched with a price tag that you can (but probably shouldn't) sniff at.If you've not been and think you'll like it, then definitely do so. If what you're looking for is a bandwagon to catch when it's already 7 miles out of town, then I can't really help. You'll be elbow-to-elbow with someone, sucking juices off your fingers and making ample use of the kitchen rolls. Service was acceptable.	a great experience when it opened a few years back  but the food is still one of the top in the thin n sloppy burger field  while queueing and waiting inside does annoy some  it definitely builds anticipation and hunger we shared onion rings  great big  crispy on the outside juicy on the inside ones  and chilli fries  along with a dead hippy each and a few beers  full force flavour  in the way only americans and their imitators can deliver  matched with a price tag that you can  but probably shouldn t  sniff at if you ve not been and think you ll like it  then definitely do so  if what you re looking for is a bandwagon to catch when it s already 7 miles out of town  then i can t really help  you ll be elbow to elbow with someone  sucking juices off your fingers and making ample use of the kitchen rolls  service was acceptable

1983	3.0	American Fatness near you, right off Oxford. How about that?!The interior is dark and loud music mostly rock. Cool graffiti on the walls and roof.I just had the typical cheese burger and fires, the burger was done very well and very juicy and tasty. The fries were a bit of a disappointment. The fries are the kind you can get from MacDonald's thin and powdery inside.But generally as you can see I gave it for stars because of the friendliness of the host and waitress, the burger flavor, and the atmosphere.This place is basically where you can come with a bunch of friends 4 or more and just hang out and munch on all the yummy fried stuff.	american fatness near you  right off oxford  how about that  the interior is dark and loud music mostly rock  cool graffiti on the walls and roof i just had the typical cheese burger and fires  the burger was done very well and very juicy and tasty  the fries were a bit of a disappointment  the fries are the kind you can get from macdonald s thin and powdery inside but generally as you can see i gave it for stars because of the friendliness of the host and waitress  the burger flavor  and the atmosphere this place is basically where you can come with a bunch of friends 4 or more and just hang out and munch on all the yummy fried stuff 
1984	3.0	I Tried to visit this place a couple of times but it was always too busy. Today it was very quiet so I popped in for some food. Not a fan of the interior at all, too dark and noisy and not very comfortable. I ordered the buffalo chicken burger and a side order of fries. The burger was very tasty and not too spicy. It was a decent size but not sure it was worth the money without a side. Overall not overly impressed, not sure what all the hype was about...	i tried to visit this place a couple of times but it was always too busy  today it was very quiet so i popped in for some food  not a fan of the interior at all  too dark and noisy and not very comfortable  i ordered the buffalo chicken burger and a side order of fries  the burger was very tasty and not too spicy  it was a decent size but not sure it was worth the money without a side  overall not overly impressed  not sure what all the hype was about   
1985	3.0	Mwa....Queing, very loud music and over rated burgers.I went here because my colleagues were raving about this place.Looking for the best burger around the world it seemed like I had to try this place.Unfortunately it felt like I was in San Francisco to que outside (even as a single person) and there is not much I dislike more than that. Inside it is very dark and very loud (apparently they have their own 24/7 radio station with random music) and not very clear what you have to do. Some people do have to que at the bar, others are seated and can order there. The please must be great for groups, because you can sit, drink and shout all that you want.There were only 2 beers on the menu, which is very disappointing. They come in cans and a frozen glass. The glass was very nice, keeps the beer nice and chilled.The burger I ordered was the Cheese/Bacon medium rare. When I got the burger, it wasn't really medium rare, rather medium well and it had a very strong smoke taste. The bun was good, patty nice and thick (though a bit on the dry side) and the sauce ok. All and all an average burger which doesn't score very high on my 'best burger of the world list'.As a side I ordered the Chili Fries (with meat). This was a good option, I liked them a lot. Fries were nice and crisp (in the beginning) and the sauce and meat had a very nice flavour. This actually saved the meal, without the fries I would rated the place 2 stars.When I ordered a second beer, they messed up the order and I never received it. When I told the waitress she was great and took the first beer of the bill :)Would I go back: don't think soWould I recommend: If you are with a group looking for meet and drinks, maybe	mwa    queing  very loud music and over rated burgers i went here because my colleagues were raving about this place looking for the best burger around the world it seemed like i had to try this place unfortunately it felt like i was in san francisco to que outside  even as a single person  and there is not much i dislike more than that  inside it is very dark and very loud  apparently they have their own 24 7 radio station with random music  and not very clear what you have to do  some people do have to que at the bar  others are seated and can order there  the please must be great for groups  because you can sit  drink and shout all that you want there were only 2 beers on the menu  which is very disappointing  they come in cans and a frozen glass  the glass was very nice  keeps the beer nice and chilled the burger i ordered was the cheese bacon medium rare  when i got the burger  it wasn t really medium rare  rather medium well and it had a very strong smoke taste  the bun was good  patty nice and thick  though a bit on the dry side  and the sauce ok  all and all an average burger which doesn t score very high on my  best burger of the world list  as a side i ordered the chili fries  with meat   this was a good option  i liked them a lot  fries were nice and crisp  in the beginning  and the sauce and meat had a very nice flavour  this actually saved the meal  without the fries i would rated the place 2 stars when i ordered a second beer  they messed up the order and i never received it  when i told the waitress she was great and took the first beer of the bill   would i go back  don t think sowould i recommend  if you are with a group looking for meet and drinks  maybe
1986	4.0	Meat Liquor? 'Tis exactly what I received. After a long week, our group was in search of indulgences. I needed a drink. We needed lunch. We needed a lot of things. Despite the dark interior (and exterior...I suppose, it is London) and 20 minute wait midafternoon on a Friday..the service our large group (10) received was actually quite superb. I spoke with 4-5 folks affiliated with Meat Liquor and all were helpful despite the crowds and pace of the lunch rush. In particular, our bartender was a gem. Wink, wink. Cute, too. Ahem, sorry. He also made great drinks. The Henrietta Fizz was not overly sweet and just the kick I needed to power through the rest of the afternoon. After being seated we quickly got our appetizers sorted (thanks Kevin L) and to our table quickly arrived onion rings that appeared to be DONUTS, piles of french fries topped with any/every unhealthy topping imaginable (Philly cheesteak fries? heart attack fries), chicken wings, and the list goes on. We ordered and I opted for the Dirty Chicken Burger...which is a fried chicken sandwich burger with all the trimmings, which seems to also mean a pound of mayonnaise. They all arrive on a tray, and unfortunately despite the good attempt they did forget one of our burgers...bummer. We obviously had more than enough food to go around so no harm, but still...our gal pal really wanted that bacon cheeseburger! All in all, it's an American-esque type burger establishment that seems to be quite popular. The food is heavy, greasy...just the way everyone likes it and the service was lovely. We got our fill, and then dragged ourselves through the rest of the day in hopes of stretchy pants and a long couch on which to recover. It is not health food. Obviously. Beware the wait times, but find yourself in a smallish group at an off time and you'll be fine. Once you do get seated things fly out quickly, so just figure out your order while you wait and grab a cocktail, you'll be in great shape.	meat liquor   tis exactly what i received  after a long week  our group was in search of indulgences  i needed a drink  we needed lunch  we needed a lot of things  despite the dark interior  and exterior   i suppose  it is london  and 20 minute wait midafternoon on a friday  the service our large group  10  received was actually quite superb  i spoke with 4 5 folks affiliated with meat liquor and all were helpful despite the crowds and pace of the lunch rush  in particular  our bartender was a gem  wink  wink  cute  too  ahem  sorry  he also made great drinks  the henrietta fizz was not overly sweet and just the kick i needed to power through the rest of the afternoon  after being seated we quickly got our appetizers sorted  thanks kevin l  and to our table quickly arrived onion rings that appeared to be donuts  piles of french fries topped with any every unhealthy topping imaginable  philly cheesteak fries  heart attack fries   chicken wings  and the list goes on  we ordered and i opted for the dirty chicken burger   which is a fried chicken sandwich burger with all the trimmings  which seems to also mean a pound of mayonnaise  they all arrive on a tray  and unfortunately despite the good attempt they did forget one of our burgers   bummer  we obviously had more than enough food to go around so no harm  but still   our gal pal really wanted that bacon cheeseburger  all in all  it s an american esque type burger establishment that seems to be quite popular  the food is heavy  greasy   just the way everyone likes it and the service was lovely  we got our fill  and then dragged ourselves through the rest of the day in hopes of stretchy pants and a long couch on which to recover  it is not health food  obviously  beware the wait times  but find yourself in a smallish group at an off time and you ll be fine  once you do get seated things fly out quickly  so just figure out your order while you wait and grab a cocktail  you ll be in great shape 
1987	4.0	As my birthday was fast approaching, I knew I wanted something fun, crazy, cool. Normally I'm all for nice, clean restaurants with dishes you can't pronounce and waiters serving you in suits, but for my birthday, I wanted something different. I wanted something dirty. I wanted Meatliquor.We expected lines and were prepared to wait, but time flew. We were in line for 20 minutes but had fun talking to the other people around. Since we were a big group, we got divided into smaller groups since there wasn't a table big enough for 10 people. We didn't really mind though. I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of Meatliquor. Graffiti walls, blood splatters, grungey music, fishnets and laughter filled the whole place. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant under the dome that had these crazy animal murals painted on them. It was great. With nothing but paper towels to help me out, I knew it was about to get real. I had just ordered a cheeseburger because I'm a Plain Jane when it comes to my burgers along with some fries. They were both heavenly, greasy perfection. I knew my arteries would never be the same, but I enjoyed every last morsel of that dirty, grimy, slimy burger, as did everyone else who I was with. Meatliquor is an experience, one that I will never forget.	as my birthday was fast approaching  i knew i wanted something fun  crazy  cool  normally i m all for nice  clean restaurants with dishes you can t pronounce and waiters serving you in suits  but for my birthday  i wanted something different  i wanted something dirty  i wanted meatliquor we expected lines and were prepared to wait  but time flew  we were in line for 20 minutes but had fun talking to the other people around  since we were a big group  we got divided into smaller groups since there wasn t a table big enough for 10 people  we didn t really mind though  i absolutely love the atmosphere of meatliquor  graffiti walls  blood splatters  grungey music  fishnets and laughter filled the whole place  we were seated right in the middle of the restaurant under the dome that had these crazy animal murals painted on them  it was great  with nothing but paper towels to help me out  i knew it was about to get real  i had just ordered a cheeseburger because i m a plain jane when it comes to my burgers along with some fries  they were both heavenly  greasy perfection  i knew my arteries would never be the same  but i enjoyed every last morsel of that dirty  grimy  slimy burger  as did everyone else who i was with  meatliquor is an experience  one that i will never forget 
1988	4.0	Made the trip from Montreal, QC to try out Meat Liquor and I was not disappointed. I ordered monkey fingers, dead hippie burger and fries and it was all very delicious. I do have to say that I was very disappointed by my filth pie dessert, not at all what I had imagined but overall had a great time.	made the trip from montreal  qc to try out meat liquor and i was not disappointed  i ordered monkey fingers  dead hippie burger and fries and it was all very delicious  i do have to say that i was very disappointed by my filth pie dessert  not at all what i had imagined but overall had a great time 
1989	4.0	The ambience of MEATliquor is something of an experience, with red lights and decor to resemble a slaughter house; this is not the place for a vegetarian to go. (Although they do have 1-2 meat free options).We waited less than most people do, and although it felt a bit long, it was nice to stand at the bar and chat with friends. If you're in a hurry, this is not the place for you. Food wise it is greasy as all other reviews say, to the point where you are given a kitchen towel roll to wipe your hands and arms as the grease goes everywhere. My personal favourite was the Bingo Wings, and I would be happy to go there just to have those wings again. They are a must to try!It's not as expensive as you think it would be, with the burgers ranging from £6.50 - £9, and they are filling.All in all it is a nice experience with friends, but you need to have extra time on your hands, and be ready for some greasy hands as well.	the ambience of meatliquor is something of an experience  with red lights and decor to resemble a slaughter house  this is not the place for a vegetarian to go   although they do have 1 2 meat free options  we waited less than most people do  and although it felt a bit long  it was nice to stand at the bar and chat with friends  if you re in a hurry  this is not the place for you  food wise it is greasy as all other reviews say  to the point where you are given a kitchen towel roll to wipe your hands and arms as the grease goes everywhere  my personal favourite was the bingo wings  and i would be happy to go there just to have those wings again  they are a must to try it s not as expensive as you think it would be  with the burgers ranging from  6 50    9  and they are filling all in all it is a nice experience with friends  but you need to have extra time on your hands  and be ready for some greasy hands as well 
1990	4.0	Hunger, exhaustion and a grey grey London day brought us to this place. A ark of meat awaited and floated us all back to the office in need of a wee lie down and some vegetables... Moo!After a fairly wait for a table (we were a large group mind) we were settled promptly and assaulted with amazing grub that probably wiped a few years off my life, but made me smile all the same. Everything in this place is just decadent. The donut sized onion rings, the mountains of fries topped with chili/cheese/both/everything... and that was just the starter. Ok, so this is a burger joint fashioned on the get it meaty, get it durty US style burger joint. It kinda feels like what Mc Donald's would be if it took up herion and started listening to death metal... but in a good way. Service? Swift. Friendly. Grub. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! That is all. You may leave now.	hunger  exhaustion and a grey grey london day brought us to this place  a ark of meat awaited and floated us all back to the office in need of a wee lie down and some vegetables    moo after a fairly wait for a table  we were a large group mind  we were settled promptly and assaulted with amazing grub that probably wiped a few years off my life  but made me smile all the same  everything in this place is just decadent  the donut sized onion rings  the mountains of fries topped with chili cheese both everything    and that was just the starter  ok  so this is a burger joint fashioned on the get it meaty  get it durty us style burger joint  it kinda feels like what mc donald s would be if it took up herion and started listening to death metal    but in a good way  service  swift  friendly  grub  moooooooooooooooo  that is all  you may leave now 
1991	2.0	*Sigh...*I wanted to love you, Meat Liquor.  You had so much promise.  I heard so many lovely things about you from other yelpers.  Why'd you have to go and break my heart?So everyone knows about the queue.  It's out of control.  But after several attempts at going to Meat Liquor, I finally had a friend with me who was willing to brave the line in the cold.  What they don't tell you, is that once you've waited in said line, making it through the doors, thinking you're about to be rewarded with meaty, cheesy goodness... you have to put your name on a list and wait at the bar.  Ugh!My name was finally called, and the gent leading us to our table stopped at another table on the way and had about a 2 minute conversation.  Um... did you forget you were in the middle of leading us somewhere?  Perhaps to a table where we could get food after waiting an hour and a half?Finally seated... where's a waiter? Um... hmm.  5 minutes... 10 minutes... Oh look, that must be ALL THE WAITSTAFF watching/timing some guy doing the triple chili challenge!  How helpful!  One of the hostesses managed to make eye contact with me and asked if we were ready to order.  Sent a waiter over, who I assume was meant to be our waiter the whole night.  Didn't even say anything to us as we ordered.  Food comes out, friend's burger is incorrect.  Oh great.  Now we have to find our elusive waiter to tell him the order is wrong.  Or, maybe we'll have to wait five minutes, give up, and go hunt down some OTHER waiter to tell him.  Look.  Long story short, the service is abysmal.  Downright abysmal.As for the burger, I had the Dead Hippie, and well... it was a burger.  It was aiiiiiiiight.  I really don't have anything to say about it aside from that.  It was a burger, and it tasted decent, and hence the two stars.  I was SO delighted to see chili cheese fries on the menu.  SO DELIGHTED.  Hey, Meat Liquor?  Chili should not be sweet.  Not.  Ever.*double sigh...*	 sigh    i wanted to love you  meat liquor   you had so much promise   i heard so many lovely things about you from other yelpers   why d you have to go and break my heart so everyone knows about the queue   it s out of control   but after several attempts at going to meat liquor  i finally had a friend with me who was willing to brave the line in the cold   what they don t tell you  is that once you ve waited in said line  making it through the doors  thinking you re about to be rewarded with meaty  cheesy goodness    you have to put your name on a list and wait at the bar   ugh my name was finally called  and the gent leading us to our table stopped at another table on the way and had about a 2 minute conversation   um    did you forget you were in the middle of leading us somewhere   perhaps to a table where we could get food after waiting an hour and a half finally seated    where s a waiter  um    hmm   5 minutes    10 minutes    oh look  that must be all the waitstaff watching timing some guy doing the triple chili challenge   how helpful   one of the hostesses managed to make eye contact with me and asked if we were ready to order   sent a waiter over  who i assume was meant to be our waiter the whole night   didn t even say anything to us as we ordered   food comes out  friend s burger is incorrect   oh great   now we have to find our elusive waiter to tell him the order is wrong   or  maybe we ll have to wait five minutes  give up  and go hunt down some other waiter to tell him   look   long story short  the service is abysmal   downright abysmal as for the burger  i had the dead hippie  and well    it was a burger   it was aiiiiiiiight   i really don t have anything to say about it aside from that   it was a burger  and it tasted decent  and hence the two stars   i was so delighted to see chili cheese fries on the menu   so delighted   hey  meat liquor   chili should not be sweet   not   ever  double sigh    
1992	4.0	"Let's just get this out of the way.  If there is a better burger in London than the Dead Hippie burger at Meat Liquor, I'm going to be stunned.  While I'm not going as far as one of my ex-pat friends who claimed it was better than burgers in Texas (blasphemy and inaccurate to boot), Meat Liquor's burger is surprisingly good.  Deliciously juicy, the burger is dripping with a homemade mayo based sauce that intensifies the flavor of the meat.  Most people who like this eatery state you should order the Dead Hippie burger.  I tend to agree with the masses on this one.  It's a legitimately good burger.  As my friend Kevin L. mentioned, the liquor menu here leaves a bit to be desired.  They weren't even able to make the drink that I attempted to order off their menu claiming they were ""out"" of the right ingredients.  While normally this wouldn't bother me, Meat Liquor had been open for no more than 2 hours that day.  They serve for another 6-8 hours.  So either they have an enormous sourcing issue or they are being untruthful.  Both conclusions are negative.  Having said all that, I ended up ordering a non-alcoholic shake, and it was delicious.  So if you get a burger and shake, you'll probably be happy.  I would avoid the chili cheese fries.  When I claim that I miss Tex-Mex, people wonder how anyone can screw up beef, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sour cream, and guacamole combinations.  Some would make the same claim about chili cheese fries.  Meat Liquor makes chili cheese fries like people not from Texas makes Tex-Mex.  If you still want to order the fries, do so at your own peril.  You've been warned.  The atmosphere at Meat Liquor is some odd mixture of bordello and goth.  If this was supposed to remind me of the States, it failed.  In the end, all that really matters is that Meat Liquor has satisfying good burgers that have the ability to suppress the craving for dead cow.  They sufficiently pass that test so 4 big ole Yelp stars for them."	let s just get this out of the way   if there is a better burger in london than the dead hippie burger at meat liquor  i m going to be stunned   while i m not going as far as one of my ex pat friends who claimed it was better than burgers in texas  blasphemy and inaccurate to boot   meat liquor s burger is surprisingly good   deliciously juicy  the burger is dripping with a homemade mayo based sauce that intensifies the flavor of the meat   most people who like this eatery state you should order the dead hippie burger   i tend to agree with the masses on this one   it s a legitimately good burger   as my friend kevin l  mentioned  the liquor menu here leaves a bit to be desired   they weren t even able to make the drink that i attempted to order off their menu claiming they were  out  of the right ingredients   while normally this wouldn t bother me  meat liquor had been open for no more than 2 hours that day   they serve for another 6 8 hours   so either they have an enormous sourcing issue or they are being untruthful   both conclusions are negative   having said all that  i ended up ordering a non alcoholic shake  and it was delicious   so if you get a burger and shake  you ll probably be happy   i would avoid the chili cheese fries   when i claim that i miss tex mex  people wonder how anyone can screw up beef  cheese  lettuce  tomatoes  onions  sour cream  and guacamole combinations   some would make the same claim about chili cheese fries   meat liquor makes chili cheese fries like people not from texas makes tex mex   if you still want to order the fries  do so at your own peril   you ve been warned   the atmosphere at meat liquor is some odd mixture of bordello and goth   if this was supposed to remind me of the states  it failed   in the end  all that really matters is that meat liquor has satisfying good burgers that have the ability to suppress the craving for dead cow   they sufficiently pass that test so 4 big ole yelp stars for them 
1993	4.0	And so I came to Meat Liquor, to check what the was was all about...And I understood : it's all about greasy, fatty foodstuff... and the Queue !!!I gotta say, after 40 minutes in the queue, I was surprised we needed to wait again when inside... The deco is very peculiar, quite gothic and dark... I enjoyed it !The beers were quite small for their price (however, matched completely with the relatively low price of the food thereafter...). The food, then, was as I suspected: more fatty than tasty (I wonder who gets some onion rings on the menu, after you've eaten a couple of those calorie bombs while queing outside...), the burgers were well cooked though, and my Philly cheese steak was OK. The sides were great, and we loved the chicked wings, and the cheesy fries.I'm still wondering though, how we managed to eat it all...	and so i came to meat liquor  to check what the was was all about   and i understood   it s all about greasy  fatty foodstuff    and the queue    i gotta say  after 40 minutes in the queue  i was surprised we needed to wait again when inside    the deco is very peculiar  quite gothic and dark    i enjoyed it  the beers were quite small for their price  however  matched completely with the relatively low price of the food thereafter      the food  then  was as i suspected  more fatty than tasty  i wonder who gets some onion rings on the menu  after you ve eaten a couple of those calorie bombs while queing outside      the burgers were well cooked though  and my philly cheese steak was ok  the sides were great  and we loved the chicked wings  and the cheesy fries i m still wondering though  how we managed to eat it all   
1994	4.0	"It's a long wait for a burger and fries. It does feel like a rock 'n roll nightclub inside, though. They have greasy versions of everything, and you can get a ""Philly Cheesesteak"" version of everything. The wings aren't bad, the burger are pretty solid, and the drinks are outstanding. Try the apricot jam.I was nauseous after eating here.As an American, I love these kinds of places, because they are caricatures of America. For the Brits, it's novelty. For me, it's just plain old American marketing."	it s a long wait for a burger and fries  it does feel like a rock  n roll nightclub inside  though  they have greasy versions of everything  and you can get a  philly cheesesteak  version of everything  the wings aren t bad  the burger are pretty solid  and the drinks are outstanding  try the apricot jam i was nauseous after eating here as an american  i love these kinds of places  because they are caricatures of america  for the brits  it s novelty  for me  it s just plain old american marketing 
1995	3.0	So this place is cool. Not like I think it is cool (which I do), but like, this place knows it is cool, wears cool like a coat and would not be caught dead with uncool staff or uncool music or uncool anything, ever.And that is why you line up outside for an hour.The food is like super greasy late-night munchy food, and I do not say that as a bad thing. Deep fried pickles, and cheesey onion fries are an essential side order, and your whole meal is served up on a tray for the whole table, no plates here. If Man Vs Food did a UK version, he would definitely do a bit in Meat & Liquor. So do not be expecting gourmet lean beef patties or anything. The cocktail offering is amazing, but the names of the cocktails are wildly offensive in an attempt to be edgy. I hated myself for ordering a 'Donkey Punch'.Visit for the atmosphere, not for the fine dining, but give it a go all the same.	so this place is cool  not like i think it is cool  which i do   but like  this place knows it is cool  wears cool like a coat and would not be caught dead with uncool staff or uncool music or uncool anything  ever and that is why you line up outside for an hour the food is like super greasy late night munchy food  and i do not say that as a bad thing  deep fried pickles  and cheesey onion fries are an essential side order  and your whole meal is served up on a tray for the whole table  no plates here  if man vs food did a uk version  he would definitely do a bit in meat   liquor  so do not be expecting gourmet lean beef patties or anything  the cocktail offering is amazing  but the names of the cocktails are wildly offensive in an attempt to be edgy  i hated myself for ordering a  donkey punch  visit for the atmosphere  not for the fine dining  but give it a go all the same 
1996	3.0	Ok so I convinced my mates to queue for up to 2 hours for a burger. I told them magical stories of wonderful burgers to rival any in LA and they fell for it. We went, we queued and lets just say things got a little tense. We were hungry, half-drunk and impatient. We had a stamp on our wrists that simply said FOOD but we hadn't had a sniff of anything for an hour. We finally got inside and went over to the bar where we experienced the most awful foulness ever imaginable. Don't remember the name but it was a bottle of cider (the only cider) and I nearly went home. The beers weren't much better either. Actually they didn't even have beer just some crappy lager charged at 4.5 quid. It wasn't looking good.We got to our table and was greeted with the most miserable waitress ever who got the hump at just a few questions. Then she said she wasn't having a good day and went off. Listen darling I'm not having a good year but I still smile and have (some) manners.Anyway the food finally came on a large metal tray which amused us and we tucked in. The cheeseburger I ordered was damn good, in fact it was one of the best I had since my return from LA. We ordered a bunch of sides with mixed feelings. The fries were way to salty, the slaw had no flavour but the onion rings were the dogs. Best rings in town and cut like a car tyre. Good reports about the mushroom Swiss burger my mates had. All in all a good experience as the atmosphere was pretty fun and I liked the rock n roll soundtrack and graffiti art on the walls. I'm not sure I would queue again for that long while hungry, perhaps if I had a snack I would. A good effort, a great burger but I still think Meat Liquor could be better.	ok so i convinced my mates to queue for up to 2 hours for a burger  i told them magical stories of wonderful burgers to rival any in la and they fell for it  we went  we queued and lets just say things got a little tense  we were hungry  half drunk and impatient  we had a stamp on our wrists that simply said food but we hadn t had a sniff of anything for an hour  we finally got inside and went over to the bar where we experienced the most awful foulness ever imaginable  don t remember the name but it was a bottle of cider  the only cider  and i nearly went home  the beers weren t much better either  actually they didn t even have beer just some crappy lager charged at 4 5 quid  it wasn t looking good we got to our table and was greeted with the most miserable waitress ever who got the hump at just a few questions  then she said she wasn t having a good day and went off  listen darling i m not having a good year but i still smile and have  some  manners anyway the food finally came on a large metal tray which amused us and we tucked in  the cheeseburger i ordered was damn good  in fact it was one of the best i had since my return from la  we ordered a bunch of sides with mixed feelings  the fries were way to salty  the slaw had no flavour but the onion rings were the dogs  best rings in town and cut like a car tyre  good reports about the mushroom swiss burger my mates had  all in all a good experience as the atmosphere was pretty fun and i liked the rock n roll soundtrack and graffiti art on the walls  i m not sure i would queue again for that long while hungry  perhaps if i had a snack i would  a good effort  a great burger but i still think meat liquor could be better 
1997	4.0	Really really fun experience all together. Yes, we had to wait in line - excuse me, QUEUE - for an hour and a half. Find people you don't mind talking to for long periods of time, shouldn't be too hard.American food, kinda nailed it. Decent burgers, good wings, GREAT chili cheese fries. And I am a huge sucker for chili cheese fries. They put mustard on theirs which seemed weird to me at first but it totally works. I would probably go back just for the chili cheese fries.Fun cocktails. I basically had an alcoholic mango smoothie and it was excellent. There are tons of other fun, creative cocktails to choose from.I could do without the super loud, clubby atmosphere. Weird, gothic interior, dark, with black room photography type lights. INSANELY LOUD. It might have been turning into a club in the middle of our dinner, not really sure. You can't talk to people, so it's a good thing you said everything you wanted to say to your friends in the queue.	really really fun experience all together  yes  we had to wait in line   excuse me  queue   for an hour and a half  find people you don t mind talking to for long periods of time  shouldn t be too hard american food  kinda nailed it  decent burgers  good wings  great chili cheese fries  and i am a huge sucker for chili cheese fries  they put mustard on theirs which seemed weird to me at first but it totally works  i would probably go back just for the chili cheese fries fun cocktails  i basically had an alcoholic mango smoothie and it was excellent  there are tons of other fun  creative cocktails to choose from i could do without the super loud  clubby atmosphere  weird  gothic interior  dark  with black room photography type lights  insanely loud  it might have been turning into a club in the middle of our dinner  not really sure  you can t talk to people  so it s a good thing you said everything you wanted to say to your friends in the queue 
1998	4.0	I had heard of massive queues outside Meat Liquor but I was lucky that I didn't have to stand in one myself until the last time I went there.  I was quite pleasantly surprised, whilst standing in the queues, when one of the servers came outside with a plate of onion rings and pickle and offered it to all the people outside.My all-time favourite at Meat Liquor is their Buffalo chicken burger. It's massive, it's smothered with blue cheese and the chicken is crisp and cooked to perfection. I quite liked the dead hippie burger as well. The chilli cheese fries compliments the burger really well too.I don't quite understand why the place is too dimly lit, it restricts you from admiring your gorgeous plateful. Also I had 'No Brainer' and a cocktail with my burger which I didn't enjoy at all. It was pricey and it didn't taste very nice. I wish they had more familiar beer brands as well.	i had heard of massive queues outside meat liquor but i was lucky that i didn t have to stand in one myself until the last time i went there   i was quite pleasantly surprised  whilst standing in the queues  when one of the servers came outside with a plate of onion rings and pickle and offered it to all the people outside my all time favourite at meat liquor is their buffalo chicken burger  it s massive  it s smothered with blue cheese and the chicken is crisp and cooked to perfection  i quite liked the dead hippie burger as well  the chilli cheese fries compliments the burger really well too i don t quite understand why the place is too dimly lit  it restricts you from admiring your gorgeous plateful  also i had  no brainer  and a cocktail with my burger which i didn t enjoy at all  it was pricey and it didn t taste very nice  i wish they had more familiar beer brands as well 
1999	3.0	"Meat Liquor is everything you want a burger joint to be provided that you just want to rock out to a burger, boom out some lyrics, and don't the feel an overwhelming urge to have a serious conversation with the people next to you.The first permanent MEATfamily location, it boasts a considerable number of seats that are perpetually full. Event at almost 10pm on a Tuesday night, there was a 15 minute wait for a table and the place was jumping. There is a full bar or you can go for beer in 330ml cans (something I thought you'd couldn't get on this side of the pond). The décor is more satanic heavy metal rock than anything else with some truly disturbing murals on the walls and ceilings.Being the older of the siblings (compared to MeatMarket), ML does have more things on the menu like buffalo wings and deep fried pickles plus a few more burgers to entice you. Kevin L raved about the wings so of course we had to get them. I'll give ML credit - they were good wings. The buffalo sauce was hot and tangy and the blue cheese dip acted as the perfect balance. Oh hot wings, how I've missed you! Pickles aren't my thing but given the speed they disappeared I gather they were pretty tasty too. Other starters included chilli cheese fries and pulled pork covered fries, both of which were awesome although quite filling.For my burger, I opted for the chilli burger in order to give the MEATfamily a second chance after my appetite-killing experience with the Dead Hippie at MeatMarket. This time I was much happier with a juicy tender patty covered in jalapenos and perhaps the odd green chilli. The bun was a win as usual and stayed soft while absorbing a good amount of juices. They also do a Chilli Challenge where you have to try to eat a chiliburger, a chilidog, and a big bowls of chilli cheese fries. I've got to say I'm pretty tempted by this although most likely in November once the races are done for the year. The fastest time is 3.45 which is a bit insane although something of a ""goal"" to aim for.Overall, an enjoyable meal and a pretty solid burger. It's changed my opinion of the MEATfamily food (although not of the Dead Hippie sauce) however I think I'd opt for takeaway rather than the chaos of the interior. Worth going once for the experience, the 2nd time I'd rather eat in peace and have a chat without risking my voice."	meat liquor is everything you want a burger joint to be provided that you just want to rock out to a burger  boom out some lyrics  and don t the feel an overwhelming urge to have a serious conversation with the people next to you the first permanent meatfamily location  it boasts a considerable number of seats that are perpetually full  event at almost 10pm on a tuesday night  there was a 15 minute wait for a table and the place was jumping  there is a full bar or you can go for beer in 330ml cans  something i thought you d couldn t get on this side of the pond   the d cor is more satanic heavy metal rock than anything else with some truly disturbing murals on the walls and ceilings being the older of the siblings  compared to meatmarket   ml does have more things on the menu like buffalo wings and deep fried pickles plus a few more burgers to entice you  kevin l raved about the wings so of course we had to get them  i ll give ml credit   they were good wings  the buffalo sauce was hot and tangy and the blue cheese dip acted as the perfect balance  oh hot wings  how i ve missed you  pickles aren t my thing but given the speed they disappeared i gather they were pretty tasty too  other starters included chilli cheese fries and pulled pork covered fries  both of which were awesome although quite filling for my burger  i opted for the chilli burger in order to give the meatfamily a second chance after my appetite killing experience with the dead hippie at meatmarket  this time i was much happier with a juicy tender patty covered in jalapenos and perhaps the odd green chilli  the bun was a win as usual and stayed soft while absorbing a good amount of juices  they also do a chilli challenge where you have to try to eat a chiliburger  a chilidog  and a big bowls of chilli cheese fries  i ve got to say i m pretty tempted by this although most likely in november once the races are done for the year  the fastest time is 3 45 which is a bit insane although something of a  goal  to aim for overall  an enjoyable meal and a pretty solid burger  it s changed my opinion of the meatfamily food  although not of the dead hippie sauce  however i think i d opt for takeaway rather than the chaos of the interior  worth going once for the experience  the 2nd time i d rather eat in peace and have a chat without risking my voice 
2000	4.0	This is how burgers should be. As a Man v Food style lover of dining, I love a place with the paper towels, sauces on the table, get up and go process. The burgers are fun. The meat is good and tasty but not gourmet (and has no pretence to claim to be I think) The dill pickles are awesome and wings are good (but not great) The jam jar cocktails are awesome too! A fun place for a group but obvious no bookings for this pop up style favourite	this is how burgers should be  as a man v food style lover of dining  i love a place with the paper towels  sauces on the table  get up and go process  the burgers are fun  the meat is good and tasty but not gourmet  and has no pretence to claim to be i think  the dill pickles are awesome and wings are good  but not great  the jam jar cocktails are awesome too  a fun place for a group but obvious no bookings for this pop up style favourite
2001	3.0	This is review of the food not the atmosphere which gets a higher rating. I ordered the cheese burger and onion rings both came warm not hot onion rings were unique very crispy shame they were not hot. Burger was nothing to write home about. Blue cheese dip and hippie sauce not much to say. If you haven't anyplace other to go then ye but not worth the queue and wait. Thing that I hated is that they added a pound to your bill for some charity they are involved in with out the waitresses even telling you before hand the only indication is on your bill and on a small note at your your table briefly explaining what the charity about. I don't think it's fair to pressure peoples into paying towards a charity they don't know enough about and well putting them on the spot charity is to be given not taken. Atmosphere 4.5/5 -- food 3/5 -- ethics 0/5. I give donation charity to the ones I know about and have done research on not at restaurants with brief explanations and put on the spot tactics.	this is review of the food not the atmosphere which gets a higher rating  i ordered the cheese burger and onion rings both came warm not hot onion rings were unique very crispy shame they were not hot  burger was nothing to write home about  blue cheese dip and hippie sauce not much to say  if you haven t anyplace other to go then ye but not worth the queue and wait  thing that i hated is that they added a pound to your bill for some charity they are involved in with out the waitresses even telling you before hand the only indication is on your bill and on a small note at your your table briefly explaining what the charity about  i don t think it s fair to pressure peoples into paying towards a charity they don t know enough about and well putting them on the spot charity is to be given not taken  atmosphere 4 5 5    food 3 5    ethics 0 5  i give donation charity to the ones i know about and have done research on not at restaurants with brief explanations and put on the spot tactics 
2002	4.0	So, this isn't the most tasteful place you'd take your friends. You'd have to take the more tolerant ones. Why? Because the interior is designed to look a bit like a slaughterhouse with blood stained plastic curtains and a wall that screams DEATH! But the food is great, so let's not let PETA hear about this place. M'KAY! So, verdict? (despite the questionable decor)BEST.BURGER.EVER. LOVE.THE.WINGS.Yeah. Big words. But the dead hippy burger, in all the meat drippings was JUST.SO.GOOD. Can't even. Just try it. I don't know what dead hippy sauce is but it is good. The wings were also faultless, it actually came with a tub of sauce, but that wasn't necessary, the marinade on the wings alone was tasty by itself. (IN YOUR FACE COLONEL SANDERS) The chilli cheese fries beat us though, it was just too much. Probably just stick to the normal fries next time. (I did give it a great shot-man vs food style, but it was just too mammoth.) I'm a bit peeved with myself that i didn't beat the food so that's why its only 4 stars. So it's a bit pricy for a burger, but in comparison to GBK or even Byron, it's actually a little bit cheaper (Byron's are just under tenner, I think!) But SO worth it.You'll bet I'll be back...(Went here for lunch so service wasn't so bad)	so  this isn t the most tasteful place you d take your friends  you d have to take the more tolerant ones  why  because the interior is designed to look a bit like a slaughterhouse with blood stained plastic curtains and a wall that screams death  but the food is great  so let s not let peta hear about this place  m kay  so  verdict   despite the questionable decor best burger ever  love the wings yeah  big words  but the dead hippy burger  in all the meat drippings was just so good  can t even  just try it  i don t know what dead hippy sauce is but it is good  the wings were also faultless  it actually came with a tub of sauce  but that wasn t necessary  the marinade on the wings alone was tasty by itself   in your face colonel sanders  the chilli cheese fries beat us though  it was just too much  probably just stick to the normal fries next time   i did give it a great shot man vs food style  but it was just too mammoth   i m a bit peeved with myself that i didn t beat the food so that s why its only 4 stars  so it s a bit pricy for a burger  but in comparison to gbk or even byron  it s actually a little bit cheaper  byron s are just under tenner  i think   but so worth it you ll bet i ll be back    went here for lunch so service wasn t so bad 
2003	5.0	The food in this restaurant is perfect. If you're planning to go there you have to try the buffalo chicken wings it is amazing. I strongly recommend this place for nice food and nice services. The only drawback that I've noticed is the music is too loud:(	the food in this restaurant is perfect  if you re planning to go there you have to try the buffalo chicken wings it is amazing  i strongly recommend this place for nice food and nice services  the only drawback that i ve noticed is the music is too loud  
2004	5.0	Totally blown away. My American friend was blown away and had to continually remind himself that he wasn't back home and he was still in London. Greeted at the door by a pleasant but forceful lady, we were given the chance to sit at the bar until a space can available. It wasn't long before we were munching on chill cheese fries, Philly cheese steak and a cheese burger. Naturally we couldn't finish it all but boy did we try. Cocktails were a great addition to the meal. We left satisfied to say the least!	totally blown away  my american friend was blown away and had to continually remind himself that he wasn t back home and he was still in london  greeted at the door by a pleasant but forceful lady  we were given the chance to sit at the bar until a space can available  it wasn t long before we were munching on chill cheese fries  philly cheese steak and a cheese burger  naturally we couldn t finish it all but boy did we try  cocktails were a great addition to the meal  we left satisfied to say the least 
2005	4.0	Pounding pounding techno music... That's what you think when you enter, it's cool and knows it, the queue outside underlying the fact.  I'd been waiting to try this place for ages but couldn't deal with the queueing.  it's worth the wait in many ways, the portions are big, the food well priced, great cocktails.  Just don't go for any conversation, this is all about the food.I went for the Dead Hippie is essentially a Double Double Cheeseburger and consists of two mustard-fried beef patties, American cheese and a special sauce with a ridge of cut pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce. It's an awesome burger, simple and juicy and after a few bites looks like it has all melded together in some mental burger mash up.  The starters and sides are equally good but have no idea what they were called and can't find a menu to tell you...However you get all this and can chat at its sister burger place hidden at the back of the Jubilee market in Covent Garden, Meat Market.  It is a proper burger joint with similar great food and a more chilled atmosphere.  Take your pick, burger mental clubbing madness or chilled burger joint to meet friends in.	pounding pounding techno music    that s what you think when you enter  it s cool and knows it  the queue outside underlying the fact   i d been waiting to try this place for ages but couldn t deal with the queueing   it s worth the wait in many ways  the portions are big  the food well priced  great cocktails   just don t go for any conversation  this is all about the food i went for the dead hippie is essentially a double double cheeseburger and consists of two mustard fried beef patties  american cheese and a special sauce with a ridge of cut pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce  it s an awesome burger  simple and juicy and after a few bites looks like it has all melded together in some mental burger mash up   the starters and sides are equally good but have no idea what they were called and can t find a menu to tell you   however you get all this and can chat at its sister burger place hidden at the back of the jubilee market in covent garden  meat market   it is a proper burger joint with similar great food and a more chilled atmosphere   take your pick  burger mental clubbing madness or chilled burger joint to meet friends in 
2006	4.0	I ordered the cheeseburger at MEATliquor after a long wait outside. The burger was cooked medium, had a good bun, and was topped with melted cheese on the patty. The beef was well represented and outdid the toppings being both juicy, tender, and seared with a perfect crunch on the griddle. Toppings of lettuce, red onion, and the quality bun gave the burger a good texture, however this burger did not quite stack up to the elite despite having a lot going for it. I would highly recommend MEATliquor, but it may not be worth the wait on a very busy night.	i ordered the cheeseburger at meatliquor after a long wait outside  the burger was cooked medium  had a good bun  and was topped with melted cheese on the patty  the beef was well represented and outdid the toppings being both juicy  tender  and seared with a perfect crunch on the griddle  toppings of lettuce  red onion  and the quality bun gave the burger a good texture  however this burger did not quite stack up to the elite despite having a lot going for it  i would highly recommend meatliquor  but it may not be worth the wait on a very busy night 
2007	3.0	I've been a MEATer since back in the day of chasing down the 'Wagon. Those were the magic days, with Yianni at the helm, churning out some truly delicious burgers. Wagon burgers are still the best I've ever had, anywhere.Then came the days of trekking out to New Cross for MeatEasy, getting there before the doors open to have a chance of getting home to north London sometime before midnight. Again, great burgers but it's here the shine wears off a bit.So now we get to MEATLiquor. I'm not a fan of the look and feel of the venue but hey, I'm not there to look around. I have a pretty set order - bacon cheeseburger, and deep fried pickles but I sub the blue cheese dip for hippie sauce. Right now seems to be a good time at ML. The staff are better than when they opened, it's busy enough to feel buzzy but without a constant queue. The food is good but that great edge from the wagon is gone. The bacon isn't quite as bacony, the burger not as luscious, and the deep fried pickles are always a little too salty (but I'm a trooper). Still though, I don't leave hungry!I'm not a big fan of the metal serving trays - they're trendy, I know, but the piece of paper that goes on top of the tray always gets all wet and icky from the juicy burger. I don't want to eat paper... I also think that a burger joint has no business putting a service charge on the bill. You want to know why your wait staff wasn't getting good tips? They were awful. They're better now, but not service charge good. I also did not appreciate the £1 charity donation put on to my bill. I donate to my own charities in my own way, and shouldn't be forced to support or feel shamed if I want it taken off the bill. Between the service charge and charity 'donation', my pickles, bacon cheeseburger, and single coke came to £16.50. Just too expensive to be anything other than a once or twice a year treat. Sure, it's not expensive in the grand scheme of London eating, but without the shine that Yianni brings when behind the grill, it's just that little bit too much to make me feel resentful.	i ve been a meater since back in the day of chasing down the  wagon  those were the magic days  with yianni at the helm  churning out some truly delicious burgers  wagon burgers are still the best i ve ever had  anywhere then came the days of trekking out to new cross for meateasy  getting there before the doors open to have a chance of getting home to north london sometime before midnight  again  great burgers but it s here the shine wears off a bit so now we get to meatliquor  i m not a fan of the look and feel of the venue but hey  i m not there to look around  i have a pretty set order   bacon cheeseburger  and deep fried pickles but i sub the blue cheese dip for hippie sauce  right now seems to be a good time at ml  the staff are better than when they opened  it s busy enough to feel buzzy but without a constant queue  the food is good but that great edge from the wagon is gone  the bacon isn t quite as bacony  the burger not as luscious  and the deep fried pickles are always a little too salty  but i m a trooper   still though  i don t leave hungry i m not a big fan of the metal serving trays   they re trendy  i know  but the piece of paper that goes on top of the tray always gets all wet and icky from the juicy burger  i don t want to eat paper    i also think that a burger joint has no business putting a service charge on the bill  you want to know why your wait staff wasn t getting good tips  they were awful  they re better now  but not service charge good  i also did not appreciate the  1 charity donation put on to my bill  i donate to my own charities in my own way  and shouldn t be forced to support or feel shamed if i want it taken off the bill  between the service charge and charity  donation   my pickles  bacon cheeseburger  and single coke came to  16 50  just too expensive to be anything other than a once or twice a year treat  sure  it s not expensive in the grand scheme of london eating  but without the shine that yianni brings when behind the grill  it s just that little bit too much to make me feel resentful 
2008	3.0	"There were things I liked about Meat Liquor and things I didn't.The first thing I noticed was how dark it is in there. Not ""oh, this is nice low lighting"", more ""oh, it's so dark in here it's almost depressing"". It was 6.30pm when I arrived and it felt like I'd just time travelled to 3am.When our table was ready, the waiter tried to seat us at the uncomfortable bar stools instead of at one of the free tables. So, we had to call him back and ask to be moved. Why didn't he just give us the more comfortable option to start with?Meat Liquor is a little up it's own ass. You can tell that from the huge signs all over the place that put you in your place. Telling you that they won't seat you unless your whole party is there and various other rules and regulations. The type of thing that happens when restaurants become too successful for their own good. You quickly realise that ""the customer is always right"" is not something they're going to subscribe to here. Some of the staff have a ""don't give a s**t what you think"" air about them.It's also one of those places that deliberately makes people queue outside to attract attention, despite the fact there's space inside. One of our friends arrived at the end of our meal to have a quick drink with us. But they wouldn't let him in - despite the fact there was loads of space inside. It's nice and friendly that way.The burgers? Well, they're OK - nothing amazing. One thing I did love though were the frozen beer glasses - that's always a nice touch. Going back? Err, I don't think so."	there were things i liked about meat liquor and things i didn t the first thing i noticed was how dark it is in there  not  oh  this is nice low lighting   more  oh  it s so dark in here it s almost depressing   it was 6 30pm when i arrived and it felt like i d just time travelled to 3am when our table was ready  the waiter tried to seat us at the uncomfortable bar stools instead of at one of the free tables  so  we had to call him back and ask to be moved  why didn t he just give us the more comfortable option to start with meat liquor is a little up it s own ass  you can tell that from the huge signs all over the place that put you in your place  telling you that they won t seat you unless your whole party is there and various other rules and regulations  the type of thing that happens when restaurants become too successful for their own good  you quickly realise that  the customer is always right  is not something they re going to subscribe to here  some of the staff have a  don t give a s  t what you think  air about them it s also one of those places that deliberately makes people queue outside to attract attention  despite the fact there s space inside  one of our friends arrived at the end of our meal to have a quick drink with us  but they wouldn t let him in   despite the fact there was loads of space inside  it s nice and friendly that way the burgers  well  they re ok   nothing amazing  one thing i did love though were the frozen beer glasses   that s always a nice touch  going back  err  i don t think so 
2009	2.0	"I don't get it.After all the hype, for a burger bar, one can only presume it's worth checking out to see what's so great. Now I've been I still don't know. All I gathered was disappointment and a feeling of being just another curious beastie suckered in to the latest fad. Don't believe the hype.The bad start I was expecting - the queue. Bookings aren't taken here. A decent restaurant will give you an approximate waiting time and the option to wait at the bar or come back at an allotted time. The only function of maintaining a queue is an extension of what this place thrives on - hype. It makes Meat Liquor look heavily sought after and this lures others in to wondering what it's all about. We ambled along in the afternoon, so just the 15 minute wait to get inside. Then we discover that there are no tables free so we have to wait at the bar anyway and pay too much for drinks.Aside from their marketing ploys and ability to save money where ever possible, nothing about this place is impressive. The chairs are very much like the rickety, old, uncomfortable school chairs. We had the stools from the science labs. No napkins here at Meat Liquor, you make do with the kitchen roll on every table as your napkin and/or plate as when your burger does (eventually, ours took an unfathomable age) arrive, it doesn't matter how many of you there are, everything will be dumped on one tray and left in between the diners to scramble over and to drag what's yours away. Completely unhelpful and just smacks of cheap inadequacy.The lights are unnecessarily dim and the music is too loud for conversations across a table without raising ones voice to a near shout.THE BURGERS! What everybody raves about! Why? They're just burgers. Good burgers are available in many places. The burgers here are good but certainly not worth any kind of hassle or special effort. My burger was particularly... burgery. Nice though (just nice) and the only reason Meat Liquor receives as much as two stars - for performing it's primary function.I even took issue with the decor. They've opted for, somewhat predictably, a distressed, hipster look which conveniently complies with their desire to spend as little money as possible, furnishing the place with what ever people were going to throw away, unfinished decorating and a general held-together-with-tape look to much of the establishment. Probably why it's so dark inside. The walls and ceiling look a little like an art students first attempt at quirky graffiti.More to complain about - the staff - they're rubbish. Each one we had to deal with carried their own over-inflated sense of self importance but commit fully to applying a lax attitude towards whoever happens to be in the restaurant at the time. Not that they'd be likely to notice you anyway. I'd like to comment on the quality of Liquor (cocktails they offer, apparently) but that's difficult as we had trouble trying to order some. We spent a while trying to gain the attention of someone who ""works"" there but after a time gave up and decided to try our luck elsewhere. Then it took a while to get the bill, of course.Oh, and they use old jam jars as glasses. There is very little about this place and it's attempts at being hip that doesn't irritate me.Why bother?TTFN,Ian"	i don t get it after all the hype  for a burger bar  one can only presume it s worth checking out to see what s so great  now i ve been i still don t know  all i gathered was disappointment and a feeling of being just another curious beastie suckered in to the latest fad  don t believe the hype the bad start i was expecting   the queue  bookings aren t taken here  a decent restaurant will give you an approximate waiting time and the option to wait at the bar or come back at an allotted time  the only function of maintaining a queue is an extension of what this place thrives on   hype  it makes meat liquor look heavily sought after and this lures others in to wondering what it s all about  we ambled along in the afternoon  so just the 15 minute wait to get inside  then we discover that there are no tables free so we have to wait at the bar anyway and pay too much for drinks aside from their marketing ploys and ability to save money where ever possible  nothing about this place is impressive  the chairs are very much like the rickety  old  uncomfortable school chairs  we had the stools from the science labs  no napkins here at meat liquor  you make do with the kitchen roll on every table as your napkin and or plate as when your burger does  eventually  ours took an unfathomable age  arrive  it doesn t matter how many of you there are  everything will be dumped on one tray and left in between the diners to scramble over and to drag what s yours away  completely unhelpful and just smacks of cheap inadequacy the lights are unnecessarily dim and the music is too loud for conversations across a table without raising ones voice to a near shout the burgers  what everybody raves about  why  they re just burgers  good burgers are available in many places  the burgers here are good but certainly not worth any kind of hassle or special effort  my burger was particularly    burgery  nice though  just nice  and the only reason meat liquor receives as much as two stars   for performing it s primary function i even took issue with the decor  they ve opted for  somewhat predictably  a distressed  hipster look which conveniently complies with their desire to spend as little money as possible  furnishing the place with what ever people were going to throw away  unfinished decorating and a general held together with tape look to much of the establishment  probably why it s so dark inside  the walls and ceiling look a little like an art students first attempt at quirky graffiti more to complain about   the staff   they re rubbish  each one we had to deal with carried their own over inflated sense of self importance but commit fully to applying a lax attitude towards whoever happens to be in the restaurant at the time  not that they d be likely to notice you anyway  i d like to comment on the quality of liquor  cocktails they offer  apparently  but that s difficult as we had trouble trying to order some  we spent a while trying to gain the attention of someone who  works  there but after a time gave up and decided to try our luck elsewhere  then it took a while to get the bill  of course oh  and they use old jam jars as glasses  there is very little about this place and it s attempts at being hip that doesn t irritate me why bother ttfn ian

2013	2.0	"Meh, it's ok but not outstanding. I think the ""Texas steakhouse goth"" décor put me off (trying just a bit too hard to be edgy-cool, me thinks). And not to mention my burger was dry and flavorless, a monumental let down. We came on a Saturday at 330p to avoid any waiting and it worked. The food came out quickly but service overall was inattentive (I made a point to say we were sharing the cheese fries, but were only given one fork; my husband asked for his burger sans pickle and mustard but it came with; I asked for my burger done medium-well but it was very, very pink). I was probably most impressed by the chili cheese fries than anything else. Not a soppy, soggy and greasy mess but with thin-cut, American style fries that managed to stay crispy the entire 25 minutes it took us to eat it (we had to share that fork, remember?). The chili was flavorful and provolone as the cheese of choice was unexpected in a good way. The music started out great with vintage country (Hank Williams, Willie Nelson type stuff) that suited the dark, off beat atmosphere, but soon declined into the kitschy, familiar 50s doo wop of every other ""American Diner"" in London. IF I came back (and I would certainly not wait an hour-plus to come for dinner) I would probably skip the burgers and go for a chili dog or Philly cheese steak."	meh  it s ok but not outstanding  i think the  texas steakhouse goth  d cor put me off  trying just a bit too hard to be edgy cool  me thinks   and not to mention my burger was dry and flavorless  a monumental let down  we came on a saturday at 330p to avoid any waiting and it worked  the food came out quickly but service overall was inattentive  i made a point to say we were sharing the cheese fries  but were only given one fork  my husband asked for his burger sans pickle and mustard but it came with  i asked for my burger done medium well but it was very  very pink   i was probably most impressed by the chili cheese fries than anything else  not a soppy  soggy and greasy mess but with thin cut  american style fries that managed to stay crispy the entire 25 minutes it took us to eat it  we had to share that fork  remember    the chili was flavorful and provolone as the cheese of choice was unexpected in a good way  the music started out great with vintage country  hank williams  willie nelson type stuff  that suited the dark  off beat atmosphere  but soon declined into the kitschy  familiar 50s doo wop of every other  american diner  in london  if i came back  and i would certainly not wait an hour plus to come for dinner  i would probably skip the burgers and go for a chili dog or philly cheese steak 
2014	3.0	Oooh, if I look at this place as somewhere I just wandered into during a shopping trip to refuel I reckon it's pretty good. When I look at it as a restaurant which has been flogged to death and pulled apart with such positive overhyped reviews I reckon it is A-OK.The burgers are decent, fairly greasy, but tasty! I've never had a chicken buffalo burger before, it was Fan Fucking Tastic!  Crisp outside, smothered in (Franks?) hot sauce, with a nice warmish soft & fresh bun...I wanted it for breakfast the next morning...I want it now....The Dead Hippy was delish too, reminded me of an In n Out burger.....only more expensive. I'd be willing to pay that every now and then for a In in Out fix!The sides were so so, don't think I'd bother with them again (oh except for the coleslaw, that was nice). They were bland and greasy (onion rings & fried pickles - na).The drinks were nice - sticking with the trend of being served in jam jars.Staff were friendly, the place is loud, but not too loud (could still hold a conversation).The thing I just don't get is the queue...we arrived at 5:30pm, no queue, but when we left at around 8pm, faaark!! There were about 100 people queuing! We weren't rushed out, the turnover over of tables was low and slow, I reckon they enjoy having the queue outside - adds to the hype..... that I just don't get......That being said, overall, great burgers, but not amazing enough to merit queuing for hours....	oooh  if i look at this place as somewhere i just wandered into during a shopping trip to refuel i reckon it s pretty good  when i look at it as a restaurant which has been flogged to death and pulled apart with such positive overhyped reviews i reckon it is a ok the burgers are decent  fairly greasy  but tasty  i ve never had a chicken buffalo burger before  it was fan fucking tastic   crisp outside  smothered in  franks   hot sauce  with a nice warmish soft   fresh bun   i wanted it for breakfast the next morning   i want it now    the dead hippy was delish too  reminded me of an in n out burger     only more expensive  i d be willing to pay that every now and then for a in in out fix the sides were so so  don t think i d bother with them again  oh except for the coleslaw  that was nice   they were bland and greasy  onion rings   fried pickles   na  the drinks were nice   sticking with the trend of being served in jam jars staff were friendly  the place is loud  but not too loud  could still hold a conversation  the thing i just don t get is the queue   we arrived at 5 30pm  no queue  but when we left at around 8pm  faaark   there were about 100 people queuing  we weren t rushed out  the turnover over of tables was low and slow  i reckon they enjoy having the queue outside   adds to the hype      that i just don t get      that being said  overall  great burgers  but not amazing enough to merit queuing for hours    
2015	5.0	"BEST BURGER in London hands down so far. I'm sure it partially clogged my arteries after eating it though. I think the top of the bun was brushed in butter! I met my husband here for lunch one weekday and brought my 2 month old infant. She slept right through lunch despite the very loud music playing. The restaurant itself was quite dark for midday, but I'm sure the lighting is great for nighttime. The waitstaff was lovely and accommodating to our HUGE stroller :) The restaurant wasn't very crowded and was a little difficult to find, as the outside entrance is pretty obscure and just says the word ""MEAT"" outside, not ""MEAT LIQUOR"".

2016	4.0	Does exactly what it says on the tin, er, sign. Meat and Liquor. Love the notice on their menu that reads 'No Liquor without Meat'. Thankfully as we visited on a Friday lunchtime we only required the meat, although many other people seemed to be celebrating the arrival of the weekend with both...Having been told how busy it can get I was relieved that when we showed up at 11:45am we only waited a few minutes to be seated. Once inside the service was a little spotty but to be fair they went from being empty to full in five minutes so I suppose that might have been expected.While we waited for our burgers (we skipped the fries as we were feeling virtuous) the decor of this cool space offered plenty to keep us occupied. We spent many minutes admiring the murals, 'blood' spattered walls and ceilings and multiple slogans carefully graffitied across the place. I'll be honest, there was a small part of me which felt a little old to be here...and I have no doubt that on a Friday night when the music's pumping and the liquor is flowing I would feel extremely out of place. That said the burgers were excellent and it was a fun lunchtime stop so it served us well.I had the bacon cheeseburger (to compare it with the Burger & Lobster one I'd had earlier in the week) which was decent and very reasonably priced (especially compared to the Burger & Lobster one!). But my boyfriend had the Green Chili Cheeseburger which was excellent. Just enough spice to make your lips tingle but juicy and tasty.I enjoyed the no plates, kitchen roll instead of napkins and burgers served on a platter thing. They are clearly going low-brow and too cool for cutlery thing which is fitting given the decor. Next time, and I will definitely be going back, I think I'd like to try the cheese fries and maybe a hot dog, and perhaps if I'm feeling young enough a cocktail!	does exactly what it says on the tin  er  sign  meat and liquor  love the notice on their menu that reads  no liquor without meat   thankfully as we visited on a friday lunchtime we only required the meat  although many other people seemed to be celebrating the arrival of the weekend with both   having been told how busy it can get i was relieved that when we showed up at 11 45am we only waited a few minutes to be seated  once inside the service was a little spotty but to be fair they went from being empty to full in five minutes so i suppose that might have been expected while we waited for our burgers  we skipped the fries as we were feeling virtuous  the decor of this cool space offered plenty to keep us occupied  we spent many minutes admiring the murals   blood  spattered walls and ceilings and multiple slogans carefully graffitied across the place  i ll be honest  there was a small part of me which felt a little old to be here   and i have no doubt that on a friday night when the music s pumping and the liquor is flowing i would feel extremely out of place  that said the burgers were excellent and it was a fun lunchtime stop so it served us well i had the bacon cheeseburger  to compare it with the burger   lobster one i d had earlier in the week  which was decent and very reasonably priced  especially compared to the burger   lobster one    but my boyfriend had the green chili cheeseburger which was excellent  just enough spice to make your lips tingle but juicy and tasty i enjoyed the no plates  kitchen roll instead of napkins and burgers served on a platter thing  they are clearly going low brow and too cool for cutlery thing which is fitting given the decor  next time  and i will definitely be going back  i think i d like to try the cheese fries and maybe a hot dog  and perhaps if i m feeling young enough a cocktail

2018	2.0	Gotta say, not that impressed.I've wanted one of these burgers since this place was Meat Wagon. And then #MeatEasy. And now Meat Liquor.After queuing for an hour (and that was a SHORT queue from 6pm on a Tuesday night), I was led inside. The music was loud. The servers were hip. The decor was more East London than it was Marylebone.Our table was in the little downstairs area. The server was WOEFUL. She was entirely too friendly and chatty. If I've waited 15 minutes for you to even acknowledge my existence and take my order, I certainly don't want you to then go to the next table, nattering away and indulging these drunken diners by looking at pictures of god-knows-what on their BlackBerry. I want you to put in my goddamn drink order, at least. I've waited 1 hour and 30 minutes at this point, for fuck's sake. GET ME SOME BOOZE.The cheeseburger was good. I'll give it that.But the deep fried pickles I got as a starter were so unnecessarily greasy that they, in fact, left both me and my dining companion with a stomach ache for the rest of the night. I assume it was the pickles, at least. I certainly hope it wasn't the cheeseburger, since it's kind of Meat Liquor's entire thing - burgers.I'm not sold on the combination of cocktails and burgers, either. It wasn't good. The cocktail was adequate. The burger was excellent. But cocktails do not complement greasy burgers. Stop fooling yourself, people.I'm not sure how or why this place is so popular. I certainly wouldn't wait in that queue for this again, no.	gotta say  not that impressed i ve wanted one of these burgers since this place was meat wagon  and then  meateasy  and now meat liquor after queuing for an hour  and that was a short queue from 6pm on a tuesday night   i was led inside  the music was loud  the servers were hip  the decor was more east london than it was marylebone our table was in the little downstairs area  the server was woeful  she was entirely too friendly and chatty  if i ve waited 15 minutes for you to even acknowledge my existence and take my order  i certainly don t want you to then go to the next table  nattering away and indulging these drunken diners by looking at pictures of god knows what on their blackberry  i want you to put in my goddamn drink order  at least  i ve waited 1 hour and 30 minutes at this point  for fuck s sake  get me some booze the cheeseburger was good  i ll give it that but the deep fried pickles i got as a starter were so unnecessarily greasy that they  in fact  left both me and my dining companion with a stomach ache for the rest of the night  i assume it was the pickles  at least  i certainly hope it wasn t the cheeseburger  since it s kind of meat liquor s entire thing   burgers i m not sold on the combination of cocktails and burgers  either  it wasn t good  the cocktail was adequate  the burger was excellent  but cocktails do not complement greasy burgers  stop fooling yourself  people i m not sure how or why this place is so popular  i certainly wouldn t wait in that queue for this again  no 
2019	5.0	In the midst of my vegetarian experiment, my colleagues decided we'd have a big night out...  at a place called Meat Liquor.  I wasn't very solid in my recent herbivorous conversion and was feeling a bit annoyed with my workmates for choosing this of all places.The queue was massive and to make matters worse, they were pumping the amazing scents of burgers out of the vents to the eager crowds.  We did eventually manage to get through the queue (about 1 hour wait) and they found a table to seat all 7 of us comfortably.The cocktail menu was great.  Some old favourites and not yet discovered classics.  I had both the Silver Angel and the Donkey Punch.  Both fab and about £7 each.The waitress was really slow and not very knowledgeable about the menu.  She was nice enough, but didn't seem to know what she was talking about and couldn't answer questions about sauces or serving sizes.I ordered the halloumi and mushroom sandwich.  It was marked as a veggie option, but I can't deny that it did taste suspicious.  I think the mushrooms and onions were clearly grilled on the same flat top as the beef burgers.  As I mentioned before, I'm not really liking this vegetarian thing so much so it wasn't a major issue for me, but if you're expecting to go there and avoid animal fats in your food, it is probably not a realistic expectation.I honestly cannot say a bad thing about the food.  There was 7 of us at the table, all with our own special requests (no pickles, no sauce, extra onion, ect...) and the order came back perfect.  Magnificent even.  Not a single complaint, and that's very unusual for this group.I love Meat Liquor, and once I'm done with this veggie experiment I'm going to go there and eat a whole plate of buffalo wings and a bacon double cheeseburger with a Meatini.  At least four whole animals will be in that meal, and it'll be amazing.	in the midst of my vegetarian experiment  my colleagues decided we d have a big night out     at a place called meat liquor   i wasn t very solid in my recent herbivorous conversion and was feeling a bit annoyed with my workmates for choosing this of all places the queue was massive and to make matters worse  they were pumping the amazing scents of burgers out of the vents to the eager crowds   we did eventually manage to get through the queue  about 1 hour wait  and they found a table to seat all 7 of us comfortably the cocktail menu was great   some old favourites and not yet discovered classics   i had both the silver angel and the donkey punch   both fab and about  7 each the waitress was really slow and not very knowledgeable about the menu   she was nice enough  but didn t seem to know what she was talking about and couldn t answer questions about sauces or serving sizes i ordered the halloumi and mushroom sandwich   it was marked as a veggie option  but i can t deny that it did taste suspicious   i think the mushrooms and onions were clearly grilled on the same flat top as the beef burgers   as i mentioned before  i m not really liking this vegetarian thing so much so it wasn t a major issue for me  but if you re expecting to go there and avoid animal fats in your food  it is probably not a realistic expectation i honestly cannot say a bad thing about the food   there was 7 of us at the table  all with our own special requests  no pickles  no sauce  extra onion  ect     and the order came back perfect   magnificent even   not a single complaint  and that s very unusual for this group i love meat liquor  and once i m done with this veggie experiment i m going to go there and eat a whole plate of buffalo wings and a bacon double cheeseburger with a meatini   at least four whole animals will be in that meal  and it ll be amazing 
2020	4.0	"On a good day, you can smell it from Oxford Street, a delicious scent curling around the corners of House of Fraser.  If you follow it up Vere St., past the Debenhams window displays, it will get more pronounced, revealing itself for what it is: the smell of pure, delicious beef fat.That smell, that taste, saturates the entire experience at Meat Liquor, from the long queue around the Welbeck St. facade (a full hour when two of us turned up at 7:30pm on a Tuesday), to your dining experience in the sonically and visually loud interior, finally taking the form of a delicious aftertaste as you walk away, your stomach full of meat and fried goods.In our case, after the aforementioned queueing, we were seated on low benches in a dark corner near the piled dirty dishes, rubbish bins, and the kitchen door where someone frequently popped out and yelled ""MEAT!"" as a signal to the waiters that another order was ready.The place is reputed to have good cocktails, but in anticipation of a heavy meal, I stuck with the Mean--er--""Meat""time lager (as the menu puts it).We started with the fried pickles and the chili cheese fries.  The pickles and their accompanying dipping sauce were divine, well worth a try.  On the other hand, I remember the fries as being limp and heavy; not something I'd go for again.We both ordered the Dead Hippie burger, and didn't regret it.  Frankly, the core meat was so good that it probably doesn't matter too much which burger you order.  One of the best I've had in London!BTW, someone has helpfully posted pictures of the menu here:thefoodieat.org/2011/11/…"	on a good day  you can smell it from oxford street  a delicious scent curling around the corners of house of fraser   if you follow it up vere st   past the debenhams window displays  it will get more pronounced  revealing itself for what it is  the smell of pure  delicious beef fat that smell  that taste  saturates the entire experience at meat liquor  from the long queue around the welbeck st  facade  a full hour when two of us turned up at 7 30pm on a tuesday   to your dining experience in the sonically and visually loud interior  finally taking the form of a delicious aftertaste as you walk away  your stomach full of meat and fried goods in our case  after the aforementioned queueing  we were seated on low benches in a dark corner near the piled dirty dishes  rubbish bins  and the kitchen door where someone frequently popped out and yelled  meat   as a signal to the waiters that another order was ready the place is reputed to have good cocktails  but in anticipation of a heavy meal  i stuck with the mean  er   meat time lager  as the menu puts it  we started with the fried pickles and the chili cheese fries   the pickles and their accompanying dipping sauce were divine  well worth a try   on the other hand  i remember the fries as being limp and heavy  not something i d go for again we both ordered the dead hippie burger  and didn t regret it   frankly  the core meat was so good that it probably doesn t matter too much which burger you order   one of the best i ve had in london btw  someone has helpfully posted pictures of the menu here thefoodieat org 2011 11  
2021	3.0	"I'm glad I tried it, but not sure I would be rushing back, especially if the queue was long. I got there around 645pm and we waiting 30-45mins or so which is ok... Once we got in we realised that we had only reached the end of the queue for the bar area! It was then another 15mins or so before we sat down. But there was another girl who arrived at the same time as me.. all her friends were inside and they even saved her a seat and they make her join the back of the queue as well, which I thought was a bit much!In regards to the food, I was probably the least impressed with the burgers out of everything we got... we got the cheesy fries which were really good.. but quite massive. They were like nacho chips with chilli con carne, but with fries instead of corn chips! Spicy wings which was also good - the sauce on the actual wings were good, but the dipping sauce was a bit bland and wasn't blue cheesy enough for my liking. The crack pie for dessert was also yummy, nice and caramelly and a good way to end a massive meal! Think there's also just been so much hype about the burgers that my expectations were really high.. and just didn't quite reach it. I thought the burger meat was a lil dry and just didn't have enough meaty oomphf.. esp the signature dead hippy burger.. the green chilli one was better, both in terms of meat and the sauce. I also thought the place was a bit pretentious - place made to look old but wasn't really, unnecessarily dark for a burger joint, really loud music and ""graffiti"" on the wall but done by designers/ artists rather than something done spontaneously."	i m glad i tried it  but not sure i would be rushing back  especially if the queue was long  i got there around 645pm and we waiting 30 45mins or so which is ok    once we got in we realised that we had only reached the end of the queue for the bar area  it was then another 15mins or so before we sat down  but there was another girl who arrived at the same time as me   all her friends were inside and they even saved her a seat and they make her join the back of the queue as well  which i thought was a bit much in regards to the food  i was probably the least impressed with the burgers out of everything we got    we got the cheesy fries which were really good   but quite massive  they were like nacho chips with chilli con carne  but with fries instead of corn chips  spicy wings which was also good   the sauce on the actual wings were good  but the dipping sauce was a bit bland and wasn t blue cheesy enough for my liking  the crack pie for dessert was also yummy  nice and caramelly and a good way to end a massive meal  think there s also just been so much hype about the burgers that my expectations were really high   and just didn t quite reach it  i thought the burger meat was a lil dry and just didn t have enough meaty oomphf   esp the signature dead hippy burger   the green chilli one was better  both in terms of meat and the sauce  i also thought the place was a bit pretentious   place made to look old but wasn t really  unnecessarily dark for a burger joint  really loud music and  graffiti  on the wall but done by designers  artists rather than something done spontaneously 
2022	2.0	2 Words - Too expensive. I get the whole thing about the greasy burgers in a weird environment. Jam jars for glasses. No plates, use tissues instead. But then that seems to make the place more expensive instead of less. It is a case of having to pay more for less. To add to this, they seem to be making a killing on the beer - a random small can of Belgian Beer (which is the only beer on the menu) costs £4 + which is absurd.I came for an early lunch from work and so I didn't have to endure the queues which everyone else is on about here. The positive, of course, is the food! I  had the dead hippy and it was awesome and the fries are amazing as well. But I wouldn't have come here (and I won't be returning either) if I am the the one paying!	2 words   too expensive  i get the whole thing about the greasy burgers in a weird environment  jam jars for glasses  no plates  use tissues instead  but then that seems to make the place more expensive instead of less  it is a case of having to pay more for less  to add to this  they seem to be making a killing on the beer   a random small can of belgian beer  which is the only beer on the menu  costs  4   which is absurd i came for an early lunch from work and so i didn t have to endure the queues which everyone else is on about here  the positive  of course  is the food  i  had the dead hippy and it was awesome and the fries are amazing as well  but i wouldn t have come here  and i won t be returning either  if i am the the one paying 
2023	4.0	I've come to Meat Liquor for a number of times and it has never disappointed! Last night, I came again with my partner, her sister and her sister's boyfriend. Each of us had a cocktail and we shared the fried pickles and the wings to start. The pickles seemed to be thinner than it was when the place first opened, but they were still very tasty. On our second round of drinks, I asked the waiter if the barman could make me a fruity, rum-based drink (I had Meatjito in my first round and I didn't want the Dry Daquiri from the menu).. and guess what? They made me a really yummy cocktail which the barman didn't have a name for it! I was so happy that they could make something out of the menu (considering that the bar was getting busier at that time..)We ordered 2x dead hippies, a mushroom swiss burger and a halloumi sandwich as our main. We also  chilli cheese fries, cheese fries and onion rings as our side dishes. Food was delicious!We were so full and yet satisfied!	i ve come to meat liquor for a number of times and it has never disappointed  last night  i came again with my partner  her sister and her sister s boyfriend  each of us had a cocktail and we shared the fried pickles and the wings to start  the pickles seemed to be thinner than it was when the place first opened  but they were still very tasty  on our second round of drinks  i asked the waiter if the barman could make me a fruity  rum based drink  i had meatjito in my first round and i didn t want the dry daquiri from the menu    and guess what  they made me a really yummy cocktail which the barman didn t have a name for it  i was so happy that they could make something out of the menu  considering that the bar was getting busier at that time   we ordered 2x dead hippies  a mushroom swiss burger and a halloumi sandwich as our main  we also  chilli cheese fries  cheese fries and onion rings as our side dishes  food was delicious we were so full and yet satisfied 
2024	4.0	Meat liquor is great! But I always leave there feeling beyond greasy and guilty ! The burgers are cooked in butter !! I don't even want to think about the amount of fat in their food. I love the fried pickles , the chilli cheese fries and the burgers of course ! It's sloppy greasy and dirty (in a good way) the inside of the restaurant is dark and alternative like you crawled into a death rocker gothic cave in New Orleans , hard to explain. Cocktails are great too! I would suggest going at odd times of the day as the lines/Q are out the door. Possibly I try around 11pm or other off hours of the day so you don't have to wait , they do not take reservations. If there is a cue I don't wait as there are plenty of other great places to eat in central London. If there is not a long cue I suggest you give it a try !	meat liquor is great  but i always leave there feeling beyond greasy and guilty   the burgers are cooked in butter    i don t even want to think about the amount of fat in their food  i love the fried pickles   the chilli cheese fries and the burgers of course   it s sloppy greasy and dirty  in a good way  the inside of the restaurant is dark and alternative like you crawled into a death rocker gothic cave in new orleans   hard to explain  cocktails are great too  i would suggest going at odd times of the day as the lines q are out the door  possibly i try around 11pm or other off hours of the day so you don t have to wait   they do not take reservations  if there is a cue i don t wait as there are plenty of other great places to eat in central london  if there is not a long cue i suggest you give it a try  
2025	5.0	Dear Meat Liquor,Firstly, and most importantly (and amazingly) thank you for being the only place IN THE WORLD to have created burgers and burgery additions that don't leave me feeling sick and sluggish. I didn't think it was possible! I don't know what the hell you have put in them (or left out of them?) but it's working for me.Secondly thank you for making all your shit taste so damn good... Apart from maybe your chili fries, (sorry) which were WAY too salty (I still ate them all). Thank you for frying pickles. Thank you for serving Mean Time and freezing your beer glasses. You rule. Oh, and thank you for the kitchen roll on the table, so, so necessary.Basically you're the best and I hope we see a lot more of each other in the next few months.Yours (hopefully forever)Daisy B	dear meat liquor firstly  and most importantly  and amazingly  thank you for being the only place in the world to have created burgers and burgery additions that don t leave me feeling sick and sluggish  i didn t think it was possible  i don t know what the hell you have put in them  or left out of them   but it s working for me secondly thank you for making all your shit taste so damn good    apart from maybe your chili fries   sorry  which were way too salty  i still ate them all   thank you for frying pickles  thank you for serving mean time and freezing your beer glasses  you rule  oh  and thank you for the kitchen roll on the table  so  so necessary basically you re the best and i hope we see a lot more of each other in the next few months yours  hopefully forever daisy b
2026	2.0	"You can congratulate Meat Liquor on many things, but the burgers are not one of them.  For the geezer who says that the best burgers in London now have a ""permanent home"", you obviously haven't tried the best burgers yet.From the outside, the front door looks like a building site, with white-washed windows and chicken wire, and on walking in, it looks like a goth metallist's hide out.  Nicely tricked out, and with the hill-billy blues, Cash, and other American classics playing, I get a sense that this could be Trent Reznor's old New Orleans hideout, without the stuffed animal heads and deformed body parts adorning the walls mind you.Being Thursday lunch time, there was no queue, but we had to share a table, and a quick order of bacon cheeseburgers still lead to a 30 minute wait (and they didn't even ask us how we wanted the meat cooked).  As far as burgers go, these guys have hit the American experience on the head.  It reminds me of the US I love, in the same way Pizza East reminds me of the NYC I love.  Greasy, fat-dripping burgers, eaten over a grease-proof paper covered tray, without cutlery and only kitchen roll to catch the spewing juices might not be to everyone's taste, but this is the spirit of the Dirty South.  That being said, the best burger in London this is not, and the amount of sinew I found indigestible in the meat with as much if not more than Byron, though the price is comparable. There are those who would disagree with putting ground Aberdeen Angus steak into a burger, but if you want the best burger in London, then I would seek such things elsewhere, namely at the Rivington.Meat Liquor might be worth the experience, but to schlep from Shoreditch all the way to ""Marylebone"" I would be passing plenty of as good, if not better places on the way.  Certainly go check out the ambiance, and even queue for it, but don't go expecting to have the best burgers in London."	you can congratulate meat liquor on many things  but the burgers are not one of them   for the geezer who says that the best burgers in london now have a  permanent home   you obviously haven t tried the best burgers yet from the outside  the front door looks like a building site  with white washed windows and chicken wire  and on walking in  it looks like a goth metallist s hide out   nicely tricked out  and with the hill billy blues  cash  and other american classics playing  i get a sense that this could be trent reznor s old new orleans hideout  without the stuffed animal heads and deformed body parts adorning the walls mind you being thursday lunch time  there was no queue  but we had to share a table  and a quick order of bacon cheeseburgers still lead to a 30 minute wait  and they didn t even ask us how we wanted the meat cooked    as far as burgers go  these guys have hit the american experience on the head   it reminds me of the us i love  in the same way pizza east reminds me of the nyc i love   greasy  fat dripping burgers  eaten over a grease proof paper covered tray  without cutlery and only kitchen roll to catch the spewing juices might not be to everyone s taste  but this is the spirit of the dirty south   that being said  the best burger in london this is not  and the amount of sinew i found indigestible in the meat with as much if not more than byron  though the price is comparable  there are those who would disagree with putting ground aberdeen angus steak into a burger  but if you want the best burger in london  then i would seek such things elsewhere  namely at the rivington meat liquor might be worth the experience  but to schlep from shoreditch all the way to  marylebone  i would be passing plenty of as good  if not better places on the way   certainly go check out the ambiance  and even queue for it  but don t go expecting to have the best burgers in london

2030	4.0	Meat juices dripping down my chin, a mayyonaise-ketchup combo smeared across my cheek. YES YES YES. The green chile burger was deeelicious. It was cooked the way a burger should be (for me, anyway),medium, and not burned at all. The fries miraculously stayed crispy and warm throughout the whole meal. What?!My only hangup was the staff. They never came by to check up on us (not too surprised, actually) and the guy who brought us our burgers accused us of changing tables because he couldn't find us. WTF?Anyway, aside from jerko I would totally go back. I'm dreaming about that burger.

Once inside the decor is very emo gothic with low lighting and graffiti art on the walls.. my opinion is the light is too low.The menu has a selection of burgers and hot dogs including the infamous American chilli dog!! I opted for this and was happy when it turned up looking exactly how I expected it to. It tasted amazing as did my partners burger with a shared side portion of fries it all made for a very satisfying meal. only disappointment was that they serve on tryst with paper linings rather than plates that can be awkward to eat off.The service was ok, but the waitress seemed a bit pre occupied.	just off the mega busy oxford st  this place can get busy    really busy  get there before 6pm if your not in the mood to que outside  once inside the decor is very emo gothic with low lighting and graffiti art on the walls   my opinion is the light is too low the menu has a selection of burgers and hot dogs including the infamous american chilli dog   i opted for this and was happy when it turned up looking exactly how i expected it to  it tasted amazing as did my partners burger with a shared side portion of fries it all made for a very satisfying meal  only disappointment was that they serve on tryst with paper linings rather than plates that can be awkward to eat off the service was ok  but the waitress seemed a bit pre occupied 
2034	4.0	So I've been meaning to check this place out since it opened a few months back, but didn't have a proper partner in crime to wait out the queue with me. Last week, however came the perfect situation. and OMG yum.yes you have to queue outside for a while (i waited 45 min i think.... ) but it moves pretty quick. but once you're inside! it feels like some kind of punk rock BBQ joint in an old building with strange Italian arches and raised and sunken seating. we quickly ordered Liquor (a twist on a Corpse Reviver and and Donkey Punch i believe), which came quickly, and although a touch too sweet, extremely drinkable. We ordered food at the same time, which thankfully came quickly as i was ready to start chewing off my friends arm.When looking at the menu both of us thought ''The mains look amazing! but the starters seem kind of lack luster.'' Ha. yeah. we were wrong. We asked for everything to be brought out at once and there was so much food. Buffalo Wings with Blue Cheese dip, Chili Cheese Fries, Dead Hippie (think double cheeseburger), and Philly Cheesesteak. and Onion Rings. The way the seasoning on the Wings and the Dip mixed in your mouth was freaking awesome. and the Fries? Hello massive plate of goodness. We're talking best in my life. and I've had me some Chili Cheese fries in my time. The Burger and Cheesesteak? Rather lackluster, actually. The Cheesesteak needed WAY more cheese and the meat itself was far too chunky. its supposed to practically slither down your throat, not gnaw at it for a bit. i wanted dessert, but after basically polishing off the starters (and 1/2 of my main), and 4 cocktails or so, i couldn't fit another bite. well.... actually i could if given a few seconds for breathing. but i had to dash off. So!i will be back.they had a Chili Cheeseburger that has my name off over it, that i must try.	so i ve been meaning to check this place out since it opened a few months back  but didn t have a proper partner in crime to wait out the queue with me  last week  however came the perfect situation  and omg yum yes you have to queue outside for a while  i waited 45 min i think       but it moves pretty quick  but once you re inside  it feels like some kind of punk rock bbq joint in an old building with strange italian arches and raised and sunken seating  we quickly ordered liquor  a twist on a corpse reviver and and donkey punch i believe   which came quickly  and although a touch too sweet  extremely drinkable  we ordered food at the same time  which thankfully came quickly as i was ready to start chewing off my friends arm when looking at the menu both of us thought   the mains look amazing  but the starters seem kind of lack luster    ha  yeah  we were wrong  we asked for everything to be brought out at once and there was so much food  buffalo wings with blue cheese dip  chili cheese fries  dead hippie  think double cheeseburger   and philly cheesesteak  and onion rings  the way the seasoning on the wings and the dip mixed in your mouth was freaking awesome  and the fries  hello massive plate of goodness  we re talking best in my life  and i ve had me some chili cheese fries in my time  the burger and cheesesteak  rather lackluster  actually  the cheesesteak needed way more cheese and the meat itself was far too chunky  its supposed to practically slither down your throat  not gnaw at it for a bit  i wanted dessert  but after basically polishing off the starters  and 1 2 of my main   and 4 cocktails or so  i couldn t fit another bite  well     actually i could if given a few seconds for breathing  but i had to dash off  so i will be back they had a chili cheeseburger that has my name off over it  that i must try 
2035	3.0	Ok so this one of the leaders of London's huge lean towards american diner style eateries; this one with a bit of a nightclub twist. No reservations. So expect to queue. We arrived at 10pm on a Friday night and waited 15 mins outside and then another 15 at the bar inside. The bar wait was fine...the drinks more than made up for it, cocktails were expertly made and quick to boot. Server was young, trendy, polite. He took our orders quickly and attentively. Food came out pretty quick too. Burgers were decent, a la mode at the moment. Brioche, bacon and cheese check! Philly cheese steak wasn't up to much, i've yet to have a good one outside of the States. Fries were good as were the pickles, which I recommend.The venue is loud, dark, busy. If thats your thing then get involved. Best thing...its reasonable. £165 including tip - food and 2 cocktails each. 6 of us ate.  Worth a look, doubt it will last tho.	ok so this one of the leaders of london s huge lean towards american diner style eateries  this one with a bit of a nightclub twist  no reservations  so expect to queue  we arrived at 10pm on a friday night and waited 15 mins outside and then another 15 at the bar inside  the bar wait was fine   the drinks more than made up for it  cocktails were expertly made and quick to boot  server was young  trendy  polite  he took our orders quickly and attentively  food came out pretty quick too  burgers were decent  a la mode at the moment  brioche  bacon and cheese check  philly cheese steak wasn t up to much  i ve yet to have a good one outside of the states  fries were good as were the pickles  which i recommend the venue is loud  dark  busy  if thats your thing then get involved  best thing   its reasonable   165 including tip   food and 2 cocktails each  6 of us ate   worth a look  doubt it will last tho 
2036	5.0	Talk about an overnight success - it wasn't a month after I heard of this place on Thrillst that I was waiting in a 30 minute line on a freezing night to give it a shot.To be fair, the guys who do these burgers do have a good following already - first with meat wagon and the the popup shot in Peckham. And I consider myself lucky that we waited 30 minutes because we walked by the other night thinking if the line was short we would pop in for a drink and the line was at least double from when we stuck it out. Anyway, when we did make it in the first time - it was worth the wait. I had the dirty chicken burger - he had the classic hippie. Deep fried pickles and the lomo to start. He now will order anything with lomo in the name in the hopes it will be as good as that starter. Also, the drinks were top notch. it's just all good - guilt full but good.	talk about an overnight success   it wasn t a month after i heard of this place on thrillst that i was waiting in a 30 minute line on a freezing night to give it a shot to be fair  the guys who do these burgers do have a good following already   first with meat wagon and the the popup shot in peckham  and i consider myself lucky that we waited 30 minutes because we walked by the other night thinking if the line was short we would pop in for a drink and the line was at least double from when we stuck it out  anyway  when we did make it in the first time   it was worth the wait  i had the dirty chicken burger   he had the classic hippie  deep fried pickles and the lomo to start  he now will order anything with lomo in the name in the hopes it will be as good as that starter  also  the drinks were top notch  it s just all good   guilt full but good 
2037	4.0	Meat Liquor opened yesterday. Twitter told me so, albeit cryptically. My interest piqued, I rolled out of Bond Street station in search of the Dead Hippie and some chilli cheese fries and maybe some house booze. Lots of house booze. The quitessential pairing of red meat and liquor. Hence the name.And boy, was it as good as I remember it being at the #meateasy in New Cross. Except now I don't have to go to New Cross, I can just head on over to Marylebone. Of course, the best part was that there was no wait, because apparently only a handful of people follow MeatLiquor's Twitter feed after 5pm. I know this anomaly won't happen again for many months, as mainstream media is reporting it will open for real Friday. But no matter, I don't mind; it's just that good. I will happily go and wait to sit and stuff burgers and chilli cheese fries into my face just about any old day of the week.	meat liquor opened yesterday  twitter told me so  albeit cryptically  my interest piqued  i rolled out of bond street station in search of the dead hippie and some chilli cheese fries and maybe some house booze  lots of house booze  the quitessential pairing of red meat and liquor  hence the name and boy  was it as good as i remember it being at the  meateasy in new cross  except now i don t have to go to new cross  i can just head on over to marylebone  of course  the best part was that there was no wait  because apparently only a handful of people follow meatliquor s twitter feed after 5pm  i know this anomaly won t happen again for many months  as mainstream media is reporting it will open for real friday  but no matter  i don t mind  it s just that good  i will happily go and wait to sit and stuff burgers and chilli cheese fries into my face just about any old day of the week

Terribly friendly staff, good music (perhaps a bit loud) and no children after 6pm ;) Make sure you enjoy a few cocktails at the bar whilst you are waiting, and talk to the bartenders, they're really cool!HOWEVER, go at opening or close to closing time unless queuing for way over an hour is something you take pleasure in.And it's a pity that they no longer make quack pie :/	one of the best burgers in town  terribly friendly staff  good music  perhaps a bit loud  and no children after 6pm    make sure you enjoy a few cocktails at the bar whilst you are waiting  and talk to the bartenders  they re really cool however  go at opening or close to closing time unless queuing for way over an hour is something you take pleasure in and it s a pity that they no longer make quack pie

2041	5.0	Just awesome!  Burgers and fries and everything American diner style.  The burger is one of the best I've had in London - juicy, big, meaty and a little greasy.  The sides were also really good - onion rings, chilli fires, fried pickles (are a must) - with only the mac and cheese missing the mark.  There's nothing fancy but its just good quality food.The atmosphere is a little out there too.  It's dark and loud and punk-ish.  It may not be for everyone but the food will make up for it.  It's also queue only which will make it difficult to get in on weekend nights given how popular its become.	just awesome   burgers and fries and everything american diner style   the burger is one of the best i ve had in london   juicy  big  meaty and a little greasy   the sides were also really good   onion rings  chilli fires  fried pickles  are a must    with only the mac and cheese missing the mark   there s nothing fancy but its just good quality food the atmosphere is a little out there too   it s dark and loud and punk ish   it may not be for everyone but the food will make up for it   it s also queue only which will make it difficult to get in on weekend nights given how popular its become

Reasonably priced as well! But the only issue is the queue. Every time iv been the queue is out the door and the wait is at least an hour.

2044	5.0	I have been here a couple of times as a resident of London, and it is one of my go to places. Depending on the time you go, depends on how long the line is. But the place is always cool, and busy.I've been with the lads for beers, burgers and chicken wings. All great tasty food.I've been with my girlfriend for dog, philly cheese steak and onion rings. Again, these are great.I've been there for the triple chili challenge. Did it in under 10, got it for free, and the food again great.Recommendations are the chilli cheese fries, the chicken burger, onions rings.If you want a cool meal out, that fills you up go here. it's good. real good. I'm also a fan of meatmarket... which has a cut down menu (no wings), and a bit more chilled out atmosphere.	i have been here a couple of times as a resident of london  and it is one of my go to places  depending on the time you go  depends on how long the line is  but the place is always cool  and busy i ve been with the lads for beers  burgers and chicken wings  all great tasty food i ve been with my girlfriend for dog  philly cheese steak and onion rings  again  these are great i ve been there for the triple chili challenge  did it in under 10  got it for free  and the food again great recommendations are the chilli cheese fries  the chicken burger  onions rings if you want a cool meal out  that fills you up go here  it s good  real good  i m also a fan of meatmarket    which has a cut down menu  no wings   and a bit more chilled out atmosphere 
2045	3.0	Visited on a Tuesday evening, no queue outside but had to wait for 10-15mins at the bar for the table. We took bingo wings, chili cheese fries, lamb burger, dead hippie and brown cow. Not the best American food honestly. If there was a queue I would not wait for sure cos it's not worth it. Having said that, the service was fairly good.	visited on a tuesday evening  no queue outside but had to wait for 10 15mins at the bar for the table  we took bingo wings  chili cheese fries  lamb burger  dead hippie and brown cow  not the best american food honestly  if there was a queue i would not wait for sure cos it s not worth it  having said that  the service was fairly good

I liked the decor, the food was reasonably priced, the staff were really friendly, and the guy chiseling ice from a massive block behind the bar was a nice touch. However I was looking for more from the food, which is the main reason I went!Overall it's still worth a visit but if you want great quality burgers then I'd try one of the other places around	pretty cool  but not spectacular it was nice to go to a place in the area that felt a bit different  variety is my friend  i liked the decor  the food was reasonably priced  the staff were really friendly  and the guy chiseling ice from a massive block behind the bar was a nice touch  however i was looking for more from the food  which is the main reason i went overall it s still worth a visit but if you want great quality burgers then i d try one of the other places around
2047	3.0	Lunch at meat liquor.   Had to queue for around 25m as the place takes no bookings.    Service was friendly but a little understaffed.    The management of throughput can be significantly enhanced.     Decor is quite fun.     Food is good but too greasy.    Burgers are great.  Fries standard MacD style.  Big portion of chicken wings.  Coke vanilla floater was so so.  Pricing was good at 65 for 4 people. Overall good place but not quite as good as some of the  new gourmet burger places in NYC and already little overhyped.	lunch at meat liquor    had to queue for around 25m as the place takes no bookings     service was friendly but a little understaffed     the management of throughput can be significantly enhanced      decor is quite fun      food is good but too greasy     burgers are great   fries standard macd style   big portion of chicken wings   coke vanilla floater was so so   pricing was good at 65 for 4 people  overall good place but not quite as good as some of the  new gourmet burger places in nyc and already little overhyped 
2048	3.0	I think that all the big matches going on the day I visited meant the queue was unusually short for 7.30pm on a Saturday night - we were seated within 35 minutes of arriving. Our order was also taken and arrived quite quickly, although given my problems with Hunger Anger I had quite a substantial snack (i.e. a pasta meal for one) a couple of hours beforehand so was not getting stressed at waiting. I did however get pretty irritated with the fact that we sat for over an hour after our meal had been cleared without anyone coming near us to offer more drinks, a dessert menu, or the bill. It was particularly annoying because I tried to flag down several wait staff and I got that strong impression they were deliberately ignoring me. What I actually found most offensive about that is that it's just bad business practice - our bill would have been 50% more if this place was being run properly. And being busy was no excuse, as it was half empty by that time. My friend's theory was the staff are just hired for their look, as it's so sceney. They certainly don't seem to be in it for the tips - when my friend realised their card machine wouldn't let her add a tip and started frantically apologising, the server (one of about 5 involved in our meal) just shrugged!Moving on from my in depth service analysis: The decor is kind of hilarious, the concept is pretty much what you'd expect from a 14 year old rocker's bedroom (skulls, boobs). The stool seats are not comfortable at all, but that wasn't really a big deal. The music is very loud, but it's not terrible music so it's just about bearable. If it were slightly quieter it would make for a great atmosphere.Finally, the important bit: the food. Both burger and fries were very good. I don't like gherkins/pickles but I actually ate some in my green chili burger because the mix of flavours was so well balanced. The juices literally run everywhere, it would be helpful to have a tray/plate each so you don't end up with them all over your table/lap. With better service this would easily have been a four star review. But having read other Yelp reviews with very similar experiences I don't think I'm being too harsh. Approach this SAS style: define your objectives (burger) then get in & get out.	i think that all the big matches going on the day i visited meant the queue was unusually short for 7 30pm on a saturday night   we were seated within 35 minutes of arriving  our order was also taken and arrived quite quickly  although given my problems with hunger anger i had quite a substantial snack  i e  a pasta meal for one  a couple of hours beforehand so was not getting stressed at waiting  i did however get pretty irritated with the fact that we sat for over an hour after our meal had been cleared without anyone coming near us to offer more drinks  a dessert menu  or the bill  it was particularly annoying because i tried to flag down several wait staff and i got that strong impression they were deliberately ignoring me  what i actually found most offensive about that is that it s just bad business practice   our bill would have been 50  more if this place was being run properly  and being busy was no excuse  as it was half empty by that time  my friend s theory was the staff are just hired for their look  as it s so sceney  they certainly don t seem to be in it for the tips   when my friend realised their card machine wouldn t let her add a tip and started frantically apologising  the server  one of about 5 involved in our meal  just shrugged moving on from my in depth service analysis  the decor is kind of hilarious  the concept is pretty much what you d expect from a 14 year old rocker s bedroom  skulls  boobs   the stool seats are not comfortable at all  but that wasn t really a big deal  the music is very loud  but it s not terrible music so it s just about bearable  if it were slightly quieter it would make for a great atmosphere finally  the important bit  the food  both burger and fries were very good  i don t like gherkins pickles but i actually ate some in my green chili burger because the mix of flavours was so well balanced  the juices literally run everywhere  it would be helpful to have a tray plate each so you don t end up with them all over your table lap  with better service this would easily have been a four star review  but having read other yelp reviews with very similar experiences i don t think i m being too harsh  approach this sas style  define your objectives  burger  then get in   get out

You can't look at Twitter without somebody being there or tweeting about it or wishing they were there. I'd had my menu choice recommended to me several times (alas, I could only pick one), I'd been told when to go and what to expect.The food was perfect. The atmosphere great. I loved the decor. What's stopping me giving it 5 stars? I don't know, but it doesn't quite feel like a 5 star rating. I feel bad, but 4 stars it is.

My quest led me to the fantastically decorated MeatLIQUOR in London, and I do feel that my mission has come to an abrupt end!I have never had such an incredible burger, the green chilli left me wanting more and even the chips were too good to leave any. I wish I had found this place sooner as I would never have another burger anywhere else!I could go on about how cool drinking out of jam jars felt, or how awesome the walls were painted, or even how much fun it was too share a giant tray to eat your food off was, but I really think just talking about how amazing my burger was does Meat LIQUOR justice.If you are ever in London then hunt this epic eatery out, and treat yourself to what I would call the best burger I've found! The prices are very reasonable, but be sure to get there early so you don't have to queue.	a burger connoisseur  that s what i d call myself  i eat more burgers that any small female should  and have decided that my mission is to find the best burger out there  my quest led me to the fantastically decorated meatliquor in london  and i do feel that my mission has come to an abrupt end i have never had such an incredible burger  the green chilli left me wanting more and even the chips were too good to leave any  i wish i had found this place sooner as i would never have another burger anywhere else i could go on about how cool drinking out of jam jars felt  or how awesome the walls were painted  or even how much fun it was too share a giant tray to eat your food off was  but i really think just talking about how amazing my burger was does meat liquor justice if you are ever in london then hunt this epic eatery out  and treat yourself to what i would call the best burger i ve found  the prices are very reasonable  but be sure to get there early so you don t have to queue

We turned up at just before 6pm on a Weds, walked straight in, got our choice of table and had a really lovely waitress. When planning ahead, long lines and no space are easily avoidable. And to those complaining, this is one of the most talked about places in town at the moment - were you just expecting to walk straight in?The deep fried gherkins weren't to my taste, but the bacon cheeseburger, fries and onion rings were pretty much perfection. Piping hot, tasty and crunchy. The burger was delicious, and just the right size (for a hungry girl, take note men).The chocolate cream pie was also one of the best desserts I've ever had. No joke.Cocktails were punchy in rice, but really nice (and not shy on the alcohol). Ended up had a Meantime beer afterwards, which went down a treat.Can't wait to go back.	don t listen to the overly critical bad reviews  i had a blast here also  be smart  just don t go at busy times  we turned up at just before 6pm on a weds  walked straight in  got our choice of table and had a really lovely waitress  when planning ahead  long lines and no space are easily avoidable  and to those complaining  this is one of the most talked about places in town at the moment   were you just expecting to walk straight in the deep fried gherkins weren t to my taste  but the bacon cheeseburger  fries and onion rings were pretty much perfection  piping hot  tasty and crunchy  the burger was delicious  and just the right size  for a hungry girl  take note men  the chocolate cream pie was also one of the best desserts i ve ever had  no joke cocktails were punchy in rice  but really nice  and not shy on the alcohol   ended up had a meantime beer afterwards  which went down a treat can t wait to go back

2055	4.0	I went last night with a few friends.Our wings were quite good, and the mac'n'cheese was inedible. The wings were tiny and despite not being overly crispy, we really enjoyed them. The meat was perfectly tender, and the buffalo sauce was light and quite vinegary which really set them apart from most places in London. The mac and cheese was waaaay overcooked (the macaroni were honestly as big as penne due to overboiling).The burgers were all really good -- I had a dead hippie and thought the double thin patties were great (i preferred them to my fiancees single thicker patty), the bun was crispy with a slightly chewy interior, and the pickles and toppings were all very nice.We had one of each side, and everyone loved the deep-fried pickles. They're in an almost tempura batter with a side of blue cheese dipping sauce and the combo of everything was really excellent. As were the onion rings, and the super skinny fries.Our only qualm was the awful service -- our waitress knew nothing about the menu, forgot what we ordered, and was essentially useless, albeit very sweet.Afterward, I didn't feel excellent but that is to be expected after any meal with 4 deep-fried sides and a very very fatty burger. His meat must be a 30% fat because even after cooking to medium oil was dripping down my face.	i went last night with a few friends our wings were quite good  and the mac n cheese was inedible  the wings were tiny and despite not being overly crispy  we really enjoyed them  the meat was perfectly tender  and the buffalo sauce was light and quite vinegary which really set them apart from most places in london  the mac and cheese was waaaay overcooked  the macaroni were honestly as big as penne due to overboiling  the burgers were all really good    i had a dead hippie and thought the double thin patties were great  i preferred them to my fiancees single thicker patty   the bun was crispy with a slightly chewy interior  and the pickles and toppings were all very nice we had one of each side  and everyone loved the deep fried pickles  they re in an almost tempura batter with a side of blue cheese dipping sauce and the combo of everything was really excellent  as were the onion rings  and the super skinny fries our only qualm was the awful service    our waitress knew nothing about the menu  forgot what we ordered  and was essentially useless  albeit very sweet afterward  i didn t feel excellent but that is to be expected after any meal with 4 deep fried sides and a very very fatty burger  his meat must be a 30  fat because even after cooking to medium oil was dripping down my face 
2056	4.0	Things that suck about Meat Liquor: -The décor of this place made me feel like I was having a seizure. It's so try-too-hard I cannot take it.-The queue! We tried to go here a couple of times before actually sitting at a table because I couldn't bring myself to stand outside in an effort to make a place more hip. Just take table reservations. You will not lose cool points. -The weakness of the cocktails. I ordered something that promised to be v. tequila-ey, and it did not do its job. -The chili cheese fries-Eating off of one tray for the whole table. I don't get it. American eating habits can be gross, but plates are pretty standard. I guess it helps them turn tables around quicker without having to worry about dishes? Now, onto happier things: -THE BURGERS. So good. I'm not a huge carnivore by any means, but a good burger when I'm craving it is one of my Americanisms that I can't shake (nor do I want to, for the record). These were excellent burgers. By no means gourmet, but just down and dirty and perfectly prepared. Plus plus plus plus plus. Despite all of the things I wanted to roll my eyes at in this place, the burgers are incredible. -Fried pickles. The only place in London you can get them. I know they sound gross and weird, but trust me, this is some seriously delicious fat-kid food. -The taste of the cocktails. They're really good. Just throw a little more booze in there. I imagine the restaurant is making enough money to afford it. We will definitely be back. The burgers are too good not to, and it's the most affordable burger that ranks. There is also a philly cheesesteak on the menu, which, as native Philadelphians, we will be back to try.	things that suck about meat liquor   the d cor of this place made me feel like i was having a seizure  it s so try too hard i cannot take it  the queue  we tried to go here a couple of times before actually sitting at a table because i couldn t bring myself to stand outside in an effort to make a place more hip  just take table reservations  you will not lose cool points   the weakness of the cocktails  i ordered something that promised to be v  tequila ey  and it did not do its job   the chili cheese fries eating off of one tray for the whole table  i don t get it  american eating habits can be gross  but plates are pretty standard  i guess it helps them turn tables around quicker without having to worry about dishes  now  onto happier things   the burgers  so good  i m not a huge carnivore by any means  but a good burger when i m craving it is one of my americanisms that i can t shake  nor do i want to  for the record   these were excellent burgers  by no means gourmet  but just down and dirty and perfectly prepared  plus plus plus plus plus  despite all of the things i wanted to roll my eyes at in this place  the burgers are incredible   fried pickles  the only place in london you can get them  i know they sound gross and weird  but trust me  this is some seriously delicious fat kid food   the taste of the cocktails  they re really good  just throw a little more booze in there  i imagine the restaurant is making enough money to afford it  we will definitely be back  the burgers are too good not to  and it s the most affordable burger that ranks  there is also a philly cheesesteak on the menu  which  as native philadelphians  we will be back to try 
2057	3.0	This place is dining out on some superb marketing - the food was good-ish, but simply didn't justify the 60 minute queue. Whilst the decor was colourful and the atmosphere great, I was hoping for more interesting food; it was basically just another gourmet burger place, as I experienced it at least. A well deserved shout out should go to the absinthe Long Island iced tea though; that was a nice touch of originality in an otherwise fairly uninteresting experience.	this place is dining out on some superb marketing   the food was good ish  but simply didn t justify the 60 minute queue  whilst the decor was colourful and the atmosphere great  i was hoping for more interesting food  it was basically just another gourmet burger place  as i experienced it at least  a well deserved shout out should go to the absinthe long island iced tea though  that was a nice touch of originality in an otherwise fairly uninteresting experience

There are a bunch of other better burgerish joints around.	place stinks  food very medoicre  but a cool goth rock vibe  i went there once and i don t think it compelled me to go back  there are a bunch of other better burgerish joints around 
2059	3.0	Well meat liquor is the BBQ equivalent of an Abercrombie and Fitch. It's way too dark.  The music is far too loud and the young folk seem to love it. The food is pretty nice but the menu is limited to burgers, which I found irritating as I wanted meat. The lack of vinegar added to my irritation - hence the 3 stars. I prefer Bodeans to this place. Apparently Patty and Bun is good too, but as Bodeans has been a twin birthday venue for some years I'm biased to their way of 'cue.	well meat liquor is the bbq equivalent of an abercrombie and fitch  it s way too dark   the music is far too loud and the young folk seem to love it  the food is pretty nice but the menu is limited to burgers  which i found irritating as i wanted meat  the lack of vinegar added to my irritation   hence the 3 stars  i prefer bodeans to this place  apparently patty and bun is good too  but as bodeans has been a twin birthday venue for some years i m biased to their way of  cue 
2060	4.0	Only a short wait on a monday evening, about 15 minutes and seated almost immediately. Cans of beer are about £4 yes- who cares. you would pay that for a bottle of peroni in a pizza express and its the same damn size!Had deep fried pickles and chicken wings for starters- pickles amazing, wings decent size, little disappointed with the amount of sauce on them but thats personal preference.Chilli cheese burger and bacon cheeseburger for main. very very messy, very VERY delicious! side of onion rings which were huge and so crispy, also fries to top it off.Great vibe in the restaurant, feels really dark dingy and cool.Staff are fine too not sure what people are moaning about.. too many precious people in london.This isnt fine dining but if you want a cool venue, great quality burgers and venue- then you've found it.	only a short wait on a monday evening  about 15 minutes and seated almost immediately  cans of beer are about  4 yes  who cares  you would pay that for a bottle of peroni in a pizza express and its the same damn size had deep fried pickles and chicken wings for starters  pickles amazing  wings decent size  little disappointed with the amount of sauce on them but thats personal preference chilli cheese burger and bacon cheeseburger for main  very very messy  very very delicious  side of onion rings which were huge and so crispy  also fries to top it off great vibe in the restaurant  feels really dark dingy and cool staff are fine too not sure what people are moaning about   too many precious people in london this isnt fine dining but if you want a cool venue  great quality burgers and venue  then you ve found it 
2061	2.0	"The Englishman brought me to MeatLiquor a year ago. We weren't impressed then, and I'm less impressed now. If you sign up on their website, you can get a free drink before April 30th. Seeing this, I thought it would be a nice treat if we went back to MeatLiquor knowing what to fully expect this time. Shout out to Camie T. for her review. It's spot on, although her experience was worse than ours. She has described the experience and the food to a T. Now I understand why somewhere so popular is tempting people to come in for a free drink.First, there is always a 45-60 minute queue to get in. Wouldn't be as bad if the queue wasn't lined with rubbish bins. However, this time they brought out a tray of onion rings and deep fried pickles to munch on while you're waiting (Take heed: I watched a girl DOUBLE DIP in the blue cheese sauce at the beginning of the line and the guy continued serving the dip to the rest of the line. GROSS. Don't try the dip unless you order it yourself. This goes to show, never trust public food.) They do have outdoor heaters to make the wait a bit more enjoyable. Usually, you have to wait an hour outside and at least half an hour in the bar to get a seat. We lucked out last night and were seated immediately after waiting outside, as we were a party of 2. There were still loads of people waiting at the door and the bar.It is way too dark and way too loud. Last year, I thought this was cool. This year, I was sitting directly next to the Englishman at bar style seating, and we had to shout into each other's ear to have a conversation. Thank God we weren't seated in a booth, we'd have to text to communicate. This is all part of the ""I don't give a s**t"" attitude that Meat Liquor projects. This attitude can only work to certain degree before customers start getting fed up with being treated like nothing. It even says so on the menu (something to the effect of you can have what you want on your burger, followed by ""I don't care.""), followed by a line at the bottom saying don't be embarrassed to ask for your order to be fixed. Sounds like maybe they might actually care a little, eh? Nope. See below.This is where we start to have issues. Upon being seated, the Englishman went to the bar to use our vouchers. 15 minutes later he comes back empty handed, as you must order the drink from a set menu that the server has. Okay, that was fine - a bit frustrating, but fine. We didn't expect much for free. During that time, I saved our table and spent the entire time trying to figure out who our server was. None of the servers made eye contact with customers. No one came over. Nothing. Finally, thirty minutes after being seated, we managed to call our server over (well, we think she was our server... it's not like she introduced herself or anything). After explaining we had the voucher, she asked what drink we would like. We ordered and we told blankly that we could only have a Donkey Punch. Sorry, what was the point of asking us what drink we wanted if we could only have the one? My second issue, is that the Donkey Punch is a drink priced at £7.50. There are other drinks priced for £7.50 that we asked if we could switch for something of the same price, only to be told in a ""I don't give a s**t"" attitude, ""No."" That's fine, we tried something new and drank the Donkey Punch and then ordered the drinks we were hoping for. That attitude remained for the rest of the interactions (few and far between as they were with our server). Rude.We ordered a chilli cheeseburger, the mushroom swiss burger and chicken wings, a Zombie and a Game Over to share. It came to about £20 for each of us. My issue with Meat Liquor is not the food. I really enjoyed the chilli cheeseburger and the Englishman said he really enjoyed his meal. However, our issue lies with the service. Our server never came over at any point after ordering. She wasn't around. She never checked in with us. We had to get her attention every time. When we got the bill, it included an expected service change. We were offended that we were expected to pay this after being neglected for the entire time we were there. I realize that they made this mandatory, as the attitude of the servers means if tipping was optional, they wouldn't get anything. While we were debating this charge, our server came over twice within a few minutes to get the payment. She wasn't around the whole time, yet she was like a hawk when it came to taking our money. We asked our server if it was mandatory to pay this and she was genuinely offended that we didn't want to pay it. She asked why and when we gave the first reason (of many more to follow) she seemed genuinely disinterested and non-apologetic, took our money and left without a word. Usually, in other restaurants when all the servers seem to be genuinely disinterested, the cause usually lies with poor management.

2062	3.0	Went on Monday lunch no queue - Why so dark??? Hippie fries had way too many onions and not enough sauce  - Burger was amazing though - nowhere near worth the wait that I'm reading about on other reviews here, I would maybe go back at a quiet time but not worth any kind of wait...	went on monday lunch no queue   why so dark    hippie fries had way too many onions and not enough sauce    burger was amazing though   nowhere near worth the wait that i m reading about on other reviews here  i would maybe go back at a quiet time but not worth any kind of wait   
2063	4.0	So, I'd been wanting to go here for a few months after hearing rave reviews and the hype surrounding the place and its humble street-food beginnings. There was a queue when we arrived (Saturday night) though it was moving surprisingly fast. I could imagine it would get to be pretty annoying were it for any longer than we waited (about 40 mins). They have a quite strict queueing system, which means you cannot hold places for people in your group, which is actually something of a good idea but goes to show this places' popularity. Once inside, you're greeted with a wall of sound, both from the blazing speakers pumping out 50's rock'n'roll and from the bar and tables of the punters themselves. This is definitely not a place to come to quietly pass the time with a burger and fries. This is party-time! And a very well organised party at that. The atmosphere is, for want of a better word, hedonistic, in that you feel as though you've stumbled into some little-known underground speakeasy where the clientel are making the most of its secrecy. The thing of course is that everyone now knows of this place, so I'm impressed at how they've managed to keep the vibe goingThey also have the novel addition of a photo booth which takes surprisingly good quality pictures, definitely a big bonus for any group night out. We were seated within about 15 minutes of arriving and had the change to get in some photo booth time, a pint of 'house grog' (excellent) and a shot at the bar. The menu is nice and simple, a few variations on the burger, 2 hot dogs, fried, onion rings etc Nothing looked overly expensive and I suspect that they offset keeping the food reasonable by charging well for the booze. We ordered a burger each (4 of us), a Chilli Dog, Chilli & Cheese fries and Onion Rings to share. Definitely plenty of food and a good rounded selection from the menu.Burgers are king and all were cooked excellently medium rare (no option given when ordered). The Chilli Dog was ok but not outstanding. Chilli * Cheese fries, however, were my standout of the night. Lovely melted Jack cheese top and a VERY good (and seemingly house made) chilli, which was so moreish and memorable I wanted it the next morning for breakfast. The 4 of us spent a total of £140. At £35 a piece I thought it quite good as we weren't bothered about the bill going in.All in all a really fun, filling and thoroughly enjoyable night out. Highly recommend going at least once to this one of a kind pig-out palace!	so  i d been wanting to go here for a few months after hearing rave reviews and the hype surrounding the place and its humble street food beginnings  there was a queue when we arrived  saturday night  though it was moving surprisingly fast  i could imagine it would get to be pretty annoying were it for any longer than we waited  about 40 mins   they have a quite strict queueing system  which means you cannot hold places for people in your group  which is actually something of a good idea but goes to show this places  popularity  once inside  you re greeted with a wall of sound  both from the blazing speakers pumping out 50 s rock n roll and from the bar and tables of the punters themselves  this is definitely not a place to come to quietly pass the time with a burger and fries  this is party time  and a very well organised party at that  the atmosphere is  for want of a better word  hedonistic  in that you feel as though you ve stumbled into some little known underground speakeasy where the clientel are making the most of its secrecy  the thing of course is that everyone now knows of this place  so i m impressed at how they ve managed to keep the vibe goingthey also have the novel addition of a photo booth which takes surprisingly good quality pictures  definitely a big bonus for any group night out  we were seated within about 15 minutes of arriving and had the change to get in some photo booth time  a pint of  house grog   excellent  and a shot at the bar  the menu is nice and simple  a few variations on the burger  2 hot dogs  fried  onion rings etc nothing looked overly expensive and i suspect that they offset keeping the food reasonable by charging well for the booze  we ordered a burger each  4 of us   a chilli dog  chilli   cheese fries and onion rings to share  definitely plenty of food and a good rounded selection from the menu burgers are king and all were cooked excellently medium rare  no option given when ordered   the chilli dog was ok but not outstanding  chilli   cheese fries  however  were my standout of the night  lovely melted jack cheese top and a very good  and seemingly house made  chilli  which was so moreish and memorable i wanted it the next morning for breakfast  the 4 of us spent a total of  140  at  35 a piece i thought it quite good as we weren t bothered about the bill going in all in all a really fun  filling and thoroughly enjoyable night out  highly recommend going at least once to this one of a kind pig out palace 
2064	3.0	The ambience through great music and awesome decorations is a cool complement to an interesting way to serve big burgers - without plates- and great cocktails. Although the food was not that special - having had the Dead Hippie Burger which was a regular version of a rawed burger - the cocktails were pretty nice - having had the dry daiquiri and the Louisiana jam.	the ambience through great music and awesome decorations is a cool complement to an interesting way to serve big burgers   without plates  and great cocktails  although the food was not that special   having had the dead hippie burger which was a regular version of a rawed burger   the cocktails were pretty nice   having had the dry daiquiri and the louisiana jam 
2065	2.0	"The dead hippie - not bad, basically a homage to an in and out animal style burger. It's a solid a burger for London, but a bit on the greasy side. The buffalo chicken burger was super spicy, a fried chicken filet drowning in spicy buffalo sauce. I really wasn't expecting it but this chicken burger definitely had a kick.  Don't know if I would get it again though... reminded me of a very spicy, but not as tasty chik filet sandwich. The chili cheese fries were meh. Their chili to fry ratio was totally off - it was practically 2/3 chili (not very good chili, more like dried ground beef and chili powder), 1/3 fries, and waaaayyyyy too many jalepenos. It tasted too tangy, not the typical chili cheese fries plate you'd find back home in the states. The drinks were actually decent! If I come back I'm just getting a burger, the donkey punch (like a moscow mule) and that grog punch thingie (awesome punch with light and dark rum).  The bartender was actually very helpful and explained some of the drinks, we tipped him as if we were back in NYC.The waiter on the other hand - not so much. He didn't care to take our order, give us any utensils, or bring us a bill.  It all seemed very much for him. Lastly, I don't get the long queue outside. It seemed a bit like they actually wanted to keep a queue for appearances and such.  After waiting for about 45 minutes and being at the front of the queue, I saw 4 or 5 empty tables.  On top of that, they were ushering people from the line to the bar first, making you order drinks and waiting there for an additional 20 minutes, and then seating you.  It all seemed very counter-productive and aimed at two goals: 1. keeping a line outside for hype; and 2. ""encouraging"" patrons to buy a few drinks after being frustrated with the long wait outside. Will I return? Maybe... sans the pre-meditated queue and the waiter who doesn't want to wait tables."	the dead hippie   not bad  basically a homage to an in and out animal style burger  it s a solid a burger for london  but a bit on the greasy side  the buffalo chicken burger was super spicy  a fried chicken filet drowning in spicy buffalo sauce  i really wasn t expecting it but this chicken burger definitely had a kick   don t know if i would get it again though    reminded me of a very spicy  but not as tasty chik filet sandwich  the chili cheese fries were meh  their chili to fry ratio was totally off   it was practically 2 3 chili  not very good chili  more like dried ground beef and chili powder   1 3 fries  and waaaayyyyy too many jalepenos  it tasted too tangy  not the typical chili cheese fries plate you d find back home in the states  the drinks were actually decent  if i come back i m just getting a burger  the donkey punch  like a moscow mule  and that grog punch thingie  awesome punch with light and dark rum    the bartender was actually very helpful and explained some of the drinks  we tipped him as if we were back in nyc the waiter on the other hand   not so much  he didn t care to take our order  give us any utensils  or bring us a bill   it all seemed very much for him  lastly  i don t get the long queue outside  it seemed a bit like they actually wanted to keep a queue for appearances and such   after waiting for about 45 minutes and being at the front of the queue  i saw 4 or 5 empty tables   on top of that  they were ushering people from the line to the bar first  making you order drinks and waiting there for an additional 20 minutes  and then seating you   it all seemed very counter productive and aimed at two goals  1  keeping a line outside for hype  and 2   encouraging  patrons to buy a few drinks after being frustrated with the long wait outside  will i return  maybe    sans the pre meditated queue and the waiter who doesn t want to wait tables 
2066	3.0	Went here on a work Night out just after Christmas. Thought the service was passable and was a bit miffed when the lady tending to the queue would not accept my provisional licence as proof of age...! She then proceed to tell me they only accept Passports wtf! I got in just because everyone else around me has 'suitable' ID on them.I had the Dead Hippie burger and enjoyed every little bit of it! Slightly in the greasy drip side but I guess that's the nature of the food. I didn't like how the whole tables' meal comes on one tray, authentic or not I think it's a tad cheap. Expecting the plates to come next, which they didn't, which I thought was cool with although they could have stocked up on the kitchen paper. Another thing that bugged me is how badly lit the place was. I couldn't tell whether my burger was cooked how I like it or not. A lot of people had been raving on about their Chilli Cheese Fries, I thought they put a little too much mustard on and the fries went soggy after a few minutes. The Onion Rings were amazing (I did order Fried Pickles also, however the waitress never heard me). I washed it all down with a Coke Float which I absolutely adored! We did attempt to order some Crack Pie but they'd run out...!I will visit this place again, hopefully after the hype has died. I think some of the staff are a little hyped up on how 'cool' their place of work is, they could possibly concentrate on better service. All in all it's nice to see a decent burger joint in Central London.	went here on a work night out just after christmas  thought the service was passable and was a bit miffed when the lady tending to the queue would not accept my provisional licence as proof of age     she then proceed to tell me they only accept passports wtf  i got in just because everyone else around me has  suitable  id on them i had the dead hippie burger and enjoyed every little bit of it  slightly in the greasy drip side but i guess that s the nature of the food  i didn t like how the whole tables  meal comes on one tray  authentic or not i think it s a tad cheap  expecting the plates to come next  which they didn t  which i thought was cool with although they could have stocked up on the kitchen paper  another thing that bugged me is how badly lit the place was  i couldn t tell whether my burger was cooked how i like it or not  a lot of people had been raving on about their chilli cheese fries  i thought they put a little too much mustard on and the fries went soggy after a few minutes  the onion rings were amazing  i did order fried pickles also  however the waitress never heard me   i washed it all down with a coke float which i absolutely adored  we did attempt to order some crack pie but they d run out    i will visit this place again  hopefully after the hype has died  i think some of the staff are a little hyped up on how  cool  their place of work is  they could possibly concentrate on better service  all in all it s nice to see a decent burger joint in central london 
2067	2.0	This place has a cool grunge vibe and serves some fine beers but we didn't think the burgers were very good. My beef with red chilli burger was fairly bland, and my wife's chicken burger was just weird and a bit too strong. The chips were so so too. Saying that the Greek salad was exceptional! Strange. I'll stick to Patty and Bun, Honest burgers etc	this place has a cool grunge vibe and serves some fine beers but we didn t think the burgers were very good  my beef with red chilli burger was fairly bland  and my wife s chicken burger was just weird and a bit too strong  the chips were so so too  saying that the greek salad was exceptional  strange  i ll stick to patty and bun  honest burgers etc
2068	4.0	This is one of those places that is really all about the food. Yes, you might have to queue for hours, yes, once you're seated you will have to wait up to 45 minutes for your food to arrive, and yes, you will be eating off of a cafeteria tray and given a kitchen roll as napkins. But none of that matters, because Meat Liquor is all about the food- the amazing, juicy (but very greasy) burgers, cheesesteaks, chili cheese fries....it's definitely a place worth trying.To avoid queues come before 1pm or after 4pm for lunch.	this is one of those places that is really all about the food  yes  you might have to queue for hours  yes  once you re seated you will have to wait up to 45 minutes for your food to arrive  and yes  you will be eating off of a cafeteria tray and given a kitchen roll as napkins  but none of that matters  because meat liquor is all about the food  the amazing  juicy  but very greasy  burgers  cheesesteaks  chili cheese fries    it s definitely a place worth trying to avoid queues come before 1pm or after 4pm for lunch

2071	5.0	No Children after 6pm was the sign that greeted us. LOL, love it! The four of us immediately thought, wow what kind of place are we about to enter for lunch. I'd heard about this place and it was a burger must try. Once there I event messaged a fellow yelper, Kevin after reading his review which I found helpful. Thanks Kevin. So our lunch experience began, at the bar. Bloody Mary showed up and that girl was SPICY (almost regretfully so!) but we survived. The bartender said 'ok look, we're known for our Chili Cheese Fries and Onion Rings so you've got to try them' and we did. Ok, good and interesting as far as CCF go. I consider myself a connoisseur in the chili cheese fries department however I've never had them with mustard loaded on them. Not bad, probably not the best but it didn't stop all of us from devouring the entire serving. The onion rings were fantastic and my choice of the Mushroom and Swiss burger was good and MESSY. There's a reason all tables have a roll of paper towels on them. Sometimes the messier the better I say. At the end of lunch we sat and took in the interesting space and began to wonder why and just what happens after 6pm. Clearly I'll be returning to find out for myself just not alone. :)Inside you'll find red lighting accents among the dark spaces with a huge dome roof displaying graffiti style artwork. I'm sure the inspiration for the interior could be describe as punk rock and kick-ass with an edgy bar feel. So, be forewarned if you're not into communal eating and easily offended by graphic imagery and words on the wall this is not the place for you.The service was fair given the place was packed and perhaps I was a bit impatient for my Diet Coke to extinguish the fire set by the Bloody Mary. I believe this to be one of my best if not the best burger experience in London. Meat Liquor satisfied our cravings for a kick-ass burger in London and I can't wait to go again y'all, especially after 6pm.	no children after 6pm was the sign that greeted us  lol  love it  the four of us immediately thought  wow what kind of place are we about to enter for lunch  i d heard about this place and it was a burger must try  once there i event messaged a fellow yelper  kevin after reading his review which i found helpful  thanks kevin  so our lunch experience began  at the bar  bloody mary showed up and that girl was spicy  almost regretfully so   but we survived  the bartender said  ok look  we re known for our chili cheese fries and onion rings so you ve got to try them  and we did  ok  good and interesting as far as ccf go  i consider myself a connoisseur in the chili cheese fries department however i ve never had them with mustard loaded on them  not bad  probably not the best but it didn t stop all of us from devouring the entire serving  the onion rings were fantastic and my choice of the mushroom and swiss burger was good and messy  there s a reason all tables have a roll of paper towels on them  sometimes the messier the better i say  at the end of lunch we sat and took in the interesting space and began to wonder why and just what happens after 6pm  clearly i ll be returning to find out for myself just not alone    inside you ll find red lighting accents among the dark spaces with a huge dome roof displaying graffiti style artwork  i m sure the inspiration for the interior could be describe as punk rock and kick ass with an edgy bar feel  so  be forewarned if you re not into communal eating and easily offended by graphic imagery and words on the wall this is not the place for you the service was fair given the place was packed and perhaps i was a bit impatient for my diet coke to extinguish the fire set by the bloody mary  i believe this to be one of my best if not the best burger experience in london  meat liquor satisfied our cravings for a kick ass burger in london and i can t wait to go again y all  especially after 6pm 
2072	4.0	In London on business and thought I would check out one of the hot spots for burgers.  For those that have been to Kuma's in Chicago, this place is Kuma's on steriods.  There was a que to get in - about 30 minutes which went by quickly.  Once through the que, I was sat quickly.  Service was very pleasurable.  The burgers were very good - juicy, well seasoned and plentiful toppings.  The cheese fries were good, not great - a bit salty.  The fried pickles were fantastic.  Definitely a hip, cool place but hard to talk with the music so loud.  A London experience I would go back to.	in london on business and thought i would check out one of the hot spots for burgers   for those that have been to kuma s in chicago  this place is kuma s on steriods   there was a que to get in   about 30 minutes which went by quickly   once through the que  i was sat quickly   service was very pleasurable   the burgers were very good   juicy  well seasoned and plentiful toppings   the cheese fries were good  not great   a bit salty   the fried pickles were fantastic   definitely a hip  cool place but hard to talk with the music so loud   a london experience i would go back to 
2073	3.0	The new resting place of the Meat Wagon, success has gained them a flashy, central London location. I arrived at 7 and queued for an hour, I balanced this with the fact I used to travel all the way to New Cross and Peckham.We sat in a lower level and had to overcome the fumes of newly varnished tables. Service was erratic, much faster if you are proactive and get your own menus.The burgers are still great, but not amazing. Not sure if its atmosphere, they just do not taste as good as the very first time I tried them. Cocktail list is well priced and executed.Will probably return, but only if I know I can avoid the busier times. They currently are doing 90 covers but hope to increase it to 140. Wonder how that is going to work as it was hard to find seats as it is.	the new resting place of the meat wagon  success has gained them a flashy  central london location  i arrived at 7 and queued for an hour  i balanced this with the fact i used to travel all the way to new cross and peckham we sat in a lower level and had to overcome the fumes of newly varnished tables  service was erratic  much faster if you are proactive and get your own menus the burgers are still great  but not amazing  not sure if its atmosphere  they just do not taste as good as the very first time i tried them  cocktail list is well priced and executed will probably return  but only if i know i can avoid the busier times  they currently are doing 90 covers but hope to increase it to 140  wonder how that is going to work as it was hard to find seats as it is

2076	3.0	Bizarrely like being in an episode of True Blood  the decor is deliberately trashed, waitresses wear the likes of Ramones T-shirts and leopard print head bands. Not sure if the menus were deliberately stickyThe fact is, if this restaurant was plonked in the middle of Leicester Square, most people wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. But there's something about itthe hype, the no-nonsense attitude, the burgersthat gives it some kind of pull.No plates, no cutlery, kitchen roll on the tables and drinks served in jam jars: it's all very cool, I'm just not sure if, hype aside, it's that much more spectacular than a regular burger joint.	bizarrely like being in an episode of true blood  the decor is deliberately trashed  waitresses wear the likes of ramones t shirts and leopard print head bands  not sure if the menus were deliberately stickythe fact is  if this restaurant was plonked in the middle of leicester square  most people wouldn t touch it with a barge pole  but there s something about itthe hype  the no nonsense attitude  the burgersthat gives it some kind of pull no plates  no cutlery  kitchen roll on the tables and drinks served in jam jars  it s all very cool  i m just not sure if  hype aside  it s that much more spectacular than a regular burger joint

2078	4.0	My first review! So the much hyped MEATLiquor - although I generally tend to stay away from hype I will admit that my experience wasn't too shabby at all. Yes there was a queue even at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, but the wait wasn't bad and a smiley waiter brought a big tray of onion rings and fried pickles out to the waiting masses which was very sweet! We were shown straight to the bar once we reached the front of the queue and tried a very well prepared cocktail (reasonably priced) before finally getting a table. We ordered wings (crispy and very well seasoned - not the drippy kind of buffalo wings you normally find), bacon cheeseburger (nice big patty - but I thought it was a bit dry and the bread a little stale), Philly cheesesteaks (great amount of meat and well seasoned) and coleslaw and fries. We enjoyed the grungy but slightly loud atmosphere but not the waiting to grab a waitress to pay and leave. Overall though it's somewhere I'd def like to go back. I've yet to find better wings in London!	my first review  so the much hyped meatliquor   although i generally tend to stay away from hype i will admit that my experience wasn t too shabby at all  yes there was a queue even at 7 30 on a tuesday night  but the wait wasn t bad and a smiley waiter brought a big tray of onion rings and fried pickles out to the waiting masses which was very sweet  we were shown straight to the bar once we reached the front of the queue and tried a very well prepared cocktail  reasonably priced  before finally getting a table  we ordered wings  crispy and very well seasoned   not the drippy kind of buffalo wings you normally find   bacon cheeseburger  nice big patty   but i thought it was a bit dry and the bread a little stale   philly cheesesteaks  great amount of meat and well seasoned  and coleslaw and fries  we enjoyed the grungy but slightly loud atmosphere but not the waiting to grab a waitress to pay and leave  overall though it s somewhere i d def like to go back  i ve yet to find better wings in london 
2079	4.0	2 hour queue? No way! So my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out during off hours and I'm glad we did.The interior is dark and reminiscent of a theme park haunted house. I was put off by it initially but realized it was only fitting once I was served my Dead Hippie. The grease from the burgers and fries were undoubtedly dripping all over my hands, which at that point, blindness was bliss. If you're not into fatty, greasy and perfectly medium-rare burgers, stay away. This is, however, a carnivore's paradise.	2 hour queue  no way  so my boyfriend and i decided to check this place out during off hours and i m glad we did the interior is dark and reminiscent of a theme park haunted house  i was put off by it initially but realized it was only fitting once i was served my dead hippie  the grease from the burgers and fries were undoubtedly dripping all over my hands  which at that point  blindness was bliss  if you re not into fatty  greasy and perfectly medium rare burgers  stay away  this is  however  a carnivore s paradise 
2080	2.0	"Funny name, but:1. We had to queue outside in the cold for 30 minutes. I'm going to eat a so-so burger, not dance in the club. Jesus, they  might as well have had bouncers.2. Extremely crowded and loud (on Saturday night). Not that I'm surprised by that, but if you want a relaxing dinner out then this is not the place. It's a huge hipster joint.3. Waitress (when she was able to come since the place was massively understaffed) was nice and took our order. However, we were not given plates to eat off of but instead the three of us had to eat off of one trey while sitting at a bar table, so lots of inconvenient passing and reaching over each other was required.4. This was what really sent me over the edge: I was thirsty after their ridiculously greasy and salty burger, so I asked a waiter if I could have some water. He honestly looked me in the eye, frowned at me as if to say ""seriously?"" and then walked right over to the bar (about 2m away from us) and got HIS OWN glass of water to drink right in front of me!The fried pickles were really good, but the fries were mediocre at best, as was the burger. The meat is of average quality and they don't have anything creative to offer on the menu (if you're only going to make bacon & cheese, cheese, and swiss & mushroom burgers then you'd better do them a hell of a lot better than Meat Liquor does them). I mean, their whole business is based on branding by wrapping themselves up in a ""cool"" package (and not on the quality of service and food), so why not add some burgers that have ""alternative"" ingredients for customers to enjoy yet another layer of unnecessary glitz?I'm sorry but playing loud music, adorning your walls with alternative ""art"" and saddling customers with some pathetic no-nonsense schtick (making them wait outside because reservations are forbidden, not bringing them plates or water, making them wait FOREVER to get a waiter's attention or food for that matter) is way below my standard. I guess people like this place because it seems so exclusive, new, and hip but the fad will eventually wear off.

2084	5.0	MAN VS FOOD LONDON STYLEGoing to keep this short because this place is just well and truly one of the best eats in London. Admittedly i queued for an hour to get thought the door (be patient, it's worth every second) but the food was sensational and although the restaurant was filled to the brim, service was fast and efficient. Me and my friend shared a cheeseburger, chilli cheese fries, buffalo wings and a chill dog, WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. Even though they were the best chicken wings i've ever had i couldn't fit one more in. So my advice: order sensibly and not with your stomach. I actually ate so much Man vs Food style i was sick. Just emphasising that i couldn't stop eating their delish food. Oh and the cocktails are fabulous and reasonably priced for London. I suggest the Meatjito and Henrietta Fizz (i had about four)I enjoyed myself too much here and can't wait to not eat for a week so i can go and pig out again. LOVE it.	man vs food london stylegoing to keep this short because this place is just well and truly one of the best eats in london  admittedly i queued for an hour to get thought the door  be patient  it s worth every second  but the food was sensational and although the restaurant was filled to the brim  service was fast and efficient  me and my friend shared a cheeseburger  chilli cheese fries  buffalo wings and a chill dog  way too much food  even though they were the best chicken wings i ve ever had i couldn t fit one more in  so my advice  order sensibly and not with your stomach  i actually ate so much man vs food style i was sick  just emphasising that i couldn t stop eating their delish food  oh and the cocktails are fabulous and reasonably priced for london  i suggest the meatjito and henrietta fizz  i had about four i enjoyed myself too much here and can t wait to not eat for a week so i can go and pig out again  love it 
2085	4.0	We happened to be in the area and decided to give Meat Liquor another try. This was our second visit and again we didn't have much trouble getting a table, although on both occasions, we were here on a Thursday and before 6.30pm. There were 4 of us so we shared the buffalo wings and slaw....both were good especially the slaw.  The burgers were definitely more up to par this time around. Service was slightly better (we had a new waiter who seemed very eager to please). As expected, there was a huge queue outside when we left, but no one seemed to be in a rush to get people seated asap even though there were always quite a few empty seats available.	we happened to be in the area and decided to give meat liquor another try  this was our second visit and again we didn t have much trouble getting a table  although on both occasions  we were here on a thursday and before 6 30pm  there were 4 of us so we shared the buffalo wings and slaw    both were good especially the slaw   the burgers were definitely more up to par this time around  service was slightly better  we had a new waiter who seemed very eager to please   as expected  there was a huge queue outside when we left  but no one seemed to be in a rush to get people seated asap even though there were always quite a few empty seats available

2088	4.0	"Isn't this the best possible name for a restaurant ? I think it is. So ever since i read on Yelp about its opening, it has been consistently on the top of my list of new places to try out. But one thing led to another, and i didn't have a chance until last Saturday when i finally made a firm plan.My friend dropped out at the last minute, but i still went on alone.Meat liquor is known for its long waits. Its a place where you cannot book a table and your friends cannot preserve a place for you in the queue. But i had gambled that Saturday lunch time wouldn't be the busiest slot in the week for them ... and i was right. I was alone and i found a table straight-away. However even larger groups had to wait for only a short while. The restaurant was busy, but only moderately so.I was taken aback when i stepped into the dining area. It was dark, with reasonably poor visibility, and lit only by red lights. Did I enter a gentlemen's club by mistake ? No ... the people were busy eating food, so I must have been at the correct place. The food menu was small, only about a page long, and consists primarily of a variety of burgers. I went for a standard bacon and cheeseburger. At around £7,  it's considerably cheaper than the £20 burgers at B & L. It was big enough to be filling, and it was tasty. But I didn't enjoy the piece of pickle inside ... I would have preferred my burger without it. The burger went very well with mustard sauce. The fries (not chips) were fabulous and the portion size was pretty large. For liquor, I went for the ""grog"". It was basically a very strong rum punch, made with a variety of added juices and syrups. The taste of mango dominated. The cocktail was great but I didn't think it was strong enough to deserve the 2 per person limit. The cocktail menu otherwise was quite conventional, with only the usual alternatives. At £9, the cocktails were priced appropriately for the location of the restaurant. So all in all i had a simple and satisfying lunch for less than £20. Although Meat Liquor did not impress me enough to want to brave the legendary queues, I would happily return for mid day meals on Saturdays."	isn t this the best possible name for a restaurant   i think it is  so ever since i read on yelp about its opening  it has been consistently on the top of my list of new places to try out  but one thing led to another  and i didn t have a chance until last saturday when i finally made a firm plan my friend dropped out at the last minute  but i still went on alone meat liquor is known for its long waits  its a place where you cannot book a table and your friends cannot preserve a place for you in the queue  but i had gambled that saturday lunch time wouldn t be the busiest slot in the week for them     and i was right  i was alone and i found a table straight away  however even larger groups had to wait for only a short while  the restaurant was busy  but only moderately so i was taken aback when i stepped into the dining area  it was dark  with reasonably poor visibility  and lit only by red lights  did i enter a gentlemen s club by mistake   no     the people were busy eating food  so i must have been at the correct place  the food menu was small  only about a page long  and consists primarily of a variety of burgers  i went for a standard bacon and cheeseburger  at around  7   it s considerably cheaper than the  20 burgers at b   l  it was big enough to be filling  and it was tasty  but i didn t enjoy the piece of pickle inside     i would have preferred my burger without it  the burger went very well with mustard sauce  the fries  not chips  were fabulous and the portion size was pretty large  for liquor  i went for the  grog   it was basically a very strong rum punch  made with a variety of added juices and syrups  the taste of mango dominated  the cocktail was great but i didn t think it was strong enough to deserve the 2 per person limit  the cocktail menu otherwise was quite conventional  with only the usual alternatives  at  9  the cocktails were priced appropriately for the location of the restaurant  so all in all i had a simple and satisfying lunch for less than  20  although meat liquor did not impress me enough to want to brave the legendary queues  i would happily return for mid day meals on saturdays

2090	2.0	Like other reviewers, this used to be my favourite. I've been supporting this eatery since the days of #MEATeasy, and was thrilled when a permanent restaurant opened. A year or so ago I knew things were going downhill when I queued behind an older crowd asking why they were queuing to eat. Today I have visited to find the menu almost unrecognisable. The Philly Cheesesteak has gone forever, as though my heart wasn't broken after they discontinued the Crack Pie made with rum butter. I finally got to try a frozen banana today (my last three attempts here and at Mission failed) and it turned out to be half a banana with the chocolate and nut coating added before it was frozen. Disappointing.	like other reviewers  this used to be my favourite  i ve been supporting this eatery since the days of  meateasy  and was thrilled when a permanent restaurant opened  a year or so ago i knew things were going downhill when i queued behind an older crowd asking why they were queuing to eat  today i have visited to find the menu almost unrecognisable  the philly cheesesteak has gone forever  as though my heart wasn t broken after they discontinued the crack pie made with rum butter  i finally got to try a frozen banana today  my last three attempts here and at mission failed  and it turned out to be half a banana with the chocolate and nut coating added before it was frozen  disappointing

2092	4.0	Meat Liquor is a pretty cool place (although i personally find the fake blood stained plastic curtains around the kitchen a tad creepy) and if you go in for lunch you come out shocked that its daylight. The food is good, it all comes served on one tray. I'd recommend trying the deep fried pickles for something a bit different and if you're after a drink they have some great but lethal cocktails (the one i had they will only serve two per customer). A bit of a different experience and definitely worth a try in my opinion.	meat liquor is a pretty cool place  although i personally find the fake blood stained plastic curtains around the kitchen a tad creepy  and if you go in for lunch you come out shocked that its daylight  the food is good  it all comes served on one tray  i d recommend trying the deep fried pickles for something a bit different and if you re after a drink they have some great but lethal cocktails  the one i had they will only serve two per customer   a bit of a different experience and definitely worth a try in my opinion 
2093	3.0	I cannot comment on the ambience as we had take-away (or let's call it 'takeout' as the food scene in London is being AmericaniZed, what with Puck, Boloud, Jean-Georges Von Re... Von Ri...oh heck, I never remember how to spell his name, the Spice Market guy)I will start by saying that I called to ask if they offer 'takeout' and was give an affirmative reply. Alas, when my colleague went to pickup the food they had NOTHING TO CARRY IT IN.  Poor girl had to balance four burgers, four portions of fries and a portion of buffalo wings, plus some shopping, on her ten minute walk back to the office.  Here's an easy one for the Meat Liquor guys: if you're gonna offer 'takeout', might be worth offering something to 'take-it-out' in... Like a carrier bag, perhaps.Rant over. To the food: the burgers are good. Patty is rough-chopped, if that's your thing, thick and cooked medium. The fillings nice enough: perfect amount of cheese, onion, ketchup, lettuce (good butter lettuce rather than McD's-style cheapo iceberg) and pickle.  The bread slightly sweet and on the chewy side -- a good thing in my view as it means the bun doesn't crumble or dissolve when saturated with the (substantial) 'jus' and grease from the meat patty.  The fries are skinny (hallelujah!) and, in our case, slightly too undercooked in not-quite-hot-enough oil, hence a bit on the greasy side. The buffalo wings are not great.  I think they are broiled rather than deep-fried and not tossed properly in the hot sauce, resulting in a pale appendage with not much punch or flavour.  I mean, you're having burgers and fries so it's not like you're really watching the calories.  Just deep-fry the damn things!Portions are ENORMOUS.  One portion of fries will generously feed two and there must've been about 15 drumlets in the buffalo wings portion. You know what.  This place is good for a city that has never really done the burger thing properly or cheaply. Meat Liquor is pretty cheap and it offers a generous feed. If my colleague's experience is anything to go by, it's also a good place to get chatted up and offered drinks by single American male tourists who hang out at the bar (where 'takeout' also gets order from).  That's about it. All said and done, it's just a burger joint. Probably not worth the big queues... And lack of foresight into the paper-bag thing...one star less for that!	i cannot comment on the ambience as we had take away  or let s call it  takeout  as the food scene in london is being americanized  what with puck  boloud  jean georges von re    von ri   oh heck  i never remember how to spell his name  the spice market guy i will start by saying that i called to ask if they offer  takeout  and was give an affirmative reply  alas  when my colleague went to pickup the food they had nothing to carry it in   poor girl had to balance four burgers  four portions of fries and a portion of buffalo wings  plus some shopping  on her ten minute walk back to the office   here s an easy one for the meat liquor guys  if you re gonna offer  takeout   might be worth offering something to  take it out  in    like a carrier bag  perhaps rant over  to the food  the burgers are good  patty is rough chopped  if that s your thing  thick and cooked medium  the fillings nice enough  perfect amount of cheese  onion  ketchup  lettuce  good butter lettuce rather than mcd s style cheapo iceberg  and pickle   the bread slightly sweet and on the chewy side    a good thing in my view as it means the bun doesn t crumble or dissolve when saturated with the  substantial   jus  and grease from the meat patty   the fries are skinny  hallelujah   and  in our case  slightly too undercooked in not quite hot enough oil  hence a bit on the greasy side  the buffalo wings are not great   i think they are broiled rather than deep fried and not tossed properly in the hot sauce  resulting in a pale appendage with not much punch or flavour   i mean  you re having burgers and fries so it s not like you re really watching the calories   just deep fry the damn things portions are enormous   one portion of fries will generously feed two and there must ve been about 15 drumlets in the buffalo wings portion  you know what   this place is good for a city that has never really done the burger thing properly or cheaply  meat liquor is pretty cheap and it offers a generous feed  if my colleague s experience is anything to go by  it s also a good place to get chatted up and offered drinks by single american male tourists who hang out at the bar  where  takeout  also gets order from    that s about it  all said and done  it s just a burger joint  probably not worth the big queues    and lack of foresight into the paper bag thing   one star less for that 
2094	5.0	Honestly this place just might be my favourite burger place of all time! Considering the fact that I'm American, I have pretty high standards on burgers and this one hits the spot every single time! It's hard to find a good proper American burger in London and so far this is the only place I've found that can do that. The burgers are always nice and juicy and the fries are always hot! The queue can be quite ridiculous at times (I've once waited for two hours in 3 degree weather on a Friday night)... which tells me something though, because I wouldn't do that for any other restaurant I've ever been to. It can be quite loud due to the music and people so I probably wouldn't go on a first date there or anything. The bar is a bit pricey but then again what bar in Central London isn't? The food however is decently priced and you can get a burger and chips for about 10 pounds. In conclusion, I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger- as I'm not sure I'll ever find one anywhere as good as they are here!	honestly this place just might be my favourite burger place of all time  considering the fact that i m american  i have pretty high standards on burgers and this one hits the spot every single time  it s hard to find a good proper american burger in london and so far this is the only place i ve found that can do that  the burgers are always nice and juicy and the fries are always hot  the queue can be quite ridiculous at times  i ve once waited for two hours in 3 degree weather on a friday night     which tells me something though  because i wouldn t do that for any other restaurant i ve ever been to  it can be quite loud due to the music and people so i probably wouldn t go on a first date there or anything  the bar is a bit pricey but then again what bar in central london isn t  the food however is decently priced and you can get a burger and chips for about 10 pounds  in conclusion  i d definitely recommend this place if you re looking for a good burger  as i m not sure i ll ever find one anywhere as good as they are here

We were directed to the bar to wait for our table which is a nifty move as you spend more on drinks. Drinks were nice. We were directed to our table after about 15 mins. We were right at the back were it was very dark. This is the look of the restaurant (an a american dive bar), so not a problem but a bit disorientating in the middle of the day. Food arrived very swiftly and looked plentiful. We ordered dead hippie burgers, chilli fries and deep fried pickles. The latter was very nice but certainly not slimming. I was a little disappointed with the chilli fries, far too much cheese and not enough jalepenos. Burgers were moist but i have to admit, the sauce really reminded me of a big mac. I would return to Meat Liquor but I do know of better burgers.	i went to meat liquor after knowing about it s present for a long time  we went at lunch time  queue was not too bad and we got in after about 20 mins  we were directed to the bar to wait for our table which is a nifty move as you spend more on drinks  drinks were nice  we were directed to our table after about 15 mins  we were right at the back were it was very dark  this is the look of the restaurant  an a american dive bar   so not a problem but a bit disorientating in the middle of the day  food arrived very swiftly and looked plentiful  we ordered dead hippie burgers  chilli fries and deep fried pickles  the latter was very nice but certainly not slimming  i was a little disappointed with the chilli fries  far too much cheese and not enough jalepenos  burgers were moist but i have to admit  the sauce really reminded me of a big mac  i would return to meat liquor but i do know of better burgers

Admittedly we went on a Tues afternoon (12.30ish) but got a table straight away for a party of two, and received wexcellent service. The deepfried pickles and chilli cheese chips are a MUST, and the Time of the Month cocktail a favourite. well worth a visit and great value too! A table for two had 2 cocktails each, 2 burgers, deep-fried pickles and chilli cheese chips for just £50. In the words of Starsky and Hutch, DO IT!	everything they say about this place is true  except the waiting time  admittedly we went on a tues afternoon  12 30ish  but got a table straight away for a party of two  and received wexcellent service  the deepfried pickles and chilli cheese chips are a must  and the time of the month cocktail a favourite  well worth a visit and great value too  a table for two had 2 cocktails each  2 burgers  deep fried pickles and chilli cheese chips for just  50  in the words of starsky and hutch  do it

2099	5.0	Most reviews I've read have been fairly so-so about Meat Liquor but I would readily go there again. My first taste of Meatwagon burgers was at the Meateasy. While it was a good burger it did not make my list as the best ever. Today's burger (a dead hippy) was nothing short of fantastic; a delicious, sloppy burger, nicely pink on the inside and really without fault. Fantastic.I also enjoyed the deep fried pickles, they were nicer than expected (I mainly ordered them out of curiosity) and my only gripe here was that the portion could have been a bit more generous. The venue IMO has a more favourable layout than the Meateasy and the staff were brilliant. Although I had to wait a while for my burger and, as I was sitting at the bar, I at one point was being jostled by some suits, the food and the lovely staff more than made up for that all. I also had a quick chat with one of the owners and he seemed to genuinely care about what I thought of the food. Go, but go early lunchtime or early evening to avoid the queues.	most reviews i ve read have been fairly so so about meat liquor but i would readily go there again  my first taste of meatwagon burgers was at the meateasy  while it was a good burger it did not make my list as the best ever  today s burger  a dead hippy  was nothing short of fantastic  a delicious  sloppy burger  nicely pink on the inside and really without fault  fantastic i also enjoyed the deep fried pickles  they were nicer than expected  i mainly ordered them out of curiosity  and my only gripe here was that the portion could have been a bit more generous  the venue imo has a more favourable layout than the meateasy and the staff were brilliant  although i had to wait a while for my burger and  as i was sitting at the bar  i at one point was being jostled by some suits  the food and the lovely staff more than made up for that all  i also had a quick chat with one of the owners and he seemed to genuinely care about what i thought of the food  go  but go early lunchtime or early evening to avoid the queues 
2100	3.0	What better way to start my long overdue foodie blog than with some meat and some liquor? Friday night saw my second visit to the celebrated resting place of the celebrated Meatwagon, its MEATliquor restaurant on Welbeck Street. After a less than enjoyable first visit before Christmas, I thought I had paid the place my last dues. My initiation was half tainted by understandably unenthusiastic companions (the parents!) and half by the type of hype surrounding the place that only anticipates disappointment (I'm not a hype type-a-gal). Above all, I wasn't crazy about the food. Not wanting to miss out on an evening with friends, however, I went along upon their suggestion.I arrived at the scene on Friday at 8:30pm to find a queue of epic proportions.Yes, it was testing and, yes, it was really cold and, yes, we did endure all 1.75 hours of it (!). I read one tweet that says it all: 'MEATliquor is harder to get into than a nun's knickers.' I have always been inclined to view such queues as purely bad things (I'm not a queue type-a-gal). Thinking outside of my brainbox, however, and I realise a queue as long as this could signal something spectacular at the end. Could it be that I missed something the first time around? Could there be a juicy pot of gold at the end of the giant rainbow?Well, juicy - yes, but golden - not exactly. One enters MEATliquor to find a square room defined by a square arcade that forms a slightly sunken central floor area and seating all around. The ceiling above is domed and adorned with what looks like a rock'n'roll mess of red, white and black. The darkness is almost as heavy as the food. The décor is almost as loud as the music. The room extends in front of you to accommodate a bar area with extra seating towards the back. On both occasions I was seated downstairs, a little offshoot with four sizeable tables. The threshold of the staircase that leads you down here is distinguished by PVC strip curtains smothered in red paint, palpably suggestive of a butcher's and emphasising the meat part of the experience, along with a momentary stench of synthetics as you pass through.Our charmingly chatty waitress brought our food out fairly quickly. The starter tray consisted of deep fried pickles, Buffalo wings, chilli cheese fries and a pork slider. The pickles were a unanimous favourite, tangy and fleshy on the inside and complimented by the crunchy battered crust. The blue cheese dip accentuated the deliciousness of this simple, yet satisfying, offering. Second favourite were the chilli cheese fries, which was essentially just a bowl of irresistible ingredients piled on top of each other, and a generous portion of them too. To quote Joey Tribiani: cheese? Good. Minced beef? Good. Fries? Good. Spice? Goooood!The burgers were how I remember them: a chunky patty of ground beef cooked all the way through. I prefer my burgers slightly pink in the middle, but the meat was still tasty and the bun was soft and squidgy, almost brioche-like. Put together with a base of gherkins, onions and lettuce with cheese on top, the burger is indeed satisfying. For the particularly ravenous, I suggest the Dead Hippie: a double patty burger with special sauce. My issue with MEATliquor's main offering, however, is that it is so oily that your hands will be bathing in a pool of grease by the time you are done. I washed my hands five times, just to be sure (I may be an OCD type-a-gal). With finger food like this, served on a paper-covered metal tray, they should also invest in providing wet wipes, if only to minimise grease-spreading. Each table offers several kitchen towel rolls, but this only goes so far. In fact, each condiment bottle is smeared in its own coating of MEATliquor oil. The fries are also extremely salty, even for me.For desserts we ordered a slice of crack pie and another topped with cream. The crack pie was delicious, with a chewy caramel-like filling nestled in a crumbly cookie crust.MEATliquor brings a New York-style grungy diner experience to London. It is specifically reminiscent of Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridian on West 57th Street. The emphasis here is on the word experience. As one of my companions noted, it is not just a restaurant satisfying your hunger or a watering hole quenching your thirst. It is a complete assault on all five of your senses. It is also more of a trend thing than a taste thing. The burger itself does not make my All Star list and still does not live up to the hype. Even if I did cherish the culinary contributions, the prospect of queuing each time (expect queues from 7pm each day, apparently) scuppers any chance of repeat visits.I do encourage you to try it it if you haven't, but I wouldn't be surprised if your first time is also your last.	what better way to start my long overdue foodie blog than with some meat and some liquor  friday night saw my second

2101	4.0	"If you had the good fortune to visit #meateasy in New Cross in the early months of 2011 you might find Meat Liquor a little bit of a let-down. However, as Hunter himself sort of said: ""the kind of peak that never comes again. New Cross in early 2011 was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words, food, music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . . "" We rocked up at Meat Liquor on a Friday night around 6pm hoping to beat the queue and sure enough we walked straight in and had our choice of tables. Feeling a little bit sensitive after a long hard week we grabbed a table in the slightly quieter area at the back of the restaurant to the left of the bar  this would be a good spot if you are with a large party. The trademark literary 'wallpaper' from the New Cross venue was in place and the dim red lighting, excellent soundtrack and somewhat scatty service made this all feel very familiar despite the new location in the heart of the beast. We kicked off our evening with a selection of cocktails from the very inviting, well-priced drinks menu. As before these well put-together concoctions came in jam jars and really hit the spot. I particularly liked the novel take on the Negroni while the House Grog was a very tasty rum based creeper which is sensibly limited to a maximum order of two per person  not sure the good Doctor would have approved of this bit of nannying though. We teamed our drinks up with the already legendary deep-fried pickles, which  trust me on this one- no trip to Meat Liquor should be without. Suitably lubricated we were now ready for our burgers and despite the carnage around us in the fast filling restaurant we managed to get the attention of a charming burgerette and place our order. Half an hour later we were deep into burger heaven. My chilli burger was just lovely with plenty of heat and a great charred patty packing plenty of flavour. I tried a small bite of B's chilli chicken burger and for one brief moment had a touch of the food envy. Our dining companions, big Phil and the delightful Kate (who had been mistaken for a stripper from the club next door) were also swooning over their choices and comparing the Meat Liquor offering very favourably with the burgers they had enjoyed during the summer at The Rye. The side dishes, and in particular the fries, are a big improvement on the New Cross days. The slaw was very tasty and for those folk who don't get what this place is all about, there is a red neon sign bearing the legend meat over the front door, you even have a small rabbit food section on the menu. We washed all this meaty goodness down with some fine wine from the short but well put together and reasonably priced wine list. Not sure I noticed it on our visit but anywhere with wine by the awesome Charles Smith on the wine list gets a big thumbs up from me. We left at some point around 9pm well fed, with our wallets intact and glad we were not in the ever growing queue of foodie hipsters snaking their way down the street. This year has seen me on a bit of a burger pilgrimage around the capital and Meat Liquor is definitely top five in my book. This dark, dirty, sexy dive of a place will definitely not be too everyone's taste but we are already planning a return visit in the New Year."	if you had the good fortune to visit  meateasy in new cross in the early months of 2011 you might find meat liquor a little bit of a let down  however  as hunter himself sort of said   the kind of peak that never comes again  new cross in early 2011 was a very special time and place to be a part of  maybe it meant something  maybe not  in the long run       but no explanation  no mix of words  food  music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world  whatever it meant          we rocked up at meat liquor on a friday night around 6pm hoping to beat the queue and sure enough we walked straight in and had our choice of tables  feeling a little bit sensitive after a long hard week we grabbed a table in the slightly quieter area at the back of the restaurant to the left of the bar  this would be a good spot if you are with a large party  the trademark literary  wallpaper  from the new cross venue was in place and the dim red lighting  excellent soundtrack and somewhat scatty service made this all feel very familiar despite the new location in the heart of the beast  we kicked off our evening with a selection of cocktails from the very inviting  well priced drinks menu  as before these well put together concoctions came in jam jars and really hit the spot  i particularly liked the novel take on the negroni while the house grog was a very tasty rum based creeper which is sensibly limited to a maximum order of two per person  not sure the good doctor would have approved of this bit of nannying though  we teamed our drinks up with the already legendary deep fried pickles  which  trust me on this one  no trip to meat liquor should be without  suitably lubricated we were now ready for our burgers and despite the carnage around us in the fast filling restaurant we managed to get the attention of a charming burgerette and place our order  half an hour later we were deep into burger heaven  my chilli burger was just lovely with plenty of heat and a great charred patty packing plenty of flavour  i tried a small bite of b s chilli chicken burger and for one brief moment had a touch of the food envy  our dining companions  big phil and the delightful kate  who had been mistaken for a stripper from the club next door  were also swooning over their choices and comparing the meat liquor offering very favourably with the burgers they had enjoyed during the summer at the rye  the side dishes  and in particular the fries  are a big improvement on the new cross days  the slaw was very tasty and for those folk who don t get what this place is all about  there is a red neon sign bearing the legend meat over the front door  you even have a small rabbit food section on the menu  we washed all this meaty goodness down with some fine wine from the short but well put together and reasonably priced wine list  not sure i noticed it on our visit but anywhere with wine by the awesome charles smith on the wine list gets a big thumbs up from me  we left at some point around 9pm well fed  with our wallets intact and glad we were not in the ever growing queue of foodie hipsters snaking their way down the street  this year has seen me on a bit of a burger pilgrimage around the capital and meat liquor is definitely top five in my book  this dark  dirty  sexy dive of a place will definitely not be too everyone s taste but we are already planning a return visit in the new year

2103	2.0	After all the hype about this place, I decided to make my way through the long queue and try what is considered the best burger in town.Well, the question in my head after we left was a loud WHY?!, why do people queue so long for a burger? Why did I want to queue 50 minutes in the cold and another 40 inside for an OK burger?The answer is al down to very good marketing/PR, to which I completely bow to! Well done!Don't get me wrong, the burger was nice, but quite rather small, and honestly I have tasted better in London. The menu selection is quite small, which is not a bad thing; I had a bacon cheeseburger and of bacon I could taste none. The chilli cheese fries were delicious, despite staying with me until the following morning, not a good feeling.The venue is loud and greasy  it reminded me of a student union bar with heavy metal music. The cocktail list was fantastic though, despite not actually ordering any.All in all, I left feeling that the long wait is definitely not worth!

2104	2.0	i'm not really a red meat girl. i tend to not eat it, but if i'm going to a place like meat liquor then i'm going to have a burger, a red meat burger...actually the only reason i don't eat red meat is cos i used to love burgers a bit too much, so in order to ensure i live for longer i went cold turkey! i break cold turkey every now and again cos life is too short to not have burger-related joy in it at all...that being said, i came here with my boyfriend and a friend. it was a tuesday night just after 6pm and we miraculously walked in with no queue. i'd be pissed if i queued for ages to get in here, so thankfully we didn't!it's dark inside, it's loud, it's warm. service was fine - it wasn't friendly by any stretch of the imagination, pretty brusque but fine. the food that we shared - the bingo wings, seriously bodeans are waaaaaaaaay better, go there if you crave wings. the chilli cheese fries were pretty gross - the chips were like bad mcdonald's fries, and the deep fried pickles, ohmygaaaaaad, seriously greasy and not good. i love pickles and i really love blue cheese so i wanted to love these so bad. i didn't. i had the green chilli burger which was very spicy. i like spice so appreciated that when they say green chilli burger they do actually mean chilli. i don't like how soggy and gross the burger gets as you eat it. i just don't enjoy that. i gave up on the bun and ate the burger on its own and the quality of the meat is good, and it's well cooked, but as an overall package i'm not digging it. so, i didn't enjoy my experience. i think it's overhyped and the food is not worth it, BUT saying that, my boyfriend and friend did enjoy it, so obviously i'm one of a lonely few that isn't impressed by this place. also, in terms of value for money, this place is that...but worth is more than just the cost, and it's not worth queuing for in my opinion. i'm glad i've been only so that i now know i'm not missing out on anything life-changing!	i m not really a red meat girl  i tend to not eat it  but if i m going to a place like meat liquor then i m going to have a burger  a red meat burger   actually the only reason i don t eat red meat is cos i used to love burgers a bit too much  so in order to ensure i live for longer i went cold turkey  i break cold turkey every now and again cos life is too short to not have burger related joy in it at all   that being said  i came here with my boyfriend and a friend  it was a tuesday night just after 6pm and we miraculously walked in with no queue  i d be pissed if i queued for ages to get in here  so thankfully we didn t it s dark inside  it s loud  it s warm  service was fine   it wasn t friendly by any stretch of the imagination  pretty brusque but fine  the food that we shared   the bingo wings  seriously bodeans are waaaaaaaaay better  go there if you crave wings  the chilli cheese fries were pretty gross   the chips were like bad mcdonald s fries  and the deep fried pickles  ohmygaaaaaad  seriously greasy and not good  i love pickles and i really love blue cheese so i wanted to love these so bad  i didn t  i had the green chilli burger which was very spicy  i like spice so appreciated that when they say green chilli burger they do actually mean chilli  i don t like how soggy and gross the burger gets as you eat it  i just don t enjoy that  i gave up on the bun and ate the burger on its own and the quality of the meat is good  and it s well cooked  but as an overall package i m not digging it  so  i didn t enjoy my experience  i think it s overhyped and the food is not worth it  but saying that  my boyfriend and friend did enjoy it  so obviously i m one of a lonely few that isn t impressed by this place  also  in terms of value for money  this place is that   but worth is more than just the cost  and it s not worth queuing for in my opinion  i m glad i ve been only so that i now know i m not missing out on anything life changing

In fact the only burger place I prefer is sister restaurant Meat Mission (you can book and the menu is even better). The burgers are superb. Possibly not the absolute best burgers in London, but for me it beats some of the other places by having a more interesting menu. The chilli cheese fries are to die for (and a meal in themselves, watch out!). The deep fried pickles with the blue cheese dip are heaven (and I don't even like pickles!). The onion rings are enormous but keep the right balance of onion and batter. And then the burgers... if you're really up for it, go for the dead hippie (two patties). I find the regular cheeseburger is enough for me. (By the way I love spicy food but the green chilli burger blew my head off... it was too much). It all arrives on a single tray for the table, which can make sharing difficult but you'll work it out. It's totally about getting stuck in and eating everything with your hands (except perhaps the chilli cheese fries). There's kitchen roll provided to help mop up but if you escape without a single drop of burger grease down your front it's a miracle.

2107	2.0	"It's simple food and tastes pretty good; not too expensive; staff were friendly.  BUT, it is NOT worth a wait of over an hour on a Tuesday for what it is.  In short, it's over-hyped and I think a lot of the reviewers that rate it so highly don't have a good frame of reference.We went at 8pm on a Tuesday, knowing that there is often a bit of a queue (but expected less so on a Tues). The 3 of us waited 45 minutes to get to the door, then when we were let inside we were placed to the side and waited another 10 minutes while the hostess just looked around bored.  Then she told us we were to wait by the bar and it would take another 15 minutes.  Already we were debating whether to be unimpressed or maybe the the burgers would be an amazing meat orgasm in your mouth so that it's worth it.  At the bar we got 2 fresh orange juices (£3 each), yet the glasses they were in were rammed with so much ice there wasn't much of a drink, and a can of beer (£4) - yes, served in the can.We finally got seated at a communal table, ordered fairly quickly.  The food came out pretty promptly so no fault there.  And the style of the place is obviously ""grunge"" so it wasn't that surprising that it's served directly on a tray (no plates) and your only solution for putting your meal in front of you is to use one of the rolls of paper towels to fashion yourself a makeshift plate / place-setting.  Simple, somewhat practical - I get it - but the establishment's shrewdness doesn't solicit 4 or 5 stars.  Plus the dark ambience is part of the simple / dingy scene but it's pretty challenging to read a menu or to discern what the gooey stuff is on the burger (did I order that stuff on there or not?).In the end the burger was decent and not pricey; the chili burger was extremely spicy (be warned) and a bit sloppy; the dirty chicken burger was a bit blah.  good fries. The dark setting didn't aid in catching the eye of our waitress while we were finished and waiting for our check longer than it took to eat our meals.That was our first experience there, and probably our only.  It wasn't worth the wait, not worthy of the hype, and I could definitely come up with better burger ideas elsewhere that would either taste better and/or serve you cleaner & quicker."	it s simple food and tastes pretty good  not too expensive  staff were friendly   but  it is not worth a wait of over an hour on a tuesday for what it is   in short  it s over hyped and i think a lot of the reviewers that rate it so highly don t have a good frame of reference we went at 8pm on a tuesday  knowing that there is often a bit of a queue  but expected less so on a tues   the 3 of us waited 45 minutes to get to the door  then when we were let inside we were placed to the side and waited another 10 minutes while the hostess just looked around bored   then she told us we were to wait by the bar and it would take another 15 minutes   already we were debating whether to be unimpressed or maybe the the burgers would be an amazing meat orgasm in your mouth so that it s worth it   at the bar we got 2 fresh orange juices   3 each   yet the glasses they were in were rammed with so much ice there wasn t much of a drink  and a can of beer   4    yes  served in the can we finally got seated at a communal table  ordered fairly quickly   the food came out pretty promptly so no fault there   and the style of the place is obviously  grunge  so it wasn t that surprising that it s served directly on a tray  no plates  and your only solution for putting your meal in front of you is to use one of the rolls of paper towels to fashion yourself a makeshift plate   place setting   simple  somewhat practical   i get it   but the establishment s shrewdness doesn t solicit 4 or 5 stars   plus the dark ambience is part of the simple   dingy scene but it s pretty challenging to read a menu or to discern what the gooey stuff is on the burger  did i order that stuff on there or not   in the end the burger was decent and not pricey  the chili burger was extremely spicy  be warned  and a bit sloppy  the dirty chicken burger was a bit blah   good fries  the dark setting didn t aid in catching the eye of our waitress while we were finished and waiting for our check longer than it took to eat our meals that was our first experience there  and probably our only   it wasn t worth the wait  not worthy of the hype  and i could definitely come up with better burger ideas elsewhere that would either taste better and or serve you cleaner   quicker 
2108	4.0	The only reason I do not give this five stars is due to the price, although this is the west end and it is therefore to be expected. Go at 4.00 and get seated straightaway - no queue. Very cool, a place to see and be seen. Food great - the famous dead hippy burger is sloppy but great and the Bingo Wings amazing. Pair with Philly Cheese Fries and your favourite soft drink for a great combination. Well worth a visit for all burger lovers, it is truly hard to beat.	the only reason i do not give this five stars is due to the price  although this is the west end and it is therefore to be expected  go at 4 00 and get seated straightaway   no queue  very cool  a place to see and be seen  food great   the famous dead hippy burger is sloppy but great and the bingo wings amazing  pair with philly cheese fries and your favourite soft drink for a great combination  well worth a visit for all burger lovers  it is truly hard to beat 
2109	2.0	Style over substance in a really big way.The good: The burger is nice, batter on onion rings and pickles is crisp. The place is a bit different to your usual burger bar. I won't say unique, it isn't unique. The bad: The line outside is more about generating hype than any practical consideration. It works, sad little plebs like us diligently line up for a glorified Burger King. The food is not exceptional. Certainly not £40 for two burgers and a few beers sort of good. The service is hit and miss, it can be alright or you can wait 15 minutes for a drink and have a can of beer thrust at you by a surly waitress who then tries to take your tray before you've finished eating. The music is loud. Unfortunately it is not always good. It tries so very hard to be badass it's almost embarrassing. They've picked the most hipster staff, painted some naked women and skulls on the wall and played some Motorhead. At worst this is a deeply mediocre fast food joint. At best it's a cool place to go if you're drinking in the area, don't mind the wait and want to tell everybody about the super trendy burger you just had. I think this is its undoing. Is it a dive bar? Because that's what the damp paper menu and sticky floor suggests. Is it a club, loud music, darkened windows and the line outside would make you think so. Is it a diner, because the food is greasy and uncomplicated? It shoots for all these things, nails none of them. If it wasn't so firmly up its own backside, I'd like it a lot more. You line up for ages to stand at an overcrowded bar, drink overpriced beer, get hustled to a table where it's too loud to talk but it's a restaurant so you can't dance, but the lights are down so low you can't see the menu but it doesn't matter because the staff have forgotten you exist...you wait an age for service in a mixture of rubbernecking silence and REALLY LOUD SHOUTING. You eat a tepid, very greasy burger (it's okay, they give you a kitchen roll instead of napkins, stick it to the man with his napkins etc) and get shooed out onto the street as soon as they can get you to pay the inexplicably high bill. Won't rush back.	style over substance in a really big way the good  the burger is nice  batter on onion rings and pickles is crisp  the place is a bit different to your usual burger bar  i won t say unique  it isn t unique  the bad  the line outside is more about generating hype than any practical consideration  it works  sad little plebs like us diligently line up for a glorified burger king  the food is not exceptional  certainly not  40 for two burgers and a few beers sort of good  the service is hit and miss  it can be alright or you can wait 15 minutes for a drink and have a can of beer thrust at you by a surly waitress who then tries to take your tray before you ve finished eating  the music is loud  unfortunately it is not always good  it tries so very hard to be badass it s almost embarrassing  they ve picked the most hipster staff  painted some naked women and skulls on the wall and played some motorhead  at worst this is a deeply mediocre fast food joint  at best it s a cool place to go if you re drinking in the area  don t mind the wait and want to tell everybody about the super trendy burger you just had  i think this is its undoing  is it a dive bar  because that s what the damp paper menu and sticky floor suggests  is it a club  loud music  darkened windows and the line outside would make you think so  is it a diner  because the food is greasy and uncomplicated  it shoots for all these things  nails none of them  if it wasn t so firmly up its own backside  i d like it a lot more  you line up for ages to stand at an overcrowded bar  drink overpriced beer  get hustled to a table where it s too loud to talk but it s a restaurant so you can t dance  but the lights are down so low you can t see the menu but it doesn t matter because the staff have forgotten you exist   you wait an age for service in a mixture of rubbernecking silence and really loud shouting  you eat a tepid  very greasy burger  it s okay  they give you a kitchen roll instead of napkins  stick it to the man with his napkins etc  and get shooed out onto the street as soon as they can get you to pay the inexplicably high bill  won t rush back 
2110	4.0	People say it's good? It is. I am not convinced, that's it is the single best burger in London, but without a doubt, it's among the best burgers in town. I went there on a Saturday afternoon and queued for only about 15 minutes. This place seems to be somewhat uberhyped, but despite the fries are not spectacular, the burgers are great. As it was kind of busy, I got a place at the bar. Which is okay, the staff are nice, but still constantly rushing around you. Although most of them are quite stylish (whatever this exactly means), sort of hipster-esque and nice to look at, sitting in a busy corner isn't always the best experience. Unfortunately then a group was said to wait just next to me at the bar for their table, which didn't make my place more convenient. But the bustle and that aside, it's a cool place for a tasty burger. You shouldn't expect too much perhaps, but if you don't queue too long, it's definitely worth a visit.	people say it s good  it is  i am not convinced  that s it is the single best burger in london  but without a doubt  it s among the best burgers in town  i went there on a saturday afternoon and queued for only about 15 minutes  this place seems to be somewhat uberhyped  but despite the fries are not spectacular  the burgers are great  as it was kind of busy  i got a place at the bar  which is okay  the staff are nice  but still constantly rushing around you  although most of them are quite stylish  whatever this exactly means   sort of hipster esque and nice to look at  sitting in a busy corner isn t always the best experience  unfortunately then a group was said to wait just next to me at the bar for their table  which didn t make my place more convenient  but the bustle and that aside  it s a cool place for a tasty burger  you shouldn t expect too much perhaps  but if you don t queue too long  it s definitely worth a visit 
2111	5.0	Now then. As many have said, meat liquor isn't just about the burgers. It's about the queuing. The lovely people who own the restaurant have decided to not allow bookings. While this is great for those of us who are disorganised, the slightly OCD crew who book restaurants, cinemas and theatres months in advance are feeling at a great disadvantage. So here's the deal. We queued. I think it took us nearly an hour to get from the parking entrance to the front door. And then another 30min at the bar (having absolutely delicious cocktails  and based on feedback from the boys, DO try the grog) before they found us a table. Well, we were 8 very hungry people. It's not that easy to sit a table of 8! Then we did sit. Service came quickly and was efficient. Food appeared soon thereafter, on platters. No plates, btw. So make good use of the provided kitchen towels and cover the table in front of you as well as your lap. Oh, and do try the chilli cheese fries, they are to die for! Then the burgers came! Goodness, they were GOOD! I cannot describe it. Good bread, good quality ingredients, good meat, cooked to perfection (all medium to medium-well), and the bacon in my cheeseburger was deliciously ever so slightly crunchy and didn't have the typical ribbon of fat on the side. Perhaps they thought to trim it? Who knows! Overall, I truly enjoyed the burger, the entrees (chilli cheese fries for the win!), the dribbliness of everything, the MEAT, and, of course, the cocktails! No wonder it's called meat liquor. Amusingly enough, some cocktails cost more than the burgers. Truly sensible pricing. And for a hugely hyped place in central London! Well done!! Oh, one word of advice. Don't wear your best clothes. Accidents happen, there are no plates, and the environment / decor is slightly grungy. Suits won't fit in, unless it's post-fight-club.	now then  as many have said  meat liquor isn t just about the burgers  it s about the queuing  the lovely people who own the restaurant have decided to not allow bookings  while this is great for those of us who are disorganised  the slightly ocd crew who book restaurants  cinemas and theatres months in advance are feeling at a great disadvantage  so here s the deal  we queued  i think it took us nearly an hour to get from the parking entrance to the front door  and then another 30min at the bar  having absolutely delicious cocktails  and based on feedback from the boys  do try the grog  before they found us a table  well  we were 8 very hungry people  it s not that easy to sit a table of 8  then we did sit  service came quickly and was efficient  food appeared soon thereafter  on platters  no plates  btw  so make good use of the provided kitchen towels and cover the table in front of you as well as your lap  oh  and do try the chilli cheese fries  they are to die for  then the burgers came  goodness  they were good  i cannot describe it  good bread  good quality ingredients  good meat  cooked to perfection  all medium to medium well   and the bacon in my cheeseburger was deliciously ever so slightly crunchy and didn t have the typical ribbon of fat on the side  perhaps they thought to trim it  who knows  overall  i truly enjoyed the burger  the entrees  chilli cheese fries for the win    the dribbliness of everything  the meat  and  of course  the cocktails  no wonder it s called meat liquor  amusingly enough  some cocktails cost more than the burgers  truly sensible pricing  and for a hugely hyped place in central london  well done   oh  one word of advice  don t wear your best clothes  accidents happen  there are no plates  and the environment   decor is slightly grungy  suits won t fit in  unless it s post fight club 
2112	3.0	Very tasty but there are down sides. The queuing system is frustrating and militant. I know it couldn't be any other way, but hanging around at the bar when you want to be seated and eat just isn't my thing. People should definitely go there, but for me it'll only the once, I think. Super greasy and super rich. The chilli cheese fries were good but got too much. The meals are just so heavy it makes you feel sluggish and I didn't even eat dinner that night (good value for money?) You only need to get one side  Don't go over board. The fries themselves were also a little plain.I just don't think I could face it again.	very tasty but there are down sides  the queuing system is frustrating and militant  i know it couldn t be any other way  but hanging around at the bar when you want to be seated and eat just isn t my thing  people should definitely go there  but for me it ll only the once  i think  super greasy and super rich  the chilli cheese fries were good but got too much  the meals are just so heavy it makes you feel sluggish and i didn t even eat dinner that night  good value for money   you only need to get one side  don t go over board  the fries themselves were also a little plain i just don t think i could face it again 
2113	5.0	Any burger joint that offers a kitchen roll on each table and deep fried pickles with bleu cheese dip on the menu earns an A+ in my book. I love the simple packaging: no-fuss bun, simple dressing (thick-sliced, flavourful pickles). Extras like bacon and chili are perfect enhancements, in just enough volume and with just enough kick to add to the flavour without overwhelming the meat, which is perfectly seasoned and cooked a perfect medium, which the cheese slice melted just so on top. Burgers are the perfect size. Buffalo wings are easily the best in London. Other pluses: Friendly, attentive service  Excellent front of house team. Fun, appropriate music (as opposed to the Korean joint M & I visited last night that was pumping deep house, which most certainly did not add to the kimchi experience). Great pricing (£7 burgers!), especially in the midst of Tourist Central. Great drinks  non-alcholic ones served in mason jars and boozy ones in frosted steins  what more can you ask for?? Have yet to try the rabbit food options on the menu and don't see it happening anytime soon Only downsides are long queues but off-peak hours work a charm. Wear clothes appropriate for burger juices running down your forearms. Sounds like heaven? It is.	any burger joint that offers a kitchen roll on each table and deep fried pickles with bleu cheese dip on the menu earns an a  in my book  i love the simple packaging  no fuss bun  simple dressing  thick sliced  flavourful pickles   extras like bacon and chili are perfect enhancements  in just enough volume and with just enough kick to add to the flavour without overwhelming the meat  which is perfectly seasoned and cooked a perfect medium  which the cheese slice melted just so on top  burgers are the perfect size  buffalo wings are easily the best in london  other pluses  friendly  attentive service  excellent front of house team  fun  appropriate music  as opposed to the korean joint m   i visited last night that was pumping deep house  which most certainly did not add to the kimchi experience   great pricing   7 burgers    especially in the midst of tourist central  great drinks  non alcholic ones served in mason jars and boozy ones in frosted steins  what more can you ask for   have yet to try the rabbit food options on the menu and don t see it happening anytime soon only downsides are long queues but off peak hours work a charm  wear clothes appropriate for burger juices running down your forearms  sounds like heaven  it is 
2114	2.0	Honestly, I really don't understand what all of the hype is about. I went to Meat Liquor on a Thursday at 7, so it definitely wasn't packed. Found a table and ordered the buffalo wings, mac n' cheese, chilli cheese fries, a dead hippie and a chilli cheese burger. The food arrived in a timely matter, but the mac n' cheese was a bit cold and the cheese didn't seem to be distributed throughout rather just on top and underneath the macaroni was bland and dry. Buffalo wings normally have a spicy buffalo sauce which was no where in sight. My friend really enjoyed her chilli cheese burger and overall the dead hippie was good, but definitely not worth the hike and maybe not even worth my traveling time from Angel to Marylebone. The flavors were there, but a pool of oil gushed out from my burger. Yes, I checked to see if it was just the juices from my burger. Unfortunately, it was just oil, which is odd since my friend's burger didn't have this oily pool going on. So I was a bit underwhelmed by the burgers, but what was shocking was the service here. It took less time to eat then to catch the waitress' attention to have my order taken. Also had to wait 15 minutes for the bill to come although it wasn't that busy. The waitresses seem inexperienced and clueless. There is no kind of service and maybe I'm just critical because I work in the industry as well, but it was just shocking. On another note, there are two great wines in stock at Meat Liquor. Both wines are produced by Charles Smith (used to be in the rock business so definitely fits with the decor), for a great Merlot I'd suggest the Velvet Devil. For something crisp and with floral undertones go for the Kung Fu Girl Riesling. I normally hate whites, but this one is fantastic. Anyways, I'd rather go to Hawksmoor or even Goodman for a burger.

2118	3.0	"Went here with my sister in October 2018 for dinner as she raved about how it was legitimately the best Mexican food ever - a lofty statement seeing as how we currently live in Las Vegas, in the USA and are from Texas (aka, we've grown up with Mexican food our entire lives.)Table service is a bit cramped for diners eating right next to the front door. There was a bit of a pile up at dinner time as people rushed to get on the waiting list, which caused the bar to be backed up as people couldn't get around the crowd at the door. We ended up eating downstairs. Service was friendly and prompt. I was shocked at how spicy the salsa sampler was, as I'm the kind of person that order a ""10 level spicy"" at Thai restaurants. It was good, but I definitely needed some milk to wash it down with to counteract the heat. Chicken tinga tacos are okay. The portion looks small but is filling. I would not recommend the chicken soup. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something bitter in it that did not sit well on my palette. Prices are a little steep, but as a tourist, I'm not sure if that's because of the location and it's comparably priced, or it's simply pricey because it's a specialty cuisine. Was it the best Mexican food I've ever had? It's better than many places I've eaten in Mexico itself, but I think my sister over exaggerated a bit in her praises. That said, after hoping all over Europe, this was the one place  where I felt like I was back in the US (yes, Mexican food feels like home to this American) and I would definitely stop by if I was homesick for Mexican food."	went here with my sister in october 2018 for dinner as she raved about how it was legitimately the best mexican food ever   a lofty statement seeing as how we currently live in las vegas  in the usa and are from texas  aka  we ve grown up with mexican food our entire lives  table service is a bit cramped for diners eating right next to the front door  there was a bit of a pile up at dinner time as people rushed to get on the waiting list  which caused the bar to be backed up as people couldn t get around the crowd at the door  we ended up eating downstairs  service was friendly and prompt  i was shocked at how spicy the salsa sampler was  as i m the kind of person that order a  10 level spicy  at thai restaurants  it was good  but i definitely needed some milk to wash it down with to counteract the heat  chicken tinga tacos are okay  the portion looks small but is filling  i would not recommend the chicken soup  i can t put my finger on it  but there was something bitter in it that did not sit well on my palette  prices are a little steep  but as a tourist  i m not sure if that s because of the location and it s comparably priced  or it s simply pricey because it s a specialty cuisine  was it the best mexican food i ve ever had  it s better than many places i ve eaten in mexico itself  but i think my sister over exaggerated a bit in her praises  that said  after hoping all over europe  this was the one place  where i felt like i was back in the us  yes  mexican food feels like home to this american  and i would definitely stop by if i was homesick for mexican food 
2119	2.0	Stopped in for a late afternoon snack & to rest my marching feet.Had the chicken tacos & a Corona. It helped quiet my stomach but was overly seasoned with heat spices. I could handle it, since I like spicy food but others should be warned. Also £7 is a bit much for what's essentially an appetiser.Service is pleasant & quick though.	stopped in for a late afternoon snack   to rest my marching feet had the chicken tacos   a corona  it helped quiet my stomach but was overly seasoned with heat spices  i could handle it  since i like spicy food but others should be warned  also  7 is a bit much for what s essentially an appetiser service is pleasant   quick though

I'm not rushing back to this place anytime soon.	decent food with excellent customer service  they voluntarily remade my vegan burrito  after i was not pleased with the first one   nonetheless  the food is good not great  i m not rushing back to this place anytime soon 
2121	4.0	I came to Lupita once a few years ago on my own. It was lunch time so I just ordered some tacos and I remember clearly my bill for a soft drink and these two tiny (but tasty) tacos being over £10. I left hungry and feeling hard done by.But one trip isn't enough to make an opinion in most cases, so we were in the area to go to the theatre and I decided we'd give it a go again - and it was a good call!This time I just got a couple of small things - some chicken taquitos and a queso dip with chorizo. Both things were totally delicious - and filling. The service was satisfactory, and the prices what you'd expect for the area. I'm pleased I gave it another go, and concede my first experience was poor ordering - definitely going back soon!	i came to lupita once a few years ago on my own  it was lunch time so i just ordered some tacos and i remember clearly my bill for a soft drink and these two tiny  but tasty  tacos being over  10  i left hungry and feeling hard done by but one trip isn t enough to make an opinion in most cases  so we were in the area to go to the theatre and i decided we d give it a go again   and it was a good call this time i just got a couple of small things   some chicken taquitos and a queso dip with chorizo  both things were totally delicious   and filling  the service was satisfactory  and the prices what you d expect for the area  i m pleased i gave it another go  and concede my first experience was poor ordering   definitely going back soon 
2122	5.0	Stopped by here for a late night bite and was craving ceviche in London!  It was a busy night considering it was a Thursday, We were immediately greeted and seated.  The food came pretty quick. Lupita did not disappoint, everything was excellent all the way to the service.  Todd was awesome!  The fish ceviche was so delicious and you must try the baja tacos OMG it was to die for.  The classic margarita was the bomb!  I highly recommend this place! its a casual place, nothing fancy.	stopped by here for a late night bite and was craving ceviche in london   it was a busy night considering it was a thursday  we were immediately greeted and seated   the food came pretty quick  lupita did not disappoint  everything was excellent all the way to the service   todd was awesome   the fish ceviche was so delicious and you must try the baja tacos omg it was to die for   the classic margarita was the bomb   i highly recommend this place  its a casual place  nothing fancy 
2123	4.0	After traversing the cold streets of London, my sister and I were exhausted and very hungry. During our travels, we happened upon Lupita. From outside Lupita seemed fairly busy, and most importantly, warm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a hostess that sat us right away. She could probably sense the exhaustion and hunger we conveyed and asked what we wanted. Without any thought, I said I'd have a Margarita, on the rocks, and my sister wanted one as well. As sipped our yummy Margaritas we perused the menu. Everything looked great. We decided to start with guacamole. It isn't a Mexican meal unless you have some guacamole. The guacamole was good, and a perfect start to our meal. I then ordered a chicken tinga quesadilla. The quesadilla was exactly what I needed. It filled and warmed me up. My sister got chicken tinga torta and enjoyed it as well.I was actually really impressed with Lupita once I was done with my meal. I knew London had good food, but I didn't know if they'd be able to make good Mexican food. I really liked my experience and meal, and would definitely visit again given the chance.	after traversing the cold streets of london  my sister and i were exhausted and very hungry  during our travels  we happened upon lupita  from outside lupita seemed fairly busy  and most importantly  warm  we walked in and were immediately greeted by a hostess that sat us right away  she could probably sense the exhaustion and hunger we conveyed and asked what we wanted  without any thought  i said i d have a margarita  on the rocks  and my sister wanted one as well  as sipped our yummy margaritas we perused the menu  everything looked great  we decided to start with guacamole  it isn t a mexican meal unless you have some guacamole  the guacamole was good  and a perfect start to our meal  i then ordered a chicken tinga quesadilla  the quesadilla was exactly what i needed  it filled and warmed me up  my sister got chicken tinga torta and enjoyed it as well i was actually really impressed with lupita once i was done with my meal  i knew london had good food  but i didn t know if they d be able to make good mexican food  i really liked my experience and meal  and would definitely visit again given the chance 
2124	5.0	Mexican food is my favorite food on the planet and as tourists from the southwest in the USA, we really just went here for the irony of eating TexMex in London. This food was amazing; honestly some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Completely unexpected and a really nice surprise. It's on the pricey side, but isn't everything in London? For three of us to have an appetizer, drinks, and entrees it was around £70.	mexican food is my favorite food on the planet and as tourists from the southwest in the usa  we really just went here for the irony of eating texmex in london  this food was amazing  honestly some of the best mexican food i ve ever had  completely unexpected and a really nice surprise  it s on the pricey side  but isn t everything in london  for three of us to have an appetizer  drinks  and entrees it was around  70 
2125	3.0	I love Mexican food and I wanted to try Lupita long time ago. Lupita is a very a very popular Mexican restaurant, and one of the branches is very close to Trafalgar Square. I dont think it has many options for vegetarians. Also I found it a bit too expensive: 2 small dishes (corn soup and quesadillas), a non alcoholic drink and nachos to share was £20 per person.	i love mexican food and i wanted to try lupita long time ago  lupita is a very a very popular mexican restaurant  and one of the branches is very close to trafalgar square  i dont think it has many options for vegetarians  also i found it a bit too expensive  2 small dishes  corn soup and quesadillas   a non alcoholic drink and nachos to share was  20 per person 
2126	4.0	Happily found Lupita open after 11pm on our last night in London a few weeks ago. After hours of walking around and seeing the sights we were pointed down the Embankment area for food and were surprised to see the string of shops and small restaurants that lined the street. Unfortunately, we were too late for some of the options but Lupita turned out to be exactly what we needed. Their taco plates were great, service was quick and friendly and their passion fruit margarita was tasty. We probably didn't need a second order that late at night be we went with an order of Chicken Tinga tacos anyway. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Mexican. Even for a Texan this is close enough to home to count!	happily found lupita open after 11pm on our last night in london a few weeks ago  after hours of walking around and seeing the sights we were pointed down the embankment area for food and were surprised to see the string of shops and small restaurants that lined the street  unfortunately  we were too late for some of the options but lupita turned out to be exactly what we needed  their taco plates were great  service was quick and friendly and their passion fruit margarita was tasty  we probably didn t need a second order that late at night be we went with an order of chicken tinga tacos anyway  i d highly recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic mexican  even for a texan this is close enough to home to count 
2127	4.0	I was raised in California and my favourite thing is the amazing and delicious foods of Mexico. California is lucky enough to share a border with Mexico and share some amazing restaurant. One of my longest quests has been finding good Mexican food in London that can hold up to the dishes back home. Last night I tried Lupita for the first time and overall I really enjoyed the experience. The food came out very quickly and the portions look very small. However I was surprised at how filling everything was. Every dish had its own flavour and nothing was bland. I wish there was sour cream instead of creme fraiche but c'est la vie.I had the sopa de tortilla which was very delicious and a very generous portion. I also had a refried bean and avocado quesadilla. The quesadilla was packed full of delicious cheese and avocado and the refried beans were really nice. They had a great texture and weren't too watery or dried up. My sister had the cactus and avocado salad and carnitas tacos. She enjoyed both dishes very much. We also shared some homemade tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was very nice and the pico de gallo was fresh and flavourful. All washed down with some yummy cocktails. The service was pleasant and the decor is nice (although look out for the glass screen by the toilets it's easy to miss and walk into).	i was raised in california and my favourite thing is the amazing and delicious foods of mexico  california is lucky enough to share a border with mexico and share some amazing restaurant  one of my longest quests has been finding good mexican food in london that can hold up to the dishes back home  last night i tried lupita for the first time and overall i really enjoyed the experience  the food came out very quickly and the portions look very small  however i was surprised at how filling everything was  every dish had its own flavour and nothing was bland  i wish there was sour cream instead of creme fraiche but c est la vie i had the sopa de tortilla which was very delicious and a very generous portion  i also had a refried bean and avocado quesadilla  the quesadilla was packed full of delicious cheese and avocado and the refried beans were really nice  they had a great texture and weren t too watery or dried up  my sister had the cactus and avocado salad and carnitas tacos  she enjoyed both dishes very much  we also shared some homemade tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa  the guacamole was very nice and the pico de gallo was fresh and flavourful  all washed down with some yummy cocktails  the service was pleasant and the decor is nice  although look out for the glass screen by the toilets it s easy to miss and walk into

2129	3.0	"It's interesting...Mexican food is ""all the craze"" right now in London. Who would've known? It's that California influence (and I'm proud that my ancestor's cuisine is appreciated in so many parts of the world). Having said that, the ingredients here are just not the same. The tortillas are rubbery and too thick...they are missing an ingredient and I'm not sure what it is. Their totopos (tortilla chips) are sometimes made with flour tortillas. Wha?!!! No...no...NO.Anyhow, having been to a few places searching for the Mexican spot where I will get my fix over the next 2-3 years while living in London, Lupita makes the list.Good things: Salsas served with the tacos are authentic and good. Tacos are a B-. Haven't tried the burritos. The tortilla soup is yummy. Good wine list. Cheap. The bad and the ugly: Very limited menu. Regular drinks (like a diet coke) are ridiculously overcharged (2.45 GBP for a diet coke -- for those not familiar with the current currency exchange rate, that's $3.19 for a small bottle of diet coke, no refills. Crazy town.). Tortillas used for the tacos are stiff. Rice is not authentic at all."	it s interesting   mexican food is  all the craze  right now in london  who would ve known  it s that california influence  and i m proud that my ancestor s cuisine is appreciated in so many parts of the world   having said that  the ingredients here are just not the same  the tortillas are rubbery and too thick   they are missing an ingredient and i m not sure what it is  their totopos  tortilla chips  are sometimes made with flour tortillas  wha     no   no   no anyhow  having been to a few places searching for the mexican spot where i will get my fix over the next 2 3 years while living in london  lupita makes the list good things  salsas served with the tacos are authentic and good  tacos are a b   haven t tried the burritos  the tortilla soup is yummy  good wine list  cheap  the bad and the ugly  very limited menu  regular drinks  like a diet coke  are ridiculously overcharged  2 45 gbp for a diet coke    for those not familiar with the current currency exchange rate  that s  3 19 for a small bottle of diet coke  no refills  crazy town    tortillas used for the tacos are stiff  rice is not authentic at all 
2130	5.0	A cool informal Mexican joint alongside Charing Cross Station just off the Strand and on a street corner, Lupita is easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled. Definitely more Mex than Tex Lupita has an air of authenticity serving up fresh, colourful and very tasty Mexican street food. The menu isn't huge but there are plenty of options for vegetarians. You can check the menu out online and also find the location of their other London branches, Shoreditch and Kensington I think. Our waiter was excellent and orders were relayed to the kitchen via ipad. Keeping with the electronic theme, each table had a device with a button which called the waiter and another button to request the bill. What a revelation! No hanging around once you've finished and want to get on with seeing London. Hurrah! Very convenient location even for those on the south side of the river as its alongside the pedestrian bridge. I'll be back!PS On Mondays to Fridays there's a lunch special. Watch out for Yelp check-in offers!	a cool informal mexican joint alongside charing cross station just off the strand and on a street corner  lupita is easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled  definitely more mex than tex lupita has an air of authenticity serving up fresh  colourful and very tasty mexican street food  the menu isn t huge but there are plenty of options for vegetarians  you can check the menu out online and also find the location of their other london branches  shoreditch and kensington i think  our waiter was excellent and orders were relayed to the kitchen via ipad  keeping with the electronic theme  each table had a device with a button which called the waiter and another button to request the bill  what a revelation  no hanging around once you ve finished and want to get on with seeing london  hurrah  very convenient location even for those on the south side of the river as its alongside the pedestrian bridge  i ll be back ps on mondays to fridays there s a lunch special  watch out for yelp check in offers

The chips came first and have to say I wasn't impressed at all with the guac. Did not taste authentic, tasted store bought. The tostadas took a long time to arrive but were tasty. Not sure I would go back.	came here weekday at night  it was busy but there were tables available  i was promptly seated and the waiter came quite quickly  ordered chips with guac and tuna tostadas  the chips came first and have to say i wasn t impressed at all with the guac  did not taste authentic  tasted store bought  the tostadas took a long time to arrive but were tasty  not sure i would go back

A full THIRTY minutes without even being offered a glass of water.

I had a team lunch and ordered their £9.99 lunch deal, including:1 main: 3 soft corn taco shells topped with cheese and chicken (spicy and filling!) 1 side dish: avocado saladQuite tasty and somehow lunch with a chill atmosphere, however the menu is rather small. If Lupita can add some regular mexican staples on the menu and up their starters game, they can really shine in the area!	lupica is a good alternative to wahaca in covent garden area  i had a team lunch and ordered their  9 99 lunch deal  including 1 main  3 soft corn taco shells topped with cheese and chicken  spicy and filling   1 side dish  avocado saladquite tasty and somehow lunch with a chill atmosphere  however the menu is rather small  if lupita can add some regular mexican staples on the menu and up their starters game  they can really shine in the area

2136	4.0	Upon leaving the States I thought I wouldn't have good Mexican food again until I returned. After all even Chipotle which I thought would be a godsend of comfort isn't quite the same here. My tastebuds were feeling ever so bored without spicy foods to tantalise them. Thankfully a friend recommended Lupita. The restaurant features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work. I sat around on a bar stool and noticed that homemade salsa had been placed at each seat. I had an order of the guacamole with chips and the tinga de pollo tacos. The guacamole portion felt rather small for the price but was full of flavour and all the right amounts of lime, onion and tomato. I personally prefer my corn chips as light as a feather so these ones were a bit dense and hard for me but nonetheless still tasty. The chips were a homemade and a good sized portion. As for the tacos? Pretty perfect! The meat was tender with quite a bit of heat paired with smokey chipotle sauce and a creamy avocado wedge. I also ordered a horchata which is a sweetened cinnamon rice milk. Thankfully they made it traditionally without dairy as many restaurants tend to cheat. It was a tad too sweet and I wished it was a little more cinnamon-y but I still enjoyed it. Will definitely be coming back here to satisfy my Mexican cravings.	upon leaving the states i thought i wouldn t have good mexican food again until i returned  after all even chipotle which i thought would be a godsend of comfort isn t quite the same here  my tastebuds were feeling ever so bored without spicy foods to tantalise them  thankfully a friend recommended lupita  the restaurant features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work  i sat around on a bar stool and noticed that homemade salsa had been placed at each seat  i had an order of the guacamole with chips and the tinga de pollo tacos  the guacamole portion felt rather small for the price but was full of flavour and all the right amounts of lime  onion and tomato  i personally prefer my corn chips as light as a feather so these ones were a bit dense and hard for me but nonetheless still tasty  the chips were a homemade and a good sized portion  as for the tacos  pretty perfect  the meat was tender with quite a bit of heat paired with smokey chipotle sauce and a creamy avocado wedge  i also ordered a horchata which is a sweetened cinnamon rice milk  thankfully they made it traditionally without dairy as many restaurants tend to cheat  it was a tad too sweet and i wished it was a little more cinnamon y but i still enjoyed it  will definitely be coming back here to satisfy my mexican cravings

It came out to be two SMALL tacos with small pieces of steak, one slice of avocado each and NOTHING ELSE!  When saw it i couldnt believe ive paidi nearly 2£ for not even a tb spoon of cheese and i sent it back saying i ordered with cheese! The chef looked super frustrated, threw aggressively the tacos , put the steak on the stone with some more cheese and prepare it super aggressively as ive had asked something too weird!  Anyway i just took it and left!

In London!  Sounds great! If only we knew....We were seated promptly, but then the staff seemed to forget we were there. We pressed the service disc on the table... no response. One more time, then someone came.  We placed our order.Some time passed (maybe 25 minutes), and we're getting hungry. We asked the server where our food was, and were told it'd be here shortly.  The place wasn't very busy.More time passed (at least another 10).  We asked again.  Again, ""It'll be here shortly.""Finally after a few more minutes, my wife decided we were done waiting and walked out with our son. I gathered the backpack and followed, which prompted a very quick response from the staff. They asked where we were going. I responded that we were tired of waiting, and that it should take around 40 minutes after ordering to get our food. I'm from California and go to a lot of Mexican restaurants, so I know whereof I speak. He told me our order was almost done. I told him that I'd heard that already a couple times and that this type of service was horrible. Quite a few other customers heard me.  After that, I headed out after my family.The only upside of going to Lupita's?  Since we didn't eat there, we did discover a nice little chain place nearby called Itsu.

We wanted some snack to take to the park and thought passed in front of this mexican which seemed a nice option for that day, it was indeed!Pretty close to the Victoria embankment park, we enjoyed our opened tortillas with their delish spicy sauces there, bought few drinks on the store next door which the waitress said would be much cheaper than buying there!I had a vegetarian opened tortilla with frijoles, avocados, onions and cream cheese, my partner had opened tuna and avocado tortillas! Both were really nice, huge portions considering that we just wanted a snack.	after just arriving in london we checked in our hotel and went for a walk to enjoy that beautiful sunny day  we wanted some snack to take to the park and thought passed in front of this mexican which seemed a nice option for that day  it was indeed pretty close to the victoria embankment park  we enjoyed our opened tortillas with their delish spicy sauces there  bought few drinks on the store next door which the waitress said would be much cheaper than buying there i had a vegetarian opened tortilla with frijoles  avocados  onions and cream cheese  my partner had opened tuna and avocado tortillas  both were really nice  huge portions considering that we just wanted a snack 
2140	4.0	We were wandering around, looking for someplace to eat, when we stumbled upon Lupita. We weren't sure what to expect, but we were actually kind of excited to try out a Mexican place in London. The food was good; the cheese crisp (Chicharron de Queso y Guacamole) we started with was sooo good: super cheesy and crispy! I had the Campechano tacos, and they were tasty; the mix of meats went together well. The normal salsa they give you isn't particularly spicy, so if you love spicy food, have them bring out the habenero salsa. It's spicy enough to bring a tear (or three) to your eye, but it actually adds a good flavor, too. My margarita was tasty, and our service was fast and friendly. We'd definitely eat there again next time we visit London.	we were wandering around  looking for someplace to eat  when we stumbled upon lupita  we weren t sure what to expect  but we were actually kind of excited to try out a mexican place in london  the food was good  the cheese crisp  chicharron de queso y guacamole  we started with was sooo good  super cheesy and crispy  i had the campechano tacos  and they were tasty  the mix of meats went together well  the normal salsa they give you isn t particularly spicy  so if you love spicy food  have them bring out the habenero salsa  it s spicy enough to bring a tear  or three  to your eye  but it actually adds a good flavor  too  my margarita was tasty  and our service was fast and friendly  we d definitely eat there again next time we visit london

You have buzzers on your table for calling the waiter, for cancelling, for requesting the bill. There is lot of seating space. Not just the floor you see from outside. There is more underneath. I went with a group, was pretty drunk I guess, took lots of pictures and had great fun buzzing the waitress. They were kind enough not to throw us out.	i had quite a lot from here  i m just trying to recollect the names  i should have written the review earlier  i remember the food was good  there were drinks too  the place is high tech  you have buzzers on your table for calling the waiter  for cancelling  for requesting the bill  there is lot of seating space  not just the floor you see from outside  there is more underneath  i went with a group  was pretty drunk i guess  took lots of pictures and had great fun buzzing the waitress  they were kind enough not to throw us out

2145	5.0	We were hungry and tipsy walking around Covent Garden in search of food at 11 pm on a Saturday, we hear some groovy Mexican music playing from this non pretentious place. We walk closer to see that it was a Mexican restaurant and completely packed even at that time of the night. I immediately check the yelp reviews and realize that I have come in the right place (more than 70 reviews and mostly 4 and 5 stars? You can't go wrong).A friendly, pretty Latina escorts us to a table near the window and hands us the menu (the quirkiest one I have seen). The menu was absolutely confusing because everything on it sounded delicious. I stuck with tacos and ordered a beef and cheese taco with guacamole (It was the best guacamole and tacos I have ever tasted). We also ordered for a Brazillian Spiced cocktail and I have to say that I have never tasted something like that before (It had tequila and some Brazilian liquor) because it was spicy, salty and sweet all at the same time! The music and the ambiance is an absolute winner, it immediately gets you in the fun and loud Mexican mood! I am not going to complain about the price and portion because the food and service was totally worth the amount we paid (It is not ridiculously expensive but definitely not as cheap as Bar Burrito). Verdict: If you want to try the best Mexican of your life then definitely try this place!	we were hungry and tipsy walking around covent garden in search of food at 11 pm on a saturday  we hear some groovy mexican music playing from this non pretentious place  we walk closer to see that it was a mexican restaurant and completely packed even at that time of the night  i immediately check the yelp reviews and realize that i have come in the right place  more than 70 reviews and mostly 4 and 5 stars  you can t go wrong  a friendly  pretty latina escorts us to a table near the window and hands us the menu  the quirkiest one i have seen   the menu was absolutely confusing because everything on it sounded delicious  i stuck with tacos and ordered a beef and cheese taco with guacamole  it was the best guacamole and tacos i have ever tasted   we also ordered for a brazillian spiced cocktail and i have to say that i have never tasted something like that before  it had tequila and some brazilian liquor  because it was spicy  salty and sweet all at the same time  the music and the ambiance is an absolute winner  it immediately gets you in the fun and loud mexican mood  i am not going to complain about the price and portion because the food and service was totally worth the amount we paid  it is not ridiculously expensive but definitely not as cheap as bar burrito   verdict  if you want to try the best mexican of your life then definitely try this place

It was ok, the steak burrito was nice and tender with salsa and sour cream on the side. It was about 10 pounds, which is reasonable. However, if you want to get tacos here, it's really expensive for the small tacos for around 7-8 pounds. It's very gourmet prepared which is the total opposite from the street tacos and taco trucks in San Diego."	i mean  you can never truly get  authentic  mexican food in britain if you re from california  i was craving a burrito and found this place  it was ok  the steak burrito was nice and tender with salsa and sour cream on the side  it was about 10 pounds  which is reasonable  however  if you want to get tacos here  it s really expensive for the small tacos for around 7 8 pounds  it s very gourmet prepared which is the total opposite from the street tacos and taco trucks in san diego

Everything was fresh, from the lettuce to the guacamole and the tortilla.  The waiter (his name escapes me) was also awesome.  He recommended a delicious margarita which was very good. I would recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a delicious Mexican restaurant.	delicious mexican food and great drinks   i had the carnitas burrito and it was outstanding  everything was fresh  from the lettuce to the guacamole and the tortilla   the waiter  his name escapes me  was also awesome   he recommended a delicious margarita which was very good  i would recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a delicious mexican restaurant 
2149	3.0	Great food but on our two most recent visits, the food delivery was really slow. We waited about 30 minutes and over 20 minutes, respectively. We also had errors with 2 of 4 food items on our latest visit. The staff apologized and removed one item from the bill. This good that they acknowledged the error. I noticed the waiters and cooks arguing quite loudly with one another.  The chef seemed to prepare the wrong item a few times.  We will definitely go back, but we will bring some patience next time.	great food but on our two most recent visits  the food delivery was really slow  we waited about 30 minutes and over 20 minutes  respectively  we also had errors with 2 of 4 food items on our latest visit  the staff apologized and removed one item from the bill  this good that they acknowledged the error  i noticed the waiters and cooks arguing quite loudly with one another   the chef seemed to prepare the wrong item a few times   we will definitely go back  but we will bring some patience next time

2152	4.0	A Mexican friend organized a night out here, claiming that Lupita served the most authentic Mexican food that he had found in London. He must have been right, because everyone in our group wiped our plates clean!Our meal started with a guacamole demo performed by a genial member of the staff. In my opinion, there are few things in the world better than fresh guac! Then we all ordered a round of cocktails. I ordered the ludwika paleta. I don't know what that means, but it must translate into yummy and refreshing strawberry cocktail.For the main course, I ordered a tuna tostada and tortilla chips served with half of an avocado stuffed with shrimp. I must have been eating with my eyes, because I couldn't finish both dishes! They were both delicious, though. My only complaint is that our waiter was a bit slow.While I am definitely a fan of Lupita, the prices are not budget-friendly. If I'm going to blow money fast for Mexican food, I might go to Wahaca instead because it has a bigger menu.	a mexican friend organized a night out here  claiming that lupita served the most authentic mexican food that he had found in london  he must have been right  because everyone in our group wiped our plates clean our meal started with a guacamole demo performed by a genial member of the staff  in my opinion  there are few things in the world better than fresh guac  then we all ordered a round of cocktails  i ordered the ludwika paleta  i don t know what that means  but it must translate into yummy and refreshing strawberry cocktail for the main course  i ordered a tuna tostada and tortilla chips served with half of an avocado stuffed with shrimp  i must have been eating with my eyes  because i couldn t finish both dishes  they were both delicious  though  my only complaint is that our waiter was a bit slow while i am definitely a fan of lupita  the prices are not budget friendly  if i m going to blow money fast for mexican food  i might go to wahaca instead because it has a bigger menu

When we brought this to Antonio's attention he fetched a dustpan and brush. Whether he intended to brain the mouse and then sweep it up or catch the critter and release it elsewhere we did not find out as it did a runner. Later either the same rodent or its cousin appeared and tried climbing up the face of the kitchen area. No action was taken, save a few worried faces from the staff. The food was OK ,however a 12.5% service charge seems a bit steep when they failed completely to deal with the mouse problem , which apparently is endemic ""due to it being an old building, near the River"". Let's hope the food preparation areas get a good clean each morning after the rodent revelries of the night before!

2155	3.0	After two weeks in Italy (basically only consuming pizza, spaghetti, wine and gelato), I needed something different. My dad and I stopped in here because it was open late and looked like a good spot. Unfortunately, the food was pretty mediocre and the portion sizes are very small (but in their defense, our waitress warned us about that and made sure we were still okay with eating there). I got a vegetable burrito and I liked that there was more than just the normal beans rice lettuce tomato etc. - it had grilled veggies that were still hot. I'm not sure exactly what kinds but it's much better than a normal vegetarian burrito. My dad got steak tacos and said they were so so. Basically, if you are really craving Mexican food, this place would give you that fix but it's not somewhere I would rush back to next time I'm in London.	after two weeks in italy  basically only consuming pizza  spaghetti  wine and gelato   i needed something different  my dad and i stopped in here because it was open late and looked like a good spot  unfortunately  the food was pretty mediocre and the portion sizes are very small  but in their defense  our waitress warned us about that and made sure we were still okay with eating there   i got a vegetable burrito and i liked that there was more than just the normal beans rice lettuce tomato etc    it had grilled veggies that were still hot  i m not sure exactly what kinds but it s much better than a normal vegetarian burrito  my dad got steak tacos and said they were so so  basically  if you are really craving mexican food  this place would give you that fix but it s not somewhere i would rush back to next time i m in london

In fact, you may want to search these reviews for a Californian if you're looking for an in-depth comparison analysis.However, I LOVE Mexican food. I've had it all around Mexico and California, so I know good Mexican when I taste it, even if I can't give an exact blow-by-blow of why.The mojito was amazing, and I am a mojito connoisseur. I ordered the shrimp tacos (Gobernador) with a side of Mexican rice. Everything was great, including our waitress. I will definitely be a regular here.	soooooo as a native new yorker  i know i m not exactly a mexican food expert  in fact  you may want to search these reviews for a californian if you re looking for an in depth comparison analysis however  i love mexican food  i ve had it all around mexico and california  so i know good mexican when i taste it  even if i can t give an exact blow by blow of why the mojito was amazing  and i am a mojito connoisseur  i ordered the shrimp tacos  gobernador  with a side of mexican rice  everything was great  including our waitress  i will definitely be a regular here

2159	4.0	For those of you not from the States, it's hard to understand how challenging it is to find GOOD Mexican food in the UK.  Trust me, we tried.Thus we were skeptical when on one of those blind ex-pat dates (i.e. meeting friends of friends who just happen to also live in London and obviously we should get along with), they took us to Lupita claiming that the food was pretty good.Our opinion rapidly changed once we ate our meals.  The tacos are amazing!  Delicious, savoury meat with just the right toppings to accent the flavours.  On another occasion I  tried the enchiladas and they were creamy and ooey-gooey.  My husband always orders the carnitas burrito with the spicy chipotle mayo sauce on top.Unfortunately, the chips are too thick and hurt my teeth to eat, so that would be the only downside to the food.  However, we keep ordering them anyway, because it's impossible to eat Mexican food without chips!For the most part, I think the prices are reasonable.  However, I wouldn't order the table side guacamole because I think £10.95 for guac is a travesty!  The staff are friendly and the service is attentive, but not overly so.  They give you an awesome piece of technology with buttons to call the waiter/waitress or to ask for the check.It can take awhile to get in with a big group, but with just two of us, we have never had a problem.My hubby's been craving Lupita, so I'm pretty sure we'll be spotted there soon...	for those of you not from the states  it s hard to understand how challenging it is to find good mexican food in the uk   trust me  we tried thus we were skeptical when on one of those blind ex pat dates  i e  meeting friends of friends who just happen to also live in london and obviously we should get along with   they took us to lupita claiming that the food was pretty good our opinion rapidly changed once we ate our meals   the tacos are amazing   delicious  savoury meat with just the right toppings to accent the flavours   on another occasion i  tried the enchiladas and they were creamy and ooey gooey   my husband always orders the carnitas burrito with the spicy chipotle mayo sauce on top unfortunately  the chips are too thick and hurt my teeth to eat  so that would be the only downside to the food   however  we keep ordering them anyway  because it s impossible to eat mexican food without chips for the most part  i think the prices are reasonable   however  i wouldn t order the table side guacamole because i think  10 95 for guac is a travesty   the staff are friendly and the service is attentive  but not overly so   they give you an awesome piece of technology with buttons to call the waiter waitress or to ask for the check it can take awhile to get in with a big group  but with just two of us  we have never had a problem my hubby s been craving lupita  so i m pretty sure we ll be spotted there soon

While lightyears better than, say, Wahaca (doesn't take much, really), it's still a far cry from the Mexican-Mexican food I so much crave in London.The table-side guacamole is good, but obscenely expensive, and the rest of the food is a bit underwhelming and similarly priced.

2161	2.0	It was OK but not sure I would return.The tortilla chips were hard and not fresh as I was expecting and the portion a little mean. Guac was meh. My carnitas burrito (filling: pork, rice, cheese) was weirdly dense. Had to work at it with a knife and fork and was a tad greasy. Not that big and just came on a plate with no accompaniments (sides have to be purchased extra) and for the price, I wish I had just gone to Chipotle up the road. I suppose it's a style thing. Maybe the food here is more Mexican style, based on my one visit to Mexico City, as opposed to Tex- Mex or Cal-Mex which I prefer.	it was ok but not sure i would return the tortilla chips were hard and not fresh as i was expecting and the portion a little mean  guac was meh  my carnitas burrito  filling  pork  rice  cheese  was weirdly dense  had to work at it with a knife and fork and was a tad greasy  not that big and just came on a plate with no accompaniments  sides have to be purchased extra  and for the price  i wish i had just gone to chipotle up the road  i suppose it s a style thing  maybe the food here is more mexican style  based on my one visit to mexico city  as opposed to tex  mex or cal mex which i prefer 
2162	2.0	Le sigh.Lupita presents Mexican street food -- tacos, tortas -- in a slicked up modern environment. The place is full, so they're clearly hitting a high note for their guests.The good news: the salsas are pretty tasty, especially the green one and the menu ranges far and wide, featuring Mexican insider delicacies like cochinita pibil, tinga de pollo and huitlacoche. As well, you'll hear a lot of Spanish spoken among the staff in the restaurant.The bad news is that the Spanish is spoken by Spaniards not Mexicans and the food follows suit. Where to begin?- Canned jalapenos- Table salt rimmed margaritas- Cheap chips woefully lacking in flavour, that break too easily and are definitely not freshly fried- Similarly bad tortillas (probably produced in the same factory)Advice (so as to end this review on a high note): Do get the al pastor tacos and look past the tortila and the strange British tasting pork and you'll enjoy wonderfully spiced, authentic al pastor flavours.	le sigh lupita presents mexican street food    tacos  tortas    in a slicked up modern environment  the place is full  so they re clearly hitting a high note for their guests the good news  the salsas are pretty tasty  especially the green one and the menu ranges far and wide  featuring mexican insider delicacies like cochinita pibil  tinga de pollo and huitlacoche  as well  you ll hear a lot of spanish spoken among the staff in the restaurant the bad news is that the spanish is spoken by spaniards not mexicans and the food follows suit  where to begin   canned jalapenos  table salt rimmed margaritas  cheap chips woefully lacking in flavour  that break too easily and are definitely not freshly fried  similarly bad tortillas  probably produced in the same factory advice  so as to end this review on a high note   do get the al pastor tacos and look past the tortila and the strange british tasting pork and you ll enjoy wonderfully spiced  authentic al pastor flavours 
2163	3.0	First time I went to Lupita my friend vetoed shrimp tacos so we went with a few things I wouldn't have ordered and then a few slightly experimental dishes I suggested. Cactus quesadillas were interesting and I found the huitlacoche (truffle) quesadilla just not to my personal taste (I'm not a huge mushroom fan in general). The arrachera and pastor tacos were both pretty tasty but again wouldn't have been my first choice. So I resolved to go back and make better decisions!Second time I got to order the tacos gobernador (shrimp) and they were delicious. I would definitely recommend them and get them again. My friend also really enjoyed the cochinta pibil.Service is a little uneven - sometimes you are left sitting for a long time (although I had my back to the restaurant so couldn't catch anyone's eye easily). However, the food seems to come quickly once ordered and servers are responsive if you flag them down. It's always busy but you are not rushed at all.	first time i went to lupita my friend vetoed shrimp tacos so we went with a few things i wouldn t have ordered and then a few slightly experimental dishes i suggested  cactus quesadillas were interesting and i found the huitlacoche  truffle  quesadilla just not to my personal taste  i m not a huge mushroom fan in general   the arrachera and pastor tacos were both pretty tasty but again wouldn t have been my first choice  so i resolved to go back and make better decisions second time i got to order the tacos gobernador  shrimp  and they were delicious  i would definitely recommend them and get them again  my friend also really enjoyed the cochinta pibil service is a little uneven   sometimes you are left sitting for a long time  although i had my back to the restaurant so couldn t catch anyone s eye easily   however  the food seems to come quickly once ordered and servers are responsive if you flag them down  it s always busy but you are not rushed at all

2165	2.0	I've been here a few times, usually spontaneously dropping in when in the area.  I think perhaps it's hit its inevitable decline?  The first time my dinner companions and I were treated to a good meal, with the bonus of the table-side guacamole preparation, where they bring the avocados and other ingredients, and cut and mash everything there for you - very fresh, and a nice touch, kind of like when they flambe' a dish at your table at fancier restaurants.  I recently returned for a quick bite between lunch and dinner, and this time the guacamole was downright bad.  I think they used old lemon juice to try and extend the life of it, and it wasn't working - just because they stemmed the transformation from green to brown, they couldn't hide the decline in taste, nor the fact that it was more than a few hours (days?) old.  Also, the tortilla chips were hard, dense, and oily.  As for my meal, the tacos were pretty marginal, and again the tortillas used were sub-par.I also had the misfortune of using the bathroom downstairs.  It stunk due to there being no proper ventilation.  I'm usually not that skittish, but I almost puked when I was in there in the warm and humid stinky environment.  It was all I could do to wash my hands quickly and leave.  This loo experience may be OK for a dive bar, but not a restaurant!	i ve been here a few times  usually spontaneously dropping in when in the area   i think perhaps it s hit its inevitable decline   the first time my dinner companions and i were treated to a good meal  with the bonus of the table side guacamole preparation  where they bring the avocados and other ingredients  and cut and mash everything there for you   very fresh  and a nice touch  kind of like when they flambe  a dish at your table at fancier restaurants   i recently returned for a quick bite between lunch and dinner  and this time the guacamole was downright bad   i think they used old lemon juice to try and extend the life of it  and it wasn t working   just because they stemmed the transformation from green to brown  they couldn t hide the decline in taste  nor the fact that it was more than a few hours  days   old   also  the tortilla chips were hard  dense  and oily   as for my meal  the tacos were pretty marginal  and again the tortillas used were sub par i also had the misfortune of using the bathroom downstairs   it stunk due to there being no proper ventilation   i m usually not that skittish  but i almost puked when i was in there in the warm and humid stinky environment   it was all i could do to wash my hands quickly and leave   this loo experience may be ok for a dive bar  but not a restaurant

2168	2.0	Oh Lupita, I had high hopes for you, but alas, you failed me. On my never-ending quest to get Mexican in London, we tried out Lupita. It smelled good coming in and the menu looked great.We ordered the premium margaritas. Which were better than most places, but the balance of flavor was a bit off. They were a tad too sweet, which is strange given the ingredients. It didn't stop us from finishing the pitcher though.For starters we got guacamole and what I thought was going to be nachos, but was just beans, meat, guacamole and a bit of cheese on top of chips. Unfortunately, neither of them was really outstanding. The guacamole was bland. Which is impressive because I make it at home and I can't understand how it can turn out so bland. In fact, my guacamole was ridiculously better than the stuff made here. The nacho-like dish was alright, but also a bit bland. Salt. The key to Mexican is salt. Beans need salt. Avocados need salt. Unfortunately, the lack of salt in the dishes was severely obvious.For mains I had lengua (beef tongue) tacos. The tongue was really chewy. The menu claimed it would be slow cooked, but I don't really think it was. Nava ordered beans with chorizo as a side, and again bland. I ordered the side of chiles because I thought it might spice things up a bit. The waitress warned me they were really really really really really really really hot. And they were. The chiles were the best thing there. Adding them to my tacos (and basically everything else on the table) really made everything better. Which is disappointing because they should be able to get the spice levels right.When the waitress asked me what I thought of the chiles (and by this time I was loving them and my face was read and tears were slowly dripping out of my eyes), I flat out told her that they were amazing, but I had to add them to my food to make it better because everything seemed a bit bland otherwise. She agreed. That's not a good sign. When the waitress tells you that everything would be spicier if it were in Mexico, but they cut back because of the British palate, you know there's a problem.It just didn't do it for me unfortunately, and won't be coming back here any time soon.	oh lupita  i had high hopes for you  but alas  you failed me  on my never ending quest to get mexican in london  we tried out lupita  it smelled good coming in and the menu looked great we ordered the premium margaritas  which were better than most places  but the balance of flavor was a bit off  they were a tad too sweet  which is strange given the ingredients  it didn t stop us from finishing the pitcher though for starters we got guacamole and what i thought was going to be nachos  but was just beans  meat  guacamole and a bit of cheese on top of chips  unfortunately  neither of them was really outstanding  the guacamole was bland  which is impressive because i make it at home and i can t understand how it can turn out so bland  in fact  my guacamole was ridiculously better than the stuff made here  the nacho like dish was alright  but also a bit bland  salt  the key to mexican is salt  beans need salt  avocados need salt  unfortunately  the lack of salt in the dishes was severely obvious for mains i had lengua  beef tongue  tacos  the tongue was really chewy  the menu claimed it would be slow cooked  but i don t really think it was  nava ordered beans with chorizo as a side  and again bland  i ordered the side of chiles because i thought it might spice things up a bit  the waitress warned me they were really really really really really really really hot  and they were  the chiles were the best thing there  adding them to my tacos  and basically everything else on the table  really made everything better  which is disappointing because they should be able to get the spice levels right when the waitress asked me what i thought of the chiles  and by this time i was loving them and my face was read and tears were slowly dripping out of my eyes   i flat out told her that they were amazing  but i had to add them to my food to make it better because everything seemed a bit bland otherwise  she agreed  that s not a good sign  when the waitress tells you that everything would be spicier if it were in mexico  but they cut back because of the british palate  you know there s a problem it just didn t do it for me unfortunately  and won t be coming back here any time soon

The prices are quite reasonable.I'd recommend the pork tacos.

2171	1.0	Went here for a meal after being told it was amazing Mexican food. If you like horrible service, food made hours in advance for a great cost this is your place. We sat down for a meal and everyone else around us seem to have waiters taking their orders. But even with the numerous times we pressed the waiters button we seemed to watch everyone get their food. After getting up to ask someone to take our order it still took them 5 minutes to come and ask us what we would like.We got guacamole that was made in front of us but we were that hungry the tortilla chips were gone before he was done making it. The under seasoned dish wasnt worth the 11 pounds. The rest of the food was similar not seasoned or worse over cooked and unsatisfactory. The restaurant is a open kitchen like you would see in a sushi bar. So as a chef myself I took a peek from the bar seating. And the preparations were a mess and looked to have been in a clear violation of health safety. Food poisoning breading ground only wish I noticed this before I had ordered and ate. Wouldn't trust this over priced restaurant to serve me or anyone else. I'd be horrified if I owned this establishment and ashamed to say I chef here.PLEASE BE WARNED: SPEND YOUR HARD EARN MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!	went here for a meal after being told it was amazing mexican food  if you like horrible service  food made hours in advance for a great cost this is your place  we sat down for a meal and everyone else around us seem to have waiters taking their orders  but even with the numerous times we pressed the waiters button we seemed to watch everyone get their food  after getting up to ask someone to take our order it still took them 5 minutes to come and ask us what we would like we got guacamole that was made in front of us but we were that hungry the tortilla chips were gone before he was done making it  the under seasoned dish wasnt worth the 11 pounds  the rest of the food was similar not seasoned or worse over cooked and unsatisfactory  the restaurant is a open kitchen like you would see in a sushi bar  so as a chef myself i took a peek from the bar seating  and the preparations were a mess and looked to have been in a clear violation of health safety  food poisoning breading ground only wish i noticed this before i had ordered and ate  wouldn t trust this over priced restaurant to serve me or anyone else  i d be horrified if i owned this establishment and ashamed to say i chef here please be warned  spend your hard earn money somewhere else 
2172	2.0	Went there last night for a birthday dinner, the birthday boy wanted to have some authentic Mexican dishes, so we went. The place was nice and cozy, staff were friendly and helpful. It's even better if you speak Spanish.We ordered quite a bit of everything, I don't remember most of the names, sorry. But all I remember was the smallest tacos I ever seen in my life (which were not much bigger than my palm), the taste was ok, but the tacos were soaked with liquid (from the union and tomato?). The tortilla chips were a bit hard for me, my friend kept adding salt to the fresh avocado dip to make a better flavour. I don't know... The drink was good though. Will have to think twice if I will go again, not sure right now...	went there last night for a birthday dinner  the birthday boy wanted to have some authentic mexican dishes  so we went  the place was nice and cozy  staff were friendly and helpful  it s even better if you speak spanish we ordered quite a bit of everything  i don t remember most of the names  sorry  but all i remember was the smallest tacos i ever seen in my life  which were not much bigger than my palm   the taste was ok  but the tacos were soaked with liquid  from the union and tomato    the tortilla chips were a bit hard for me  my friend kept adding salt to the fresh avocado dip to make a better flavour  i don t know    the drink was good though  will have to think twice if i will go again  not sure right now

I did go in skeptical as I am from Texas and have been to Mexico frequently. Very convenient to the tube. This place wasn't terrible though. Portion sizes are small for the prices compared to ""authentic,"" but not too bad for central London. Service was okay. Did not satisfy the mexican craving that I'd been yearning to satiate, but it was decent."	while on a holiday in london  a friend that works nearby wanted to try this place and coerced me into accompanying her  i did go in skeptical as i am from texas and have been to mexico frequently  very convenient to the tube  this place wasn t terrible though  portion sizes are small for the prices compared to  authentic   but not too bad for central london  service was okay  did not satisfy the mexican craving that i d been yearning to satiate  but it was decent

I should blame her for hyping it up probably.We went to the Embankment branch, for a friend's surprise bday and the staff were nice, the beers cold, and music good.Hmm..so what was my problem...Oh yeah, I found the food a little bland unfortunately; I had a burrito which Im pretty sure should be served in foil, otherwise what happens/happened is that the whole thing falls apart. I tried a few things that others' had ordered (a habit I have picked up from Mrs K) and they weren't that much better. At the risk of sounding like more of a (s)nob than I undoubtedly already do, having been to Mexico and lived in SoCal, I was expecting the food to be a lot better.I must say though that the Guac they gave us with the tortilla chips at the start was amazing!	my wife raved abuot this place last time she was at the shoreditch branch so i really wanted to love it  but alas i did not  i should blame her for hyping it up probably we went to the embankment branch  for a friend s surprise bday and the staff were nice  the beers cold  and music good hmm  so what was my problem   oh yeah  i found the food a little bland unfortunately  i had a burrito which im pretty sure should be served in foil  otherwise what happens happened is that the whole thing falls apart  i tried a few things that others  had ordered  a habit i have picked up from mrs k  and they weren t that much better  at the risk of sounding like more of a  s nob than i undoubtedly already do  having been to mexico and lived in socal  i was expecting the food to be a lot better i must say though that the guac they gave us with the tortilla chips at the start was amazing 
2175	1.0	"The food was good but did not do justice for the way my friends and I were treated this evening and I will never go back.It was my friend's birthday. She was thrilled to find out there was one here being that there is also one in San Francisco, her home town. We had to wait a few minutes which was not a problem so we asked if we could order a pitcher of margarita. They were fine with it and put it in for us. Obviously, they forget being we waited nearly 20 minutes for it.It took about that much time as well to get the waiter, Javier's attention to place our order. Three of us ordered the enchilada verde which he messed up and gave my friend, the birthday girl, the wrong meal. It took a good 20 minutes to get the bill. We would call a waiter over and rudely tell us that ""they could not help us"".  Finally Javier comes over and still has the wrong meal on the cheque. He goes ahead and fixes it. Then comes back 10-15 minutes later with the other cheque.Another waiter was so friendly and came over and helped us being Javier was nowhere to be found.  We pay what we had to pay and got ready to leave. Javier runs over accusing us of not paying the bill. We told him we did and left.  Javier followed us outside down the street yelling at us telling us we did not pay when we did. We just walked off and he told us to ""F*** off"". Now really, is that how a waiter should behave? Never going back. Ever. As long as Javier is working there.Oh yes, and Javier asked us if we were going to pay the service charge.

2176	4.0	Having not seen my friend for two years as she'd been travelling around Mexico, I racked my brain for where to take her. I'd have never had guessed her first suggestion would have been a Mexican restaurant.But she raved about it, saying they flew the avocados straight over from Mexico and there was mention of deep fried cheese. Basically, I was sold pretty quickly. Also, it's always nice to go somewhere with a semi-expert. This teeny tiny bar was jam packed on the Thursday we went in. But the staff were happy and friendly enough and said we could have a drink from the bar and a menu while we waited. We were quickly sat at the bar, where you can see everything being made by the chefs. Not the best place to sit when you're a tad peckish, but a great view otherwise. We shared some fried cheese and guacamole and I ate a delicious Tuna Taco. I must admit, I came away a tad hungry and a little more skint than I'd hoped (the Corona's were a little on the expensive side) but everything else from the food to the view to the waitress were top notch.Would love to go again.	having not seen my friend for two years as she d been travelling around mexico  i racked my brain for where to take her  i d have never had guessed her first suggestion would have been a mexican restaurant but she raved about it  saying they flew the avocados straight over from mexico and there was mention of deep fried cheese  basically  i was sold pretty quickly  also  it s always nice to go somewhere with a semi expert  this teeny tiny bar was jam packed on the thursday we went in  but the staff were happy and friendly enough and said we could have a drink from the bar and a menu while we waited  we were quickly sat at the bar  where you can see everything being made by the chefs  not the best place to sit when you re a tad peckish  but a great view otherwise  we shared some fried cheese and guacamole and i ate a delicious tuna taco  i must admit  i came away a tad hungry and a little more skint than i d hoped  the corona s were a little on the expensive side  but everything else from the food to the view to the waitress were top notch would love to go again

They left me and my boyfriend very unsatisfied. Literally everything had NO FLAVOR. ""Mexican Rice"" was white, chips had no salt, the carne asada wasn't marinated & lacked flavor, and the enchiladas a complete joke. How can you mess up enchiladas? Simple, they made them into a wet taco! We were surprised on how quick the meal came out, but were left waiting for over 10 minutes after our waitress cleared our table and we asked for the check. We had to flag her down to get the check (even though we already asked for it) and then flag her down with our card.

Slow, inattentive and they missed several simple things on my order.Portion size is rather small for the price. Overall, I was disappointed and might go back if I can't find better Mexican food in London. For the meantime, I'm on the hunt for that better option.	i ll start out with the positives  the food is flavorful and the options on the menu are pretty good however  the service is very poor  slow  inattentive and they missed several simple things on my order portion size is rather small for the price  overall  i was disappointed and might go back if i can t find better mexican food in london  for the meantime  i m on the hunt for that better option 
2181	4.0	It's always interesting reviewing a place that my hubby has beat me to. I'd just like to clarify that I didn't rave about Lupita before - just their guac! Which he rightly notes is pretty awesome and super fresh. I also tried the deep fried cheese this time, which while *wrong*, is also very moreish. It's kinda like the crunchy bits you get of cheese on the side of a baked pasta dish. I had to move the item further down the table so that I didn't keep nibbling on it. I think I'd probs order it again though ;)Lupita tries hard but I really think there are only a couple of things on the menu that work. The enchiladas I tried this time were delish! Super calorific but good for an occasional treat :D	it s always interesting reviewing a place that my hubby has beat me to  i d just like to clarify that i didn t rave about lupita before   just their guac  which he rightly notes is pretty awesome and super fresh  i also tried the deep fried cheese this time  which while  wrong   is also very moreish  it s kinda like the crunchy bits you get of cheese on the side of a baked pasta dish  i had to move the item further down the table so that i didn t keep nibbling on it  i think i d probs order it again though   lupita tries hard but i really think there are only a couple of things on the menu that work  the enchiladas i tried this time were delish  super calorific but good for an occasional treat  d
2182	4.0	Where I grew up Mexican food is not known to be expensive or too commercialized.Hence my conflict with Lupita.Everything on the menu tastes great, from the tacos on through to the tortilla soup.  But having its roots in La Cuidad, I held out hope that it would feature more Mexican-esque options such a cabeza (beef head meat), lengua (beef tongue) and perhaps even menudo (innards).Not at all disappointed.  Worth noting that dishes are bite sized and the prices not so much.	where i grew up mexican food is not known to be expensive or too commercialized hence my conflict with lupita everything on the menu tastes great  from the tacos on through to the tortilla soup   but having its roots in la cuidad  i held out hope that it would feature more mexican esque options such a cabeza  beef head meat   lengua  beef tongue  and perhaps even menudo  innards  not at all disappointed   worth noting that dishes are bite sized and the prices not so much 
2183	4.0	In a city where most everyone complains about the lack of authentic Mexican food, Lupita will certainly please.  For a restaurant that is not perfect, it does a nearly perfect job at satisfying a craving. The flavors of good Mexico City food are all there. Tacos were zesty, authentic and fresh.  My fellow diners also had quesadillas and boasted its ability to reach comfort food status.  I'm looking forward to trying one of their pulled-pork specials next time.  Menu also offers seafood.Portions are not huge but you will also not walk away hungry for a reasonable price.Atmosphere felt a bit impersonal, like that of a chain.  (Caveat: I went over the lunch hour so the restaurant was filled with business patrons.)  Service was pleasantly cherry. The service call buttons at each table are genius.  Adds to the chain feel but this allowed the wait staff to be available without being intrusive.   The most hard core of critics may note that the guacamole could use a little more zing and some ingredients could be a little more authentic.  I personally wouldn't have minded a spicier salsa, but overall, my meal was delicious and I'll happily take anyone who has given up on Mexican food in London.	in a city where most everyone complains about the lack of authentic mexican food  lupita will certainly please   for a restaurant that is not perfect  it does a nearly perfect job at satisfying a craving  the flavors of good mexico city food are all there  tacos were zesty  authentic and fresh   my fellow diners also had quesadillas and boasted its ability to reach comfort food status   i m looking forward to trying one of their pulled pork specials next time   menu also offers seafood portions are not huge but you will also not walk away hungry for a reasonable price atmosphere felt a bit impersonal  like that of a chain    caveat  i went over the lunch hour so the restaurant was filled with business patrons    service was pleasantly cherry  the service call buttons at each table are genius   adds to the chain feel but this allowed the wait staff to be available without being intrusive    the most hard core of critics may note that the guacamole could use a little more zing and some ingredients could be a little more authentic   i personally wouldn t have minded a spicier salsa  but overall  my meal was delicious and i ll happily take anyone who has given up on mexican food in london 
2184	2.0	Lupita is one of those places that's popular because its trendy. It also happens to be in a street with such high footfall that it would be impossible for it to fail no matter how bad it was.But in my book that's no excuse for serving mediocre food and I attentive service.While I appreciate that the guacamole is made fresh in front of you, there's no point in having it because its the most tasteless, bland guacamole I've ever had. Even the stuff you can get in jars in the supermarket tastes better.It's a shame really because I was hoping Lupita would be so much better than it was.It's pricey too. If you want pricey street food, make the short walk to Wahaca where you'll at least get decent food and service for your money...The one saving grace is the Agua de Jamaica is really good here, and they use all the authentic names for the dishes and such.	lupita is one of those places that s popular because its trendy  it also happens to be in a street with such high footfall that it would be impossible for it to fail no matter how bad it was but in my book that s no excuse for serving mediocre food and i attentive service while i appreciate that the guacamole is made fresh in front of you  there s no point in having it because its the most tasteless  bland guacamole i ve ever had  even the stuff you can get in jars in the supermarket tastes better it s a shame really because i was hoping lupita would be so much better than it was it s pricey too  if you want pricey street food  make the short walk to wahaca where you ll at least get decent food and service for your money   the one saving grace is the agua de jamaica is really good here  and they use all the authentic names for the dishes and such 
2185	4.0	Being from Los Angeles, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food...and London has disappointed me before in this category. So much so, that I originally wrote off my coworker's recommendation of Lupita.Despite my original snobbery, I stumbled upon Lupita one night soon after making the big move to London. The timing couldn't have been better because I was at the peak of homesickness for LA. The food immediately transported me back. The tortas, tacos, and burritos are just like you'd find in those small taco shops tucked all over Los Angeles that are packed with locals. The salsa is spicy and the meat is very well flavored (I prefer the al pastor). Although the food was a portal back to my local taco shop, Lupita is going for the restaurant feel. Tableside guacamole preparation is a good example of how they are far from fast food. The prices are also quite a bit higher than one would expect to pay at a taco shop...even without converting £ to $. The price (£15-20/person) can be justified because they get many of their ingredients straight from Mexico.In any case, it is the best Mexican food that I've had after my time so far in London. The service is also stellar. Ken, the owner, is from San Francisco and takes a lot of pride in sharing Lupita's food with customers.  He gave me some samples and even recommended other restaurants in the area that I need to visit. I'll definitely be going back whenever I need a taste of home.	being from los angeles  i have pretty high standards for mexican food   and london has disappointed me before in this category  so much so  that i originally wrote off my coworker s recommendation of lupita despite my original snobbery  i stumbled upon lupita one night soon after making the big move to london  the timing couldn t have been better because i was at the peak of homesickness for la  the food immediately transported me back  the tortas  tacos  and burritos are just like you d find in those small taco shops tucked all over los angeles that are packed with locals  the salsa is spicy and the meat is very well flavored  i prefer the al pastor   although the food was a portal back to my local taco shop  lupita is going for the restaurant feel  tableside guacamole preparation is a good example of how they are far from fast food  the prices are also quite a bit higher than one would expect to pay at a taco shop   even without converting   to    the price   15 20 person  can be justified because they get many of their ingredients straight from mexico in any case  it is the best mexican food that i ve had after my time so far in london  the service is also stellar  ken  the owner  is from san francisco and takes a lot of pride in sharing lupita s food with customers   he gave me some samples and even recommended other restaurants in the area that i need to visit  i ll definitely be going back whenever i need a taste of home 
2186	4.0	Lupita is a gem. In the ongoing quest to find spots for Tequila Tuesday, Lupita came up early: in fact, it was one of the first. Friends and I also celebrated TT#8 at the new Lupita near Brick Lane, and both times, I was undeniably pleased with every aspect of my experience.The food is absolutely amazing, and the cochinita pibil perfectly captures exactly what slow-cooked pork is supposed to be--taking the time to make such a vital component of the Mexican taco menu properly is definitely a highlight.There are lots of options for drinks, and I was pleased to try a new one at the new Lupita opening: the ingredients are a bit fuzzy in my memory (I blame the drink), but I remember it had brown sugar, and perfectly complimented a delicious cheese and chorizo fundito. Their pico de gallo is spicy and fresh, as is the guacamole.The prices at Lupita are standard for London, and it's not unusual to spend £20 without realizing it. However, the service is attentive, and the manager who served my friends and I during our first visit remembered us at our second, despite the new location. It's nice, in a city so big, to be well fed and well cared for in such a way.	lupita is a gem  in the ongoing quest to find spots for tequila tuesday  lupita came up early  in fact  it was one of the first  friends and i also celebrated tt 8 at the new lupita near brick lane  and both times  i was undeniably pleased with every aspect of my experience the food is absolutely amazing  and the cochinita pibil perfectly captures exactly what slow cooked pork is supposed to be  taking the time to make such a vital component of the mexican taco menu properly is definitely a highlight there are lots of options for drinks  and i was pleased to try a new one at the new lupita opening  the ingredients are a bit fuzzy in my memory  i blame the drink   but i remember it had brown sugar  and perfectly complimented a delicious cheese and chorizo fundito  their pico de gallo is spicy and fresh  as is the guacamole the prices at lupita are standard for london  and it s not unusual to spend  20 without realizing it  however  the service is attentive  and the manager who served my friends and i during our first visit remembered us at our second  despite the new location  it s nice  in a city so big  to be well fed and well cared for in such a way

Go during the off hours to not have to wait around.	as for lupita  this was a big shocker to find mexican in london to find mexican and have it be great was the biggest shocker definitely the al pastor was hands down authentic and tasty the conchinita was really great as well the service is friendly and the place gets packed at night  go during the off hours to not have to wait around 
2188	2.0	First time here was about 4 years ago, and it was fabulous.  I've now been back maybe 8 to 10 times ... and the quality has descended downward in pretty linear fashion ever since, culminating in last night's debacle which left me so dissatisfied that I mustered up the energy to scrawl out this review.My favourite dish on the menu has, to this point, been the Gringa -- pork tacos with pineapple and other fixins.  But the meat has become more and more dry, the fixins less and less satisfying, and I think I'll stay away from it from now on.  Other dishes (the Gobernador tacos (spicy shrimp), chicken tinga, etc.) left much to be desired as well.  Not particularly spicy, not particularly juicy, just kind of ... meh.Not to mention their mezcal margaritas are, like 12 GBP, from which you can maybe extract two or three sips before hitting nothing but rocks, and ... well ... no thanks.  I'm saying goodbye once and for all, Lupita.  It was good while it lasted.	first time here was about 4 years ago  and it was fabulous   i ve now been back maybe 8 to 10 times     and the quality has descended downward in pretty linear fashion ever since  culminating in last night s debacle which left me so dissatisfied that i mustered up the energy to scrawl out this review my favourite dish on the menu has  to this point  been the gringa    pork tacos with pineapple and other fixins   but the meat has become more and more dry  the fixins less and less satisfying  and i think i ll stay away from it from now on   other dishes  the gobernador tacos  spicy shrimp   chicken tinga  etc   left much to be desired as well   not particularly spicy  not particularly juicy  just kind of     meh not to mention their mezcal margaritas are  like 12 gbp  from which you can maybe extract two or three sips before hitting nothing but rocks  and     well     no thanks   i m saying goodbye once and for all  lupita   it was good while it lasted

2190	4.0	I've just moved to London and having fun exploring all the new eating options which have opened up for me. Lupita is on the street I work on, and since I am a massive margarita fan, my boyfriend and I decided to try this out after work one night. The guy who was looking after us was probably the owner, as he seemed really invested in the restaurant, taking his time to explain the menu and how much we should order. His customer service skills were excellent, and he was a credit to the restaurant. We ordered nachos, one taco, one quesadilla and one speciality fish dish to share. all were really really good - most especially the mushroom quesadilla and the classic nachos.My margarita was fantastic! I often think the UK finds it difficult to replicate the margaritas that can be found in America, especially in the south, but they really did a good job on mine. The only negative that I would have about this experience is that when we ordered, the guy told us that it was fiesta hour, and that the cocktails had money off. I asked if this included the margarita and he confirmed that it did. When we received the bill, the margarita was normal priced. We were in a hurry, and because the food and the service had both been very good, we didn't correct this, however, if I were to go to Lupita again and the same thing were to happen, I'd definitely knock off a star and be slightly hesitant to return. I will be giving it a second try, and hope that my second visit will be just as memorable...and will include a fiesta hour margarita at the fiesta hour prices :)	i ve just moved to london and having fun exploring all the new eating options which have opened up for me  lupita is on the street i work on  and since i am a massive margarita fan  my boyfriend and i decided to try this out after work one night  the guy who was looking after us was probably the owner  as he seemed really invested in the restaurant  taking his time to explain the menu and how much we should order  his customer service skills were excellent  and he was a credit to the restaurant  we ordered nachos  one taco  one quesadilla and one speciality fish dish to share  all were really really good   most especially the mushroom quesadilla and the classic nachos my margarita was fantastic  i often think the uk finds it difficult to replicate the margaritas that can be found in america  especially in the south  but they really did a good job on mine  the only negative that i would have about this experience is that when we ordered  the guy told us that it was fiesta hour  and that the cocktails had money off  i asked if this included the margarita and he confirmed that it did  when we received the bill  the margarita was normal priced  we were in a hurry  and because the food and the service had both been very good  we didn t correct this  however  if i were to go to lupita again and the same thing were to happen  i d definitely knock off a star and be slightly hesitant to return  i will be giving it a second try  and hope that my second visit will be just as memorable   and will include a fiesta hour margarita at the fiesta hour prices   
2191	4.0	It is nice to have a beyond-burritos place to sit down, have some affordable Mexican, and sip on some margaritas.  I like that there is a very authentic Mexican menu--everything from nopales and tortilla soup to chiliquiles.  We stuck to tacos and they are served up Mexican style--no sides, no toppings, just meat in a tortilla so order plenty of sides.Didn't love the nachos, although i prefer American-style nachos.  You can eat a lot of different dishes for cheap and samples lots of different Mexican specialties, thus the high rating.I do prefer the Churros at Wahaca though.	it is nice to have a beyond burritos place to sit down  have some affordable mexican  and sip on some margaritas   i like that there is a very authentic mexican menu  everything from nopales and tortilla soup to chiliquiles   we stuck to tacos and they are served up mexican style  no sides  no toppings  just meat in a tortilla so order plenty of sides didn t love the nachos  although i prefer american style nachos   you can eat a lot of different dishes for cheap and samples lots of different mexican specialties  thus the high rating i do prefer the churros at wahaca though

2194	5.0	Our first experience of Lupita was when they were still 'working out the kinks' when they were brand new. I believe it's gotten even better since our initial visit last year. The bar is now IN and contrary to another review - they do use rock salt on their margaritas now (I checked before we went). Food was tasty as ever but service is now seamless and quick. Go for happy hour and enjoy.	our first experience of lupita was when they were still  working out the kinks  when they were brand new  i believe it s gotten even better since our initial visit last year  the bar is now in and contrary to another review   they do use rock salt on their margaritas now  i checked before we went   food was tasty as ever but service is now seamless and quick  go for happy hour and enjoy 
2195	1.0	Worst restaurant experience in London.Food was decent- but the service was absolutely ABOMINABLE. Being ignored for 45 minutes by every waitperson available, having to request simple things like water and food orders several times before anything being done about it, and being followed out of the restaurant even though we had paid the bill in full.As a San Francisco native, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to see how mismanaged and poorly executed this waitstaff was. Will be spreading word to all my friends to avoid this place like the plague.Also, did I mention that it was my birthday??	worst restaurant experience in london food was decent  but the service was absolutely abominable  being ignored for 45 minutes by every waitperson available  having to request simple things like water and food orders several times before anything being done about it  and being followed out of the restaurant even though we had paid the bill in full as a san francisco native  i was extremely disappointed to see how mismanaged and poorly executed this waitstaff was  will be spreading word to all my friends to avoid this place like the plague also  did i mention that it was my birthday

I am not saying it was bad, it was just a little too upscale and expensive for what it was. I ordered the Tostada de Atun. When it arrived it was slices of raw tuna on a big cripy tortila chip basically. I was like ""...wat..."". It was seasoned with lime and actually a lot better than it looked. I also ordered one taco-chorizo con papas. Paid 1 pound extra for cheese. It was small and weird. Tasty. But small. The best part of the meal was the Vatos Locos cocktail I had to go with. I love me some Mezcal.My suggestion to the restaurant would be to add some additional Mexico City items like a Pambozo or huaraches."	i live in northern california and around here if you throw a rock you hit a mexican restaurant  i wasn t expecting the food at lupita to be super authentic and it wasn t  i am not saying it was bad  it was just a little too upscale and expensive for what it was  i ordered the tostada de atun  when it arrived it was slices of raw tuna on a big cripy tortila chip basically  i was like     wat      it was seasoned with lime and actually a lot better than it looked  i also ordered one taco chorizo con papas  paid 1 pound extra for cheese  it was small and weird  tasty  but small  the best part of the meal was the vatos locos cocktail i had to go with  i love me some mezcal my suggestion to the restaurant would be to add some additional mexico city items like a pambozo or huaraches

This was fun, and it's freshness showed in the flavour! I found the chips pretty tasteless though and a bit stale.We had a number of different dishes on the menu, some where good and other's were just pretty bland!

He proceeds to squeeze an entire tube of toothpaste in his mouth, burns his clothes and then cowers crying in the shower. This is how I feel after eating at Lupita. We had the tinga chicken tacos and the carnitas burrito and both were terrible. Of the five sauces that we tried, only one tasted like it had not been poured straight out of a can. The spicy chipotle mayo was insipid and disgusting. To add insult to injury, they charge extra for a side of this slop. The whole place looked like it needed a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms which reminded me of the free toilet you might find at a public park.	you know that scene in ace ventura when ace discovers that einhorn in a man  he proceeds to squeeze an entire tube of toothpaste in his mouth  burns his clothes and then cowers crying in the shower  this is how i feel after eating at lupita  we had the tinga chicken tacos and the carnitas burrito and both were terrible  of the five sauces that we tried  only one tasted like it had not been poured straight out of a can  the spicy chipotle mayo was insipid and disgusting  to add insult to injury  they charge extra for a side of this slop  the whole place looked like it needed a good cleaning  especially the bathrooms which reminded me of the free toilet you might find at a public park

2204	2.0	It is almost impossible to find GOOD mexican food in London....After countless dissapointments of bad tortilla chips and bad tacos I was excited to see another Mexican restaurant pop up. First of all - the service here is not the greatest. Almost impossible to get the attention of the many servers in the restaurant, or remembering to bring your 2nd order of drinks. The manager (some big Mexican guy??) seems on top of his game, but it's a shame about his staff.Anyways, heres the breakdown:Guacomole - actually not bad at all, lots of fresh ingredients and tasted similair to the ones Ive had in Cali.Tortilla chips - not fresh, tasted the kind you buy from the bag. Hard to find a place that actually mkes fresh chips from flour tortillas.Tacos carnitas- lots of flavor, probaby the best thing on the menuQuesedilla with beef? - uses cheddar cheese or something which makes the dish taste a bit sickeningCoffee/espresso margaritas - delicious, basically like a frothy espresso martini YUMConclusion - it's decent and i probably would have given a another star if it wasn't so pricey.	it is almost impossible to find good mexican food in london    after countless dissapointments of bad tortilla chips and bad tacos i was excited to see another mexican restaurant pop up  first of all   the service here is not the greatest  almost impossible to get the attention of the many servers in the restaurant  or remembering to bring your 2nd order of drinks  the manager  some big mexican guy    seems on top of his game  but it s a shame about his staff anyways  heres the breakdown guacomole   actually not bad at all  lots of fresh ingredients and tasted similair to the ones ive had in cali tortilla chips   not fresh  tasted the kind you buy from the bag  hard to find a place that actually mkes fresh chips from flour tortillas tacos carnitas  lots of flavor  probaby the best thing on the menuquesedilla with beef    uses cheddar cheese or something which makes the dish taste a bit sickeningcoffee espresso margaritas   delicious  basically like a frothy espresso martini yumconclusion   it s decent and i probably would have given a another star if it wasn t so pricey

It was bustling but not overcrowded so we were still able to hear and enjoy each others company. The food was in fact delightful - tasteful, generous portions that were very flavorful. The service was good and our pitcher of Margaritas was well received by all. Although I rarely crave Mexican food, I will definitely return.	mexican food is not my favorite but with its convenient location and being out voted i found myself at lupita for dinner one night  it was bustling but not overcrowded so we were still able to hear and enjoy each others company  the food was in fact delightful   tasteful  generous portions that were very flavorful  the service was good and our pitcher of margaritas was well received by all  although i rarely crave mexican food  i will definitely return

2208	4.0	I liked Lupita! We stumbled across it walking up to the Strand from Embankment station and thought -- yeah, why not! It was 5:30 and already almost full, so in we went and sat right down, luckily because 20 minutes later the tables were all full.We got guacamole and I confess I was a teeny bit disappointed in it, though ours was full of avocado and all the other veg, I too felt I'd like to see it mixed at our table so we could call which ingredients we wanted more or less of. But there was lots of it. We had to buy chips, which one should not have to do in a Mexican restaurant, but at least the three salsas were home made and delicious and each different in flavour and heat.I agree that they need to make their own chips, or at least, don't give people the tiny crushed ones from the bottom of the bag because who can use a crumb to pick up some sauce or guac? At least sort them, because if we have to pay for each bowl of chips, each bowl of chips should be perfect!And since chips are one of the most ubiquitous parts of a Mexican meal, they need to be freshly made on site. Really, folks, how hard is it to deep-fry your own corn tortillas? I ALWAYS do that when I'm cooking Mexican at home, because that alone makes people think the meal is amazing. It's so easy and makes such a huge difference, all restaurants that purport to have authentic Mexican food should be frying their own chips, not pouring them out of a bag.That quibble aside (but it's not a small one, Lupita, you really need to change this!!) the food was quite good. However the refried beans came buried under more chips, which we had already ordered another basket of for finishing our Guacamole. Couldn't the waiter have warned us that the refritos were going to come under an avalanche of chips so we could have not wasted an entire basket of them? And I couldn't even dig out the beans. Please don't serve them under chips, keep the two things separate so we can decide how many chips to eat with the beans. I mean, maybe I wanted to eat them with a fork or add them to my vulcan tacos with mushrooms (best part of the meal, BTW). But that was impossible to do. The tacos carnitas (slow-cooked barbecued pork) were terrific, but we had to order our ten year old two plates of them, the portions are so tiny that they are barely even tapas-sized. The torilla soup was the best thing ever!So kind of an up and down experience. We had no problems with the waiter except that even though he looked like a blond surfer (He was, we asked) he had a thick Mexico City accent that made communication a bit challenging. But I like to use my Spanish so that worked out okay.We loved the soft drinks, the Hibiscus Flower and the passionfruit ones were great!The salsas are excellent and varied and the authentic pickled hot peppers were too. We liked it and will go back but there are areas that still need improvement. I hope Lupita deals with them because I'd like to see it become the terrific Mexican restaurant it shows glimmers of being able to be!We had leftovers and my final negative is that when we asked for some way to takeaway our food, they said they don't do takeaway and had nothing for us to put it in. SO I cleaned out the paper coffee cup I had with me when we came in and stuffed it full of pickles, guacamole and chips and beans and took it home that way. But if we pay for the food and can't eat it all at the time, we should be able to take it home, Lupita. Our waiter said they are going to get some containers but just didn't have them yet, so perhaps this area will improve.	i liked lupita  we stumbled across it walking up to the strand from embankment station and thought    yeah  why not  it was 5 30 and already almost full  so in we went and sat right down  luckily because 20 minutes later the tables were all full we got guacamole and i confess i was a teeny bit disappointed in it  though ours was full of avocado and all the other veg  i too felt i d like to see it mixed at our table so we could call which ingredients we wanted more or less of  but there was lots of it  we had to buy chips  which one should not have to do in a mexican restaurant  but at least the three salsas were home made and delicious and each different in flavour and heat i agree that they need to make their own chips  or at least  don t give people the tiny crushed ones from the bottom of the bag because who can use a crumb to pick up some sauce or guac  at least sort them  because if we have to pay for each bowl of chips  each bowl of chips should be perfect and since chips are one of the most ubiquitous parts of a mexican meal  they need to be freshly made on site  really  folks  how hard is it to deep fry your own corn tortillas  i always do that when i m cooking mexican at home  because that alone makes people think the meal is amazing  it s so easy and makes such a huge difference  all restaurants that purport to have authentic mexican food should be frying their own chips  not pouring them out of a bag that quibble aside  but it s not a small one  lupita  you really need to change this    the food was quite good  however the refried beans came buried under more chips  which we had already ordered another basket of for finishing our guacamole  couldn t the waiter have warned us that the refritos were going to come under an avalanche of chips so we could have not wasted an entire basket of them  and i couldn t even dig out the beans  please don t serve them under chips  keep the two things separate so we can decide how many chips to eat with the beans  i mean  maybe i wanted to eat them with a fork or add them to my vulcan tacos with mushrooms  best part of the meal  btw   but that was impossible to do  the tacos carnitas  slow cooked barbecued pork  were terrific  but we had to order our ten year old two plates of them  the portions are so tiny that they are barely even tapas sized  the torilla soup was the best thing ever so kind of an up and down experience  we had no problems with the waiter except that even though he looked like a blond surfer  he was  we asked  he had a thick mexico city accent that made communication a bit challenging  but i like to use my spanish so that worked out okay we loved the soft drinks  the hibiscus flower and the passionfruit ones were great the salsas are excellent and varied and the authentic pickled hot peppers were too  we liked it and will go back but there are areas that still need improvement  i hope lupita deals with them because i d like to see it become the terrific mexican restaurant it shows glimmers of being able to be we had leftovers and my final negative is that when we asked for some way to takeaway our food  they said they don t do takeaway and had nothing for us to put it in  so i cleaned out the paper coffee cup i had with me when we came in and stuffed it full of pickles  guacamole and chips and beans and took it home that way  but if we pay for the food and can t eat it all at the time  we should be able to take it home  lupita  our waiter said they are going to get some containers but just didn t have them yet  so perhaps this area will improve 
2209	4.0	"For Mexican in London, it's respectable. And it's an extra-friendly place with great bartenders and servers. If you're looking for a lively place to go for a drink, this place is a sure bet. The friendly bartender downstairs pours great margaritas, and even knows how to make a ""bandera"" a special drink named after the Mexican flag.For the food, the next time I go, I will have to work on my ordering.

2210	4.0	There is mexican food and then there is Mexican food. Lupita serves the latter. If your only thought about Mexican food is either nachos and guacamole this place may either delight or disappoint. Mexican food and veganism are not exactly kissing buddies, but they made a real effort to accommodate my restricted palette, and had a number of delicious items (the cactus was actually really tasty - much better than the last place I had it). If you are open to carne and other delights, then you should really enjoy yourself. Unlike others I found the service excellent, and found the explanations of the dishes and attentiveness of the waiters first rate. The tequila and Mexican beer selection is also stand-out. Highly recommended.	there is mexican food and then there is mexican food  lupita serves the latter  if your only thought about mexican food is either nachos and guacamole this place may either delight or disappoint  mexican food and veganism are not exactly kissing buddies  but they made a real effort to accommodate my restricted palette  and had a number of delicious items  the cactus was actually really tasty   much better than the last place i had it   if you are open to carne and other delights  then you should really enjoy yourself  unlike others i found the service excellent  and found the explanations of the dishes and attentiveness of the waiters first rate  the tequila and mexican beer selection is also stand out  highly recommended 
2211	3.0	Oh Lupita, I had such high hopes for us, I thought we could really be something to each other. But you let me down, like all the rest. Wahaca, you can breathe easy, Lupita will not be coming to steal your undeserved London taqueria food crown any time soon. I was really excited to give this place a try, the menu looks authentic and full of weird and exciting things. Cactus, truffle quesdillas and guacamole that they make at your table. Sadly the food was so mediocre. The cactus was canned, understandably enough. But the guac  was just a big bowl of onion and tomato with some avocado cubes. Not prepared at our table, though I did see them do it for others. Are some tables more special than others? Let's call it an onion dip because it was in no way guacamole and for £7, I want some damn avocado mashed with effort!After our first round of food, which was so disappointing, we ordered some nachos. After all, who does nachos badly? Lupita. The service was woeful and my companions told me to leave less than the added 12.5% but I am way too non-confrontation for that. They brought the wrong drinks, never explained why we didn't get our guac made for us, forgot my sour cream and just disappeared for ages. On the brightside I love the modern feel of the place and you can sit at the bar if you are by yourself. Maybe you should because the tables are tiny. I know it's new, but it would really need to try harder to survive now that these new 'authentic Mexican' places are popping up everywhere. I'm bumping it to a three because in my heart it's a two star but it's so new you need to give it a chance yourself.	oh lupita  i had such high hopes for us  i thought we could really be something to each other  but you let me down  like all the rest  wahaca  you can breathe easy  lupita will not be coming to steal your undeserved london taqueria food crown any time soon  i was really excited to give this place a try  the menu looks authentic and full of weird and exciting things  cactus  truffle quesdillas and guacamole that they make at your table  sadly the food was so mediocre  the cactus was canned  understandably enough  but the guac  was just a big bowl of onion and tomato with some avocado cubes  not prepared at our table  though i did see them do it for others  are some tables more special than others  let s call it an onion dip because it was in no way guacamole and for  7  i want some damn avocado mashed with effort after our first round of food  which was so disappointing  we ordered some nachos  after all  who does nachos badly  lupita  the service was woeful and my companions told me to leave less than the added 12 5  but i am way too non confrontation for that  they brought the wrong drinks  never explained why we didn t get our guac made for us  forgot my sour cream and just disappeared for ages  on the brightside i love the modern feel of the place and you can sit at the bar if you are by yourself  maybe you should because the tables are tiny  i know it s new  but it would really need to try harder to survive now that these new  authentic mexican  places are popping up everywhere  i m bumping it to a three because in my heart it s a two star but it s so new you need to give it a chance yourself

2213	2.0	Mexican food is a divisive thing.If you like yours bland and expensive, you might want to try out Lupita.Conversely, if you like your guacamole to be absolutely heaving with onions and chillis, therefore obliterating any tasty freshness of the comparatively tiny portion of avocado, then Lupita's got you covered too.For me, Lupita seriously underperformed, as I like my Mexican food tasty and cheap and my guacamole refreshing and limey.  I have granted Lupita an extra star for having mixed me a perfectly respectable margarita, even if they tried and failed to coat the rim of my glass with table salt.That's right... table. salt.	mexican food is a divisive thing if you like yours bland and expensive  you might want to try out lupita conversely  if you like your guacamole to be absolutely heaving with onions and chillis  therefore obliterating any tasty freshness of the comparatively tiny portion of avocado  then lupita s got you covered too for me  lupita seriously underperformed  as i like my mexican food tasty and cheap and my guacamole refreshing and limey   i have granted lupita an extra star for having mixed me a perfectly respectable margarita  even if they tried and failed to coat the rim of my glass with table salt that s right    table  salt

The place is also very cute, looks small from the outside but it's actually pretty big with more tables at the back and downstairs. And for once, downstairs is as lovely if not better than the ground floor with a cosy/lively atmosphere and characteristic decor. Service also excellent, friendly and fast.

2217	4.0	The food here is really tasty and the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly (especially the guy mentioned by Danielle below - I know who she means!). I've been about four times now, and never disappointed.I always go for the same dish - the torta with ceviche, as this is the place I first ordered ceviche (after I saw Nigella make it!) and it's really delicious. The coolness and acidity of the fish compliments the crunchy tortilla perfectly. They could give you a bit more for the price, but the small-ish sizes of the dishes leave plenty of room for desert!Now I really love the churros here, but the dessert menu itself is no match for Wahaca up by Covent Garden, which does AMAZING dolce de leche ice cream with dark chocolate chips and a larger variety. Saying that, there's still a decent choice at Lupita.This restaurant is often busy but I have always managed to get a seat. I like it a lot.	the food here is really tasty and the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly  especially the guy mentioned by danielle below   i know who she means    i ve been about four times now  and never disappointed i always go for the same dish   the torta with ceviche  as this is the place i first ordered ceviche  after i saw nigella make it   and it s really delicious  the coolness and acidity of the fish compliments the crunchy tortilla perfectly  they could give you a bit more for the price  but the small ish sizes of the dishes leave plenty of room for desert now i really love the churros here  but the dessert menu itself is no match for wahaca up by covent garden  which does amazing dolce de leche ice cream with dark chocolate chips and a larger variety  saying that  there s still a decent choice at lupita this restaurant is often busy but i have always managed to get a seat  i like it a lot

2224	2.0	"Finding myself in need of a bite and in the Villiers Street area I figured I might as well go check out Lupita: any opportunity to check out a potential new source of burritos has got to be a good thing, right? In summary, ""Okay"". What these guys served up under the description ""burrito"" was not anything approaching my understanding of what a burrito is. A toasted wrap, perhaps. Seemingly a small example, but with London being a hotbed of burrito availibility right now, this is a crucial thing to get right. I asked for no tomato, and the waiter to his credit tried to make it all better by offering me a 15% discount after he forgot to tell the cooks not to add tomato. In hindsight there was so little tomato on the thing anyway it made little or no difference. And come to it, the wrap was reasonably tasty. But a burrito it were not. The corn chips to start were very nice, and not Doritos out-of-the-bag like I thought they might be. And again, to their credit, to make amends for screwing up my order the waiter gave me a free raspberry sambuca shot. Which was weird. As was the music, which seemed to be less about trying to create any sense of enjoyable ambience for the customer, and more about listening to stuff that the kitchen staff wanted to listen to as they worked. It seems wrong to mark Lupita down so much when the waiter was obviously so penitent about slightly mismanaging my order, however to distinguish yourself in the centre of London you've got to be Good.

2228	2.0	I understand why others like Lupita -- if you haven't been fortunate enough to stumble upon other authentic Mexican restaurants in London (both of them), then Lupita can appear like a beacon in the mist. Pros: Service is friendly, and the atmosphere is fun/bustling. Better food than Wahaca in nearby Covent Garden (albeit we're talking about two different types of Mexican cuisine). Cons: The tacos are not as flavourful as Boho Mexica; for example, the carnitas were bland at Lupita compared to the melt-in-your-mouth conchinitas, served appropriately with a sprinkling of pickled onions to add an extra zing. Price-wise Boho Mexica now looks much more reasonable next to Lupita. For other dishes, Mestizo is multiple tiers above what Lupita offers. The tray of dips offers a watery and tasteless avocado option that pales next to the potential of guacomole derivatives. And where's the horchata???	i understand why others like lupita    if you haven t been fortunate enough to stumble upon other authentic mexican restaurants in london  both of them   then lupita can appear like a beacon in the mist  pros  service is friendly  and the atmosphere is fun bustling  better food than wahaca in nearby covent garden  albeit we re talking about two different types of mexican cuisine   cons  the tacos are not as flavourful as boho mexica  for example  the carnitas were bland at lupita compared to the melt in your mouth conchinitas  served appropriately with a sprinkling of pickled onions to add an extra zing  price wise boho mexica now looks much more reasonable next to lupita  for other dishes  mestizo is multiple tiers above what lupita offers  the tray of dips offers a watery and tasteless avocado option that pales next to the potential of guacomole derivatives  and where s the horchata

2237	5.0	This is, hands down, my favourite Mexican restaurant in London. The food is delicious, with many and varied interesting vegetarian options. I'm a particular fan of the Chicharron de Queso which is essentially a thin piece of deep fried cheese. Nothing wrong with that! Last time I went with a vegetarian friend and we had the vegetarian platter for two which, at £18.50, is quite expensive but gives you an extraordinary amount of very nice food. The margaritas are also very very good. The only real downside to Lupita is that the atmosphere isn't great  it's crammed full of tables and is quite noisy. The downstairs is a bit quieter but still not great.

Notwithstanding the fact that Mestizo in Hampstead Rd has been around for years, there's nothing authentic about this place. The food is a pale imitation of real Mexican fare - flavours are bland, portions are small, and it's expensive. To top it off, the service was truly awful - after sitting there for 15 mins, we had to ask several staff before anyone took our order. Then, half of our order was forgotten about, and the other half they got wrong.

I arrived there with my girlfriend and just seconds after sitting down a very overwhelming and overconfident waitress literally pulled a chair and sat next to us she started an awkward conversation while waiting for our order. We ordered a few dishes; the ceviche tostada was lonely in the plate compared to the 2 portions that other mexican restaurants like wahaca serve, the fish was tasteless and not marinated enough so it was still a bit raw. After that I had a new dish on the menu, tacos de birria; typically the feeling is a tender lamb marinated in a chilli sauce but it almost seemed like it was just a chunk of flavour less meet straight from the oven, after that we had some arrachera tacos, our mistake while ordering this dish was that we ask them with cheese and the whole taco was flooded by it, the flavour of the cheese took over and it was not as enjoyable, one important remark is that the taco portions are 2 per serving compared to the 3 portions or even 4 in other similar restaurants. Finally the best part of the food was the quesadilla lupita; very good and tasty with a rich filling of exotic flor the calabaza and mushrooms and the frijoles refritos side with chorizo, the chorizo was simply amazing you really have to dig in away from the overloaded tortilla chips to get some but the taste is absolutely superb. Drinks were very well done, the agua de jamaica (hibiscus) is one of the tastiest I've ever had in london and the michelada I always go for was well done. Overall it was a good experience.	lupita is a small restaurant just steps away from embankment and charing cross stations  the deco has a modern mexican feeling to it without loosing the simplicity of a real mexican taqueria  i arrived there with my girlfriend and just seconds after sitting down a very overwhelming and overconfident waitress literally pulled a chair and sat next to us she started an awkward conversation while waiting for our order  we ordered a few dishes  the ceviche tostada was lonely in the plate compared to the 2 portions that other mexican restaurants like wahaca serve  the fish was tasteless and not marinated enough so it was still a bit raw  after that i had a new dish on the menu  tacos de birria  typically the feeling is a tender lamb marinated in a chilli sauce but it almost seemed like it was just a chunk of flavour less meet straight from the oven  after that we had some arrachera tacos  our mistake while ordering this dish was that we ask them with cheese and the whole taco was flooded by it  the flavour of the cheese took over and it was not as enjoyable  one important remark is that the taco portions are 2 per serving compared to the 3 portions or even 4 in other similar restaurants  finally the best part of the food was the quesadilla lupita  very good and tasty with a rich filling of exotic flor the calabaza and mushrooms and the frijoles refritos side with chorizo  the chorizo was simply amazing you really have to dig in away from the overloaded tortilla chips to get some but the taste is absolutely superb  drinks were very well done  the agua de jamaica  hibiscus  is one of the tastiest i ve ever had in london and the michelada i always go for was well done  overall it was a good experience 
2242	2.0	"Eh. I've only tried about 4 Mexican places in London and this is neither the best nor the worst. I wouldn't exactly call it ""authentic"" like other reviewers have stated. The rice was decent. The tacos... two to a plate for a slightly high price (for tacos). Only one pseudo-tortilla for each taco, which is super soft (uncooked) so it breaks easily. I had both the chicken and nopales tacos. The chicken was really dry. I'm not sure how to describe the nopales. They were a bit on the soggy side. The only thing I really liked was the salsa verde. It made the tacos taste more like tacos. If you're looking for a decent ""Mexican"" meal, I guess this would suffice. The only authentic taco place I've had here in London was from this taco stand called Tacos Jalisco in Camden Town 2 years ago. I've been looking for him but sadly, I don't think he's around anymore. As a Mexican-American from Southern California, I'm a bit disappointed that London is deprived of authentic Mexican food."	eh  i ve only tried about 4 mexican places in london and this is neither the best nor the worst  i wouldn t exactly call it  authentic  like other reviewers have stated  the rice was decent  the tacos    two to a plate for a slightly high price  for tacos   only one pseudo tortilla for each taco  which is super soft  uncooked  so it breaks easily  i had both the chicken and nopales tacos  the chicken was really dry  i m not sure how to describe the nopales  they were a bit on the soggy side  the only thing i really liked was the salsa verde  it made the tacos taste more like tacos  if you re looking for a decent  mexican  meal  i guess this would suffice  the only authentic taco place i ve had here in london was from this taco stand called tacos jalisco in camden town 2 years ago  i ve been looking for him but sadly  i don t think he s around anymore  as a mexican american from southern california  i m a bit disappointed that london is deprived of authentic mexican food

Location is great and shame on me for thinking I could get real authentic Mexican food in London. As an Paddy from LA I should have know better. Two greasy carnitas tacos, two semi aqua frescas and a tostada atun all for less than £22.

2246	5.0	I find Lupita's food is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in London, together perhaps with Mestizo. The staff is warm and lively, and are helpful with recommendations when i bring friends who have no clue what to pick from their varied menu. Was glad to see nopales and clamato on the menu! I also noticed there are regularly a number of Latin American (from their accents) eating there which is a solid guarantee for food authenticity!	i find lupita s food is one of the most authentic mexican restaurants in london  together perhaps with mestizo  the staff is warm and lively  and are helpful with recommendations when i bring friends who have no clue what to pick from their varied menu  was glad to see nopales and clamato on the menu  i also noticed there are regularly a number of latin american  from their accents  eating there which is a solid guarantee for food authenticity 
2247	4.0	Upstairs is nice, downstairs has a more unfinished look, with breeze blocks serving as a bench at one table. Service is good, and the dishes are very tasty with lots of mexican flavours on the menu. Good beer too. Dishes are quite small and it has more of a tapas feel than a main course, so you might have to order two to three dishes each. Don't underestimate the side sauces, they have a considerable chilli kick.	upstairs is nice  downstairs has a more unfinished look  with breeze blocks serving as a bench at one table  service is good  and the dishes are very tasty with lots of mexican flavours on the menu  good beer too  dishes are quite small and it has more of a tapas feel than a main course  so you might have to order two to three dishes each  don t underestimate the side sauces  they have a considerable chilli kick

2249	5.0	I celebrated my birthday yesterday at Lupita and was very impressed by the customer service and the extent to which the staff went to make our night special, so wanted to express my gratitude online by way of a good review. We had a great night and felt very comfortable. The food was amazing with very interesting flavours, and different to what we were used to. I especially enjoyed the margaritas! Therefore I was really surprised to come across some of these comments. To aherring16: WOW - has Wahaca spent its whole marketing budget for the year already that it has had to resort to this? If you are not someone that works for Wahaca, then what has Lupita done to you to make you this vindictive and bitter? Out of curiosity I went to your profile and see that you have only reviewed twice - once for Lupita saying it was the worse place, and the SAME DAY reviewing and glorifying Wahaca. PEOPLE - Wake up and smell the G-wahaca-mole... Do you have any idea of the damage these kind of reviews can do to a business, especially when it is ALL RUBBISH? Are you trying to help close a business? To state that it is MICROWAVED TEX MEX is slanderous for starters. How can can you say this, when the food is cooked in the central kitchen in full view of everyone. Lupita is owned and run by Mexicans whilst Wahaca was started by an american lady who went to Mexico once, liked the food and then won Masterchef (all credit to her) If you had such a bad experience at Lupita, did you inform the manager on duty of your dissatisfaction and give them a chance to rectify the situation for you? Normally, people complain, get a free drink and get on with it.On the occasions I have eaten at Wahaca, sure, the food was ok, but it felt like any other chain restaurant. Given the choice, for me Lupita would win every time, especially on authenticity.For anyone reading these reviews, I would recommend trying Lupita for yourself and making your own opinion.	i celebrated my birthday yesterday at lupita and was very impressed by the customer service and the extent to which the staff went to make our night special  so wanted to express my gratitude online by way of a good review  we had a great night and felt very comfortable  the food was amazing with very interesting flavours  and different to what we were used to  i especially enjoyed the margaritas  therefore i was really surprised to come across some of these comments  to aherring16  wow   has wahaca spent its whole marketing budget for the year already that it has had to resort to this  if you are not someone that works for wahaca  then what has lupita done to you to make you this vindictive and bitter  out of curiosity i went to your profile and see that you have only reviewed twice   once for lupita saying it was the worse place  and the same day reviewing and glorifying wahaca  people   wake up and smell the g wahaca mole    do you have any idea of the damage these kind of reviews can do to a business  especially when it is all rubbish  are you trying to help close a business  to state that it is microwaved tex mex is slanderous for starters  how can can you say this  when the food is cooked in the central kitchen in full view of everyone  lupita is owned and run by mexicans whilst wahaca was started by an american lady who went to mexico once  liked the food and then won masterchef  all credit to her  if you had such a bad experience at lupita  did you inform the manager on duty of your dissatisfaction and give them a chance to rectify the situation for you  normally  people complain  get a free drink and get on with it on the occasions i have eaten at wahaca  sure  the food was ok  but it felt like any other chain restaurant  given the choice  for me lupita would win every time  especially on authenticity for anyone reading these reviews  i would recommend trying lupita for yourself and making your own opinion

2252	2.0	I fucking love Jamie Oliver...But I fucking hated this restaurant. Went in on a Wednesday night. Around 830. Busy but plenty of seats open. Service was great. Lovely space. Food came out lightning quick (almost too quick). The meatballs were overdone and tiny and NOT spicy. The Pate was decent but a bit liquidy?The bread for both was mediocre. I should have listened to the waiter who favoured the pasta over the pork but when I saw 10oz tomahawk chop with crackling I had to get it. It was no way no how 10oz. It was unevenly cooked. The sauce and purée was ok. The broccoli was bland. The crackling was inedible. I almost broke my tooth biting into it. My friend was very meh about his chicken dish. Waiter was great and was kind enough to listen to my passive aggressive comments and gave us a small discount. Honestly he was the only saving grace for this disappointing meal. Maybe my expectations were too high since i cook lots of JO's stuff at home. In a city with a billion choices, I would likely never go back. PS:6 hours later:  I can't stop farting.	i fucking love jamie oliver   but i fucking hated this restaurant  went in on a wednesday night  around 830  busy but plenty of seats open  service was great  lovely space  food came out lightning quick  almost too quick   the meatballs were overdone and tiny and not spicy  the pate was decent but a bit liquidy the bread for both was mediocre  i should have listened to the waiter who favoured the pasta over the pork but when i saw 10oz tomahawk chop with crackling i had to get it  it was no way no how 10oz  it was unevenly cooked  the sauce and pur e was ok  the broccoli was bland  the crackling was inedible  i almost broke my tooth biting into it  my friend was very meh about his chicken dish  waiter was great and was kind enough to listen to my passive aggressive comments and gave us a small discount  honestly he was the only saving grace for this disappointing meal  maybe my expectations were too high since i cook lots of jo s stuff at home  in a city with a billion choices  i would likely never go back  ps 6 hours later   i can t stop farting 
2253	5.0	walkin around covent Garden in the UK and stumbled upon this place by accident! place was packed for lunch hour with a line-up! came back and took a chance for dinner service and so lucky to get a table for 4 with just a 10min wait. the servers and table hostess very very nice and attentive. took the time to explain everything in detail what was on special etc. for starters, we tried the  polenta, as ive seen jaime make it on tv, as well as the crispy squid (calamari) and the truffle pasta! for mains, we tried the pasta carbonara with pancetta,  steak tagliatta ( medium) , and the chicken al mattone! ( see menu pict).the starters were awesome. polenta was made fresh and served piping hot with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. nice crisp coating on the outside but moist and tender on the inside.  one bite and steam comes out from the inside telling its made to order. the steak was served medium as per request. tender and cooked perfectly. no need for A1 sauce or whatever, it was seasoned just right. each bite was juicy goodness and outside was charred beautifully. the carbonara was nothing to rave about except that it was good. no wow factor. the plus factor however, was that they used real pancetta pieces as garnish. very nice touch!the chicken breast was also cooked, seasoned, and charred perfectly. inside was not dry but tender and moist. shows you the skill set of the chef. the best dish of the dinner service was the truffle pasta.! pasta was al dente. sauce was so immaculate. creamy and rich in truffle flavour. one bite and it brought tears to my eyes. such talent and craftsmanship. wow! to kick it up a notch, the dish was sprinkled with bits of truffles. the saltiness of the truffles and the creamy sauce just took this dish to a whole new level. when eaten together, you know you've got a winner! elevates the taste buds and senses to new heights like no other. its simplicity is also is most powerful attribute! a must visit when in UK!! cheers! happy eating!!	walkin around covent garden in the uk and stumbled upon this place by accident  place was packed for lunch hour with a line up  came back and took a chance for dinner service and so lucky to get a table for 4 with just a 10min wait  the servers and table hostess very very nice and attentive  took the time to explain everything in detail what was on special etc  for starters  we tried the  polenta  as ive seen jaime make it on tv  as well as the crispy squid  calamari  and the truffle pasta  for mains  we tried the pasta carbonara with pancetta   steak tagliatta   medium    and the chicken al mattone    see menu pict  the starters were awesome  polenta was made fresh and served piping hot with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese  nice crisp coating on the outside but moist and tender on the inside   one bite and steam comes out from the inside telling its made to order  the steak was served medium as per request  tender and cooked perfectly  no need for a1 sauce or whatever  it was seasoned just right  each bite was juicy goodness and outside was charred beautifully  the carbonara was nothing to rave about except that it was good  no wow factor  the plus factor however  was that they used real pancetta pieces as garnish  very nice touch the chicken breast was also cooked  seasoned  and charred perfectly  inside was not dry but tender and moist  shows you the skill set of the chef  the best dish of the dinner service was the truffle pasta   pasta was al dente  sauce was so immaculate  creamy and rich in truffle flavour  one bite and it brought tears to my eyes  such talent and craftsmanship  wow  to kick it up a notch  the dish was sprinkled with bits of truffles  the saltiness of the truffles and the creamy sauce just took this dish to a whole new level  when eaten together  you know you ve got a winner  elevates the taste buds and senses to new heights like no other  its simplicity is also is most powerful attribute  a must visit when in uk   cheers  happy eating  
2254	5.0	We tried three of their pastas and they were beyond amazing. I ordered one whole dish and my friend ordered two halves (each $1 or $2 more than if you cut the price in half), but they come in two separate dishes so the two halves combined were way more than one whole dish (hint hint)! The drinks were cute and the tiramisu was amazing. Will be sure to return!	we tried three of their pastas and they were beyond amazing  i ordered one whole dish and my friend ordered two halves  each  1 or  2 more than if you cut the price in half   but they come in two separate dishes so the two halves combined were way more than one whole dish  hint hint   the drinks were cute and the tiramisu was amazing  will be sure to return

We explained that we were in a rush and let them know what time we had other plans, they served us quickly and we made our plans.The chicken pate starter on the lunch menu was very good and my husband got the truffle pasta starter, it was also good but it was just noodles with truffle oil so nothing special.  My entree was amazing, the steak was rare which I love but they did not ask so if someone does not like a rare steak.  My husband ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich which was awesome!!!	the lunch special was excellent   my only complaint was that they did not offer tap water even though it s available and the bottled was 4 pounds   they did take it off the check when i mentioned the issue   they also did not offer lunch special menu even though it s available   we had to ask  we explained that we were in a rush and let them know what time we had other plans  they served us quickly and we made our plans the chicken pate starter on the lunch menu was very good and my husband got the truffle pasta starter  it was also good but it was just noodles with truffle oil so nothing special   my entree was amazing  the steak was rare which i love but they did not ask so if someone does not like a rare steak   my husband ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich which was awesome

2259	2.0	Either my taste in good Italian food has vastly improved, or this restaurant has gone severely downhill. The vibe is fine, and the staff are nice and polite, but the food I had this afternoon was actually quite awful and I left feeling quite sick. I had chargrilled broccoli (which was overcooked and actually cold. It was so oily that it almost made me throw up). I also had a roasted cauliflower main course that was waaaaaay overcooked, and mozzarella arancini balls that were totally okay. I chose Jamie's because I was with a large-ish group and it was easy, but I won't be in a hurry to come back.	either my taste in good italian food has vastly improved  or this restaurant has gone severely downhill  the vibe is fine  and the staff are nice and polite  but the food i had this afternoon was actually quite awful and i left feeling quite sick  i had chargrilled broccoli  which was overcooked and actually cold  it was so oily that it almost made me throw up   i also had a roasted cauliflower main course that was waaaaaay overcooked  and mozzarella arancini balls that were totally okay  i chose jamie s because i was with a large ish group and it was easy  but i won t be in a hurry to come back

That's just embarrassing. It will put you off your food. But let me get to the food, I would say a weak average. Pasta did not taste made on site ""daily"". I would wager it wasn't. The sauces taste canned and yet bland at the same time. The bread came out with no olive oil for dipping and was dry and tough. The ""fried"" ravioli were undercooked and chewy.

The price was also not appealing for what it was.

The food was good however the place was very loud, staff was slow, and when I came out of the bathroom there was a man in there cleaning.

We ended up paying for the food since we were too embarrassed to tell the manager how disappointed we were with the food. At the end of it all, we ended up waiting over an hour for Dishoom since their food is to die for.

Jamie's Italian was reasonably priced, no wait, great for families, a full meal or bites and a drink. We had drinks and a few bar bites: calamari, cold olives and tapenade, and croquets. All were delicious! The croquettes were light and airy, the cold Oliver's and tapenade were out of this world-spicy and fresh with sun dried tomato. The calamari was light and fresh. Overall we loved the food and enjoyed our experience.

2265	3.0	Came here back in February and received excellent service. Funny enough, our most favorite dish was the bread board with the variety of dips- the bread was so fresh and the dips and spreads were the perfect compliment. This place is also extremely kid friendly, with a healthy menu that the kiddos enjoyed picking from. My husband got the Bolognese, which was pretty good,  but my seafood pasta was just ok- a little too al dente for my taste. I think this place is a safe bet if you are hungry, but aside from the service, bread board, and kid's menu, nothing was super memorable.	came here back in february and received excellent service  funny enough  our most favorite dish was the bread board with the variety of dips  the bread was so fresh and the dips and spreads were the perfect compliment  this place is also extremely kid friendly  with a healthy menu that the kiddos enjoyed picking from  my husband got the bolognese  which was pretty good   but my seafood pasta was just ok  a little too al dente for my taste  i think this place is a safe bet if you are hungry  but aside from the service  bread board  and kid s menu  nothing was super memorable 
2266	2.0	Emphatically average. The service was friendly and the mozarella on the bruschetta appetizer was very tasty. The pasta was soggy and overcooked for the pasta bolognese, which was upsetting because I think the bolognese itself wasn't bad. The real disappointment was from the brownie dessert, which tasted like something I could pick up at the airport. The texture was really weird, soft, and sticky. I do like that it came with popcorn for the much needed added crunch, but it should have come with a lot more popcorn to compensate for the bizarre mouthfeel that the brownie itself had.	emphatically average  the service was friendly and the mozarella on the bruschetta appetizer was very tasty  the pasta was soggy and overcooked for the pasta bolognese  which was upsetting because i think the bolognese itself wasn t bad  the real disappointment was from the brownie dessert  which tasted like something i could pick up at the airport  the texture was really weird  soft  and sticky  i do like that it came with popcorn for the much needed added crunch  but it should have come with a lot more popcorn to compensate for the bizarre mouthfeel that the brownie itself had

I came here after the theater and it wasn't too crowded.  Simple burger and polenta fries.Waiter did not deliver my food someone else did.  He was struggling to find my table and was carrying it around.My waiter never once stopped by to see if everything was OK, or if I needed anything.  He did clear my plate and belatedly bring me my check plus a coupon if I ever was to return. The polenta fries were so greasy I couldn't eat them, the burger was not hot, the service was inattentive. I gave my coupon to someone else because I will never return.	what a disappointment  i came here after the theater and it wasn t too crowded   simple burger and polenta fries waiter did not deliver my food someone else did   he was struggling to find my table and was carrying it around my waiter never once stopped by to see if everything was ok  or if i needed anything   he did clear my plate and belatedly bring me my check plus a coupon if i ever was to return  the polenta fries were so greasy i couldn t eat them  the burger was not hot  the service was inattentive  i gave my coupon to someone else because i will never return

We finally figured out that maybe a Manhattan belongs in the US not in London.  My mother in law's gin and tonic was light on the gin and my Aperol spritz was also pretty weak.  Natalie, our server, was so friendly and just super sweet!  Her fun and cheerful demeanor more than made up for the awful cocktail snafus.  She even brought over another Manhattan for free.  We loved her!  If you stop in, make sure you ask to be seated in her section. ;)  Now the food on the other hand, was good.  We ordered the crispy calamari which was super crispy yet tender on the inside and laying on a nice aioli sauce.  Lobster ravioli was kinda disappointing, nice sauce but ravioli was undercooked and the lobster just meh. Garlic prawn pasta was delish and full of plump shrimp.  I opted for an appetizer of truffle linguini but added shrimp. They accidentally also added chicken but it complemented the already delicious  plate quite nicely.  Loved that they offered 2 sizes on dinners.  Usually portions are huge and you end up eating way too much or letting food go to waste.  Thumbs up for that!  So I say go for the food, but sneak in your booze."	we walked into this restaurant because the one  we d originally wanted to go next door had a wait of over an hour   we were seated right away and our server natalie took our drink order   the ambience was nice  busy but not too loud   the food was great  the drinks not so much   my hubby ordered 3 manhattan but each time got a different concoction with the last one being some sort of salty mystery concoction that left us wondering  wtf was that      d  we finally figured out that maybe a manhattan belongs in the us not in london   my mother in law s gin and tonic was light on the gin and my aperol spritz was also pretty weak   natalie  our server  was so friendly and just super sweet   her fun and cheerful demeanor more than made up for the awful cocktail snafus   she even brought over another manhattan for free   we loved her   if you stop in  make sure you ask to be seated in her section      now the food on the other hand  was good   we ordered the crispy calamari which was super crispy yet tender on the inside and laying on a nice aioli sauce   lobster ravioli was kinda disappointing  nice sauce but ravioli was undercooked and the lobster just meh  garlic prawn pasta was delish and full of plump shrimp   i opted for an appetizer of truffle linguini but added shrimp  they accidentally also added chicken but it complemented the already delicious  plate quite nicely   loved that they offered 2 sizes on dinners   usually portions are huge and you end up eating way too much or letting food go to waste   thumbs up for that   so i say go for the food  but sneak in your booze 
2270	5.0	Oh, I loved my dinner here!I reserved a table ahead of time and was seated twenty minutes before the time I booked. The staff are super sweet and attentive and I felt very well looked after the entire time I was here.I started off with the artisan bread starter. All the breads are freshly made in house and were delicious! Well made artisinal breads are a passion of mine and all of the ones they served were fantastic.The spaghetti carbonara were unremarkable, tasty but not outstanding, I would probably order something more exciting next time.However, the dessert was absolutely outstanding. I chose the polenta cake and I'm really glad I did! It was absolutely perfect, not too sweet, not too big, it was just right! Overall, the meal was amazing and actually not as expensive as I had expected. I'd definitely recommend this one and will certainly be back!	oh  i loved my dinner here i reserved a table ahead of time and was seated twenty minutes before the time i booked  the staff are super sweet and attentive and i felt very well looked after the entire time i was here i started off with the artisan bread starter  all the breads are freshly made in house and were delicious  well made artisinal breads are a passion of mine and all of the ones they served were fantastic the spaghetti carbonara were unremarkable  tasty but not outstanding  i would probably order something more exciting next time however  the dessert was absolutely outstanding  i chose the polenta cake and i m really glad i did  it was absolutely perfect  not too sweet  not too big  it was just right  overall  the meal was amazing and actually not as expensive as i had expected  i d definitely recommend this one and will certainly be back

2272	3.0	Jamie's Italian was OK.  I went on a Sunday night with my family, and there were seats available.  The food was only OK.  It wasn't as amazing as the hype.  We had a starter, the Ultimate plank.  We ordered it for 2 people to share between 4, and it was plenty for the starter.  Dinner was OK.  I had the baked crespelle.  The sauce was good, but it wasn't a stand out dish for me.The dish I loved was the heritage tomato salad we ordered to share.  That was tasty, simple, and combined things I wouldn't have thought would work well -- I tend to think of only caprese salads with mozarella, basil, and olive oil and vinegar.  This salad had pine nuts, a ricotta base, capers and rocket.  The large portion is a good size as an entree salad.	jamie s italian was ok   i went on a sunday night with my family  and there were seats available   the food was only ok   it wasn t as amazing as the hype   we had a starter  the ultimate plank   we ordered it for 2 people to share between 4  and it was plenty for the starter   dinner was ok   i had the baked crespelle   the sauce was good  but it wasn t a stand out dish for me the dish i loved was the heritage tomato salad we ordered to share   that was tasty  simple  and combined things i wouldn t have thought would work well    i tend to think of only caprese salads with mozarella  basil  and olive oil and vinegar   this salad had pine nuts  a ricotta base  capers and rocket   the large portion is a good size as an entree salad 
2273	3.0	Was looking forward to some good rustic Italian food. The meatball starter was delicious and the crispy squid was ok. We ordered the beetroot & potato gnocchi and lobster mezzaluna. Distinctly average. We were hoping for a much better experience after watching all Jamie's shows. The service was pretty slow and not particularly friendly or engaging. I'd say that this place is just ok, wouldn't be beating any doors down to eat here again unfortunately.	was looking forward to some good rustic italian food  the meatball starter was delicious and the crispy squid was ok  we ordered the beetroot   potato gnocchi and lobster mezzaluna  distinctly average  we were hoping for a much better experience after watching all jamie s shows  the service was pretty slow and not particularly friendly or engaging  i d say that this place is just ok  wouldn t be beating any doors down to eat here again unfortunately

I had a pasta bolognese that was fine but I was far more limited here than I was at any other restaurant we ate at in London or even in remote North Wales. I found that to be a bit surprising. And it's tricky when your waiter is a vegan because there is no, ""Well, what do you recommend?"" because he probably hasn't eaten anything on the menu. Nothing against vegans whatsoever but how are customers supposed to get trusted recommendations?

I like a pasta that bites back but it could have been left a minute longer. Sauce was nothing extraordinary. Service was decent but that is expected in London. People here are a bit bland and unfriendly.	nice setting with a view of the street which was cool  had the spaghetti with meatballs  the pork meatballs were good  well prepared  pasta was a tad under cooked  i like a pasta that bites back but it could have been left a minute longer  sauce was nothing extraordinary  service was decent but that is expected in london  people here are a bit bland and unfriendly 
2280	3.0	In our case the restaurant was nearly empty and the staff was only waiting for guests. My partner ordered simple gnocchis and I ordered a veggie burger with sweet potato fries. The food was alright but really nothing great. The prices are reasonable and the location is nice. The drink was something with strawberry and tasted not good at all. Tasted like an artificial syrup which I didn't expect to be there. What annoyed me was that my burger was served on a tiny board and the bread was super soft that it fell apart after I cut it.	in our case the restaurant was nearly empty and the staff was only waiting for guests  my partner ordered simple gnocchis and i ordered a veggie burger with sweet potato fries  the food was alright but really nothing great  the prices are reasonable and the location is nice  the drink was something with strawberry and tasted not good at all  tasted like an artificial syrup which i didn t expect to be there  what annoyed me was that my burger was served on a tiny board and the bread was super soft that it fell apart after i cut it

My wife has a few food intolerances so we made sure when we went in we explained to the waiter, who then called over the manager who with my wife's help came up with a off the cuff dish which she could eat; which she did! The waiter and manager were very good and attentive to us and made sure we were enjoying the food with me having a pasta dish with squid and octopus which was next level, the two youngest had a pasta bake which they said was ok and my eldest had a burger which I had a nibble of and was lovely and juicy. The quality of food and service are fantastic for the cost if the meal which was £75 with mains, deserts and drinks.	we have eaten at the jamie s italian in manchester before now so had a good idea what value for money we would get  so this is why we chose to eat here  my wife has a few food intolerances so we made sure when we went in we explained to the waiter  who then called over the manager who with my wife s help came up with a off the cuff dish which she could eat  which she did  the waiter and manager were very good and attentive to us and made sure we were enjoying the food with me having a pasta dish with squid and octopus which was next level  the two youngest had a pasta bake which they said was ok and my eldest had a burger which i had a nibble of and was lovely and juicy  the quality of food and service are fantastic for the cost if the meal which was  75 with mains  deserts and drinks

2288	2.0	It pains me to give this restaurant a 2 star rating. I am a fan of Jamie Oliver for a long time since the beginning with Naked Chef. I understand he is a restaurateur and celebrity now and not really a chef cooking anymore. He is just lending his name and brand but holy cow this was a bad experience. The restaurant was under staff and confirmed by our server who was less then trilled to be there. We should have left right then but we were hungry and tired of walking so we stayed. After waiting forever for our wine, then our food, we finally get the bonus of flavorless and tiny pastas. My wife ordered crab pasta - no exaggeration very little crab (see photo). The highlight was the starter scallops, they were very good with great mushy peas. The server did try to save the night by giving us more wine on the house.... But be warned Jamie is not there and the standards are very low.	it pains me to give this restaurant a 2 star rating  i am a fan of jamie oliver for a long time since the beginning with naked chef  i understand he is a restaurateur and celebrity now and not really a chef cooking anymore  he is just lending his name and brand but holy cow this was a bad experience  the restaurant was under staff and confirmed by our server who was less then trilled to be there  we should have left right then but we were hungry and tired of walking so we stayed  after waiting forever for our wine  then our food  we finally get the bonus of flavorless and tiny pastas  my wife ordered crab pasta   no exaggeration very little crab  see photo   the highlight was the starter scallops  they were very good with great mushy peas  the server did try to save the night by giving us more wine on the house     but be warned jamie is not there and the standards are very low

I didn't particularly loved the staring that the people next to us were giving our party... ignorance still exist! :)Anyway... service sucked. My sister ordered about 5 bottles of wine... yet our dinner entrees didn't arrive until it was closing time and mind you, it wasn't packed. The delay time from appetizers to dinner was mind blowing that by the time our food came, we lost our appetite. Oh wait, maybe we lost it because it WAS that bad!It was so bad... I didn't remember the numerous appetizers my sister ordered. I did remember my Honeycomb cannelloni trio for  £11.45 (Aubergine & sun-dried tomato; pumpkin; ricotta & spinach) and it was ECK! It literally tasted like frozen cannelloni. Long story short: don't bother going here. Not worth your gazillion GBP pounds!

However Sally felt we should be put at the worst possible table, where all the servers were storming back and forth with good and empty plates.When we immediately requested for a change on location, she said there is a queue , and we need to wait another 45 mins.After much pleading and requesting, one of their waitstaff Amy, stepped up and took an executive decision to give us a better table.Food was good like always.Thank you Amy!

2291	2.0	Typically Jamie. All the food was either very spicy or very salty. Most of the time, it was a combination of those two. I had the fresh crab spaghetti as main course. Fresh it was! There were still some shell parts on the crab. Yum! Without the fact I tasted barely anything but salt, it was fairly okay. (Don't think I never eat salt, cause I love it. But even for me, this was too much.)We were sat outside on a small table and wooden bench. For such an expensive restaurant, I expected more than that.Waiters were very nice.Cocktails were amazing! Location is okay. You have a perfect view on another restaurant and people walk on and off.	typically jamie  all the food was either very spicy or very salty  most of the time  it was a combination of those two  i had the fresh crab spaghetti as main course  fresh it was  there were still some shell parts on the crab  yum  without the fact i tasted barely anything but salt  it was fairly okay   don t think i never eat salt  cause i love it  but even for me  this was too much  we were sat outside on a small table and wooden bench  for such an expensive restaurant  i expected more than that waiters were very nice cocktails were amazing  location is okay  you have a perfect view on another restaurant and people walk on and off

Nothing too heavy or stodgy, just tasty food, well prepared and presented.Staff were very good, we got there a little before the kitchen closed, but not rushed or pressured. Will definitely go back again.Note there long line normally to get in at regular times, so go after the show and just before closing! you get to walk right in that way.	got too say this was the best italian food i have had in a long while  clean  simple and really fresh  nothing too heavy or stodgy  just tasty food  well prepared and presented staff were very good  we got there a little before the kitchen closed  but not rushed or pressured  will definitely go back again note there long line normally to get in at regular times  so go after the show and just before closing  you get to walk right in that way 
2293	3.0	I visited Jamie's Italian on a busy Saturday lunch time, but we were seated and served vey quickly.The menu isn't huge, but offered enough variety.My mum and I shared a cured meat plank for one, and it was plenty. Our waitress explained the different meats and cheeses, describing the flavours and even recommended we eat one particular meat last so that it's flavour didn't overpower our palates and ruin tasting the other meats, which was a helpful tip.I opted for a delicious sounding special of scallop and truffle spaghetti with prosciutto and leeks. My mum opted for a summer Gorgonzola risotto.Our portions were a good size, but unfortunately I was really disappointed in mine. It was quite oily and tasteless, the spaghetti stuck together and scallops stingy in portion. My mums risotto was tasty but very rich so she couldn't finish it and asked for a box to take half of it home with her. They don't do boxes but our kind waitress did wrap it in a foil parcel for us instead. A mixed experience... Nice service but not the best food. There are certainly better Italian restaurants out there, and at £15.95 for my dish, I certainly left feeling a bit disappointed.	i visited jamie s italian on a busy saturday lunch time  but we were seated and served vey quickly the menu isn t huge  but offered enough variety my mum and i shared a cured meat plank for one  and it was plenty  our waitress explained the different meats and cheeses  describing the flavours and even recommended we eat one particular meat last so that it s flavour didn t overpower our palates and ruin tasting the other meats  which was a helpful tip i opted for a delicious sounding special of scallop and truffle spaghetti with prosciutto and leeks  my mum opted for a summer gorgonzola risotto our portions were a good size  but unfortunately i was really disappointed in mine  it was quite oily and tasteless  the spaghetti stuck together and scallops stingy in portion  my mums risotto was tasty but very rich so she couldn t finish it and asked for a box to take half of it home with her  they don t do boxes but our kind waitress did wrap it in a foil parcel for us instead  a mixed experience    nice service but not the best food  there are certainly better italian restaurants out there  and at  15 95 for my dish  i certainly left feeling a bit disappointed 
2294	3.0	Well, this is the second time I go into one of Jamie´s restaurants and again, I am not really over whelmed. I mean the place is really nice, I like the interior and all, but it is just a bit too expensive for what you get. We had the vegetarian obergines and for 11 Pounds I think you should expect at least a whole eggplant and not just half. Also, the portion of fries was super small, as was the salad. The staff is super nice and the food is ok, but it´s neither very Italian nor very reasonable price wise.	well  this is the second time i go into one of jamie s restaurants and again  i am not really over whelmed  i mean the place is really nice  i like the interior and all  but it is just a bit too expensive for what you get  we had the vegetarian obergines and for 11 pounds i think you should expect at least a whole eggplant and not just half  also  the portion of fries was super small  as was the salad  the staff is super nice and the food is ok  but it s neither very italian nor very reasonable price wise

2299	3.0	Can't find the listing for the Jamie's Italian location we went to which was near st James park so I will post here.Came here for a late dinner with the husband. We got seated fairly quickly with no reservations. There's lots to choose from as the menu is massive. Not thinking about portion sizes we ordered the plank for two, arancini balls, crab and avocado bruschetta, and pancetta carbonara all to share. We also ordered a half carafe of the house wine to share.The plank for two is a pretty good portion of meats and cheeses for two people. I think we should have just ordered that! We were really stuffed after everything! For me there was just too much fried things that filled me up with not a lot of flavor. The arancini balls and I guess the polenta fries that came with the plank were just ok. The bruschetta, was super filling and it was on a huge piece of toast so it was a bit difficult to share. The carbonara was good but I just wanted more sauce and for it to be a bit more flavorful and spicy.All in all the meal was satisfactory. The ambiance was great and our server was very nice to us. He even sat down next to us as we asked for recommendations on what to see and do around the area! Would recommend this place for a solid happy hour choice!	can t find the listing for the jamie s italian location we went to which was near st james park so i will post here came here for a late dinner with the husband  we got seated fairly quickly with no reservations  there s lots to choose from as the menu is massive  not thinking about portion sizes we ordered the plank for two  arancini balls  crab and avocado bruschetta  and pancetta carbonara all to share  we also ordered a half carafe of the house wine to share the plank for two is a pretty good portion of meats and cheeses for two people  i think we should have just ordered that  we were really stuffed after everything  for me there was just too much fried things that filled me up with not a lot of flavor  the arancini balls and i guess the polenta fries that came with the plank were just ok  the bruschetta  was super filling and it was on a huge piece of toast so it was a bit difficult to share  the carbonara was good but i just wanted more sauce and for it to be a bit more flavorful and spicy all in all the meal was satisfactory  the ambiance was great and our server was very nice to us  he even sat down next to us as we asked for recommendations on what to see and do around the area  would recommend this place for a solid happy hour choice 
2300	5.0	I went there just beause I was curios about this Jaimie Oliver everyone talks about (in Italy he is not so famous), having litterally zero expectations.We decided to try the fish and chips and a pizza, just to check if what he says about his ability to cook real Italian cuisine was right.I have to say that both dishes were delicious and the pizza crust was far better than many I have eaten in Italy.I know Jaimie doesn't need my feed back, but here it is: amazing ingredients, very good batter for the fish and chips, potatoes cut by hand, low prices considerng the name and the location... So, it was definitely a good surprise!	i went there just beause i was curios about this jaimie oliver everyone talks about  in italy he is not so famous   having litterally zero expectations we decided to try the fish and chips and a pizza  just to check if what he says about his ability to cook real italian cuisine was right i have to say that both dishes were delicious and the pizza crust was far better than many i have eaten in italy i know jaimie doesn t need my feed back  but here it is  amazing ingredients  very good batter for the fish and chips  potatoes cut by hand  low prices considerng the name and the location    so  it was definitely a good surprise 
2301	5.0	We ate at Jamie's Italian in Budapest, Hungary. Tried to find it on Yelp but I guess the location is too new. They opened in May of 2016? Anyway, spectacular meal. The primavera salad (not a pasta salad, don't be confused!) was the best salad ever! Green goddess dressing over greens and cucumber, green apple, shaved white asparagus?, pea shoots?, and edamame. Pizza for entree. Highly recommend this spot.	we ate at jamie s italian in budapest  hungary  tried to find it on yelp but i guess the location is too new  they opened in may of 2016  anyway  spectacular meal  the primavera salad  not a pasta salad  don t be confused   was the best salad ever  green goddess dressing over greens and cucumber  green apple  shaved white asparagus   pea shoots   and edamame  pizza for entree  highly recommend this spot 
2302	5.0	I don't understand the poor rating this restaurant has been getting. I thought it was great.I did notice a lot of tables ordering chips with their main course, so perhaps the English don't quite get pasta and it's delicious tradition.I had the bolognese which was fabulous. After we had all eaten our various mains I ordered another main for tasting / sharing. It was a spinach and ricotta ravioli. Delicious and a fantastic sauce.Come on England give your countryman the 5 stars he deserves in future ok ?Proper Italian from the naked chef himself.	i don t understand the poor rating this restaurant has been getting  i thought it was great i did notice a lot of tables ordering chips with their main course  so perhaps the english don t quite get pasta and it s delicious tradition i had the bolognese which was fabulous  after we had all eaten our various mains i ordered another main for tasting   sharing  it was a spinach and ricotta ravioli  delicious and a fantastic sauce come on england give your countryman the 5 stars he deserves in future ok  proper italian from the naked chef himself

I don't think you'd bring your Mom here on her birthday but maybe for some lunch before a matinee show. They have a special menu called ""quick and easy"".

2304	3.0	I really wanted to give 5 stars. My dish was exceptional, but the service was not. Our waitress seemed put out by our requests for service and she never checked on us once. I asked for a Diet Coke, never received it, and then it showed up on our final bill. Bad service always makes or breaks the dining experience. We really wanted to try the dessert as well but decided to go somewhere else  based on the service.	i really wanted to give 5 stars  my dish was exceptional  but the service was not  our waitress seemed put out by our requests for service and she never checked on us once  i asked for a diet coke  never received it  and then it showed up on our final bill  bad service always makes or breaks the dining experience  we really wanted to try the dessert as well but decided to go somewhere else  based on the service 
2305	3.0	What i liked: 1. Ambiance (modern & cozy) 2. The Mushroom truffle pastaI ordered the mushroom truffle pasta & polenta chips. I was very disappointed in the polenta chips. No sauce....and too chunky of pieces... like square blocks. Was very plain and too chunky. However the special of the day was absolutely one of my favorite pastas. The truffle oil brought out the mushroom taste and it was delicious. I ate the WHOLE thing. Which is rare. My friend ordered the meat ball with pasta. It was OK... not the best meatballs i've had...they were too herby for me. Ooo...another thing..the waitstaff...not so helpful with recommendations and was a bit unorganized. For example... no plates provided...and a bit all over the place. Maybe she was having a bad day~~ who knows~ I might come back if i have dreams of the mushroom pasta...but maybe not~ Although  my pasta was really good~ was not really impressed with waitstaff~	what i liked  1  ambiance  modern   cozy  2  the mushroom truffle pastai ordered the mushroom truffle pasta   polenta chips  i was very disappointed in the polenta chips  no sauce    and too chunky of pieces    like square blocks  was very plain and too chunky  however the special of the day was absolutely one of my favorite pastas  the truffle oil brought out the mushroom taste and it was delicious  i ate the whole thing  which is rare  my friend ordered the meat ball with pasta  it was ok    not the best meatballs i ve had   they were too herby for me  ooo   another thing  the waitstaff   not so helpful with recommendations and was a bit unorganized  for example    no plates provided   and a bit all over the place  maybe she was having a bad day   who knows  i might come back if i have dreams of the mushroom pasta   but maybe not  although  my pasta was really good  was not really impressed with waitstaff

Played it safe with a hamburger for dinner and got two ""Olive on Ice"" apps prior. Nothing was a let down from the service to the food.

2308	4.0	"This place always has a pretty long wait but I managed to get a table on a Wednesday night within 15 min (checked in at 7pm, got a table by 7:15pm). The inside of this restaurant is quite nice and I like the comforting and welcoming atmosphere. They offer ""appetizer"" and ""entree"" sizes for most of their pasta dishes, which is pretty unique and very helpful if you're not that hungry and don't want to spend too much on dinner.That being said, while the crab and avocado bruschetta was really good-the crab was really fresh and flavorful-it was a really small portion for the price of 7 pounds. It was worth it because of the great contrasting flavors and textures of the smooth avocado paste, juicy shredded crab meat, crunchy sourdough and ribbons of green apple. My friend ordered the smaller version of the pasta pomodoro, which was pretty good (tomato sauce was fresh with lots of tomatoes, parmesan was quality and added cheesiness), it tasted like most other pasta dishes that I've had in the past. I did however really enjoy how the pasta was al dente, it seems that the pasta in Europe is cooked for less time than in the US, leaving them firmer and in my opinion, more enjoyable to eat. The small plate was 6.25 pounds.After I finished the bruschetta I was still a little hungry so we ordered the bread which came on a plank. There were 4 types, but my favorites were the foccacia and the sourdough. It came with olive and sundried tomato tapenades which was very tasty and complemented the bread well. The only problem I had with the bread was that a fairly small portion cost 4 pounds which is kind of ridiculous considering that it's just bread.Overall, would definitely recommend this place for a reasonably priced dinner if you're not too hungry. Next time I want to try the cheesecake dessert which looked amazing! I'll be back to try a seafood pasta dish, which sounded really delicious!"	this place always has a pretty long wait but i managed to get a table on a wednesday night within 15 min  checked in at 7pm  got a table by 7 15pm   the inside of this restaurant is quite nice and i like the comforting and welcoming atmosphere  they offer  appetizer  and  entree  sizes for most of their pasta dishes  which is pretty unique and very helpful if you re not that hungry and don t want to spend too much on dinner that being said  while the crab and avocado bruschetta was really good the crab was really fresh and flavorful it was a really small portion for the price of 7 pounds  it was worth it because of the great contrasting flavors and textures of the smooth avocado paste  juicy shredded crab meat  crunchy sourdough and ribbons of green apple  my friend ordered the smaller version of the pasta pomodoro  which was pretty good  tomato sauce was fresh with lots of tomatoes  parmesan was quality and added cheesiness   it tasted like most other pasta dishes that i ve had in the past  i did however really enjoy how the pasta was al dente  it seems that the pasta in europe is cooked for less time than in the us  leaving them firmer and in my opinion  more enjoyable to eat  the small plate was 6 25 pounds after i finished the bruschetta i was still a little hungry so we ordered the bread which came on a plank  there were 4 types  but my favorites were the foccacia and the sourdough  it came with olive and sundried tomato tapenades which was very tasty and complemented the bread well  the only problem i had with the bread was that a fairly small portion cost 4 pounds which is kind of ridiculous considering that it s just bread overall  would definitely recommend this place for a reasonably priced dinner if you re not too hungry  next time i want to try the cheesecake dessert which looked amazing  i ll be back to try a seafood pasta dish  which sounded really delicious

Meals were timed to perfection, didn't really have to wait for very long in between courses. The plank of starters were presented beautifully. My main which was the steak was cooked beautifully medium rare. It was tasty, well seasoned and delicious. My partner had the Porchetta, which was made into a Christmas dream, great cut of pork served with apples and in season vegetables. Ended off the meal with meringue and a chocolate cake. It was perfect. Now I know why, they always sell out of this menu. Thanks for the amazing dinner. Till next year.

Right next to covent garden, place is really nice, wood and big lamps, big tables, very cozy; we had lunch with friends, bette remake a reservation if you don´t want to wait! but you can always wait at the bar as we did. On the ordering side, I think everything is just delicious there is no going wrong here, we ordered everything to share to try it all. I personally had the wild mushroom cilindretti pasta pillows which where really good, starter wise there was a big mix starting with the bread basket, the filled cherry tomatoes, big taster plate among other things... service is great and prices are not bad at all.	i was really hyped about going to one of my favorite chef s places  i love his recipes so i just had to go  was also afraid of being disappointed but this was not the case  right next to covent garden  place is really nice  wood and big lamps  big tables  very cozy  we had lunch with friends  bette remake a reservation if you don t want to wait  but you can always wait at the bar as we did  on the ordering side  i think everything is just delicious there is no going wrong here  we ordered everything to share to try it all  i personally had the wild mushroom cilindretti pasta pillows which where really good  starter wise there was a big mix starting with the bread basket  the filled cherry tomatoes  big taster plate among other things    service is great and prices are not bad at all 
2313	1.0	This place was such a disappointment. I went here for lunch on a Saturday while in London and wish I would have picked anything else. One star because:1. The service was terrible. After we got seated, it took 20 min to even get waters and s menu.  The waitress was unapologetic for the wait  2. The food was sub par. I got the crab spaghetti and it was over salted. I had to request cheese and pepper for my pasta. The waitress was again unapologetic and it was an attitude like she was doing me a favor. 3. The price was not worth the quality of food or service provided. This place should be ashamed of the service it provided and the quality of food it served. There are many other great restaurants to pick from in the area (in fact, Dishoom which is right next door to this place is amazing).  Save yourself time and frustration and go elsewhere.	this place was such a disappointment  i went here for lunch on a saturday while in london and wish i would have picked anything else  one star because 1  the service was terrible  after we got seated  it took 20 min to even get waters and s menu   the waitress was unapologetic for the wait  2  the food was sub par  i got the crab spaghetti and it was over salted  i had to request cheese and pepper for my pasta  the waitress was again unapologetic and it was an attitude like she was doing me a favor  3  the price was not worth the quality of food or service provided  this place should be ashamed of the service it provided and the quality of food it served  there are many other great restaurants to pick from in the area  in fact  dishoom which is right next door to this place is amazing    save yourself time and frustration and go elsewhere

Ate one quarter of it and when waiter came to collect our plates he jyst said oh its filling isn't it rather than ask why wr didnt eat it. We then told him it just wasnt nice and he completely ignored it and proceeded to give us our bill. So so badly handled. The location is very nice backing on to a courtyard with other nice eateries and shops.	werent sat where we asked to be  ordered superfiod salad with chicken  came without chicken and when it did arrived it was the grizzly bits  ate one quarter of it and when waiter came to collect our plates he jyst said oh its filling isn t it rather than ask why wr didnt eat it  we then told him it just wasnt nice and he completely ignored it and proceeded to give us our bill  so so badly handled  the location is very nice backing on to a courtyard with other nice eateries and shops

2317	4.0	American tourists, wandering around Covent Garden, looking for a place to eat. Stumbled upong Jamie's Italian. Since my companion has a huge man-crush on the guy, we had to eat there.Busy for an early week day evening. Bonus that the buzzers have a far enough radius for you to stroll a bi while you wait. Front desk and bar staff were pleasant and efficient. Our server seemed a bit distracted but no harm no foul. FIrst course (veggie platter and crispy polenta) was delish. Main course - mushroom ravioli were great. Truffle risotto - meh. The rice wasn't cooked and it tasted more of olive oil than truffle. Dessert was tastey though - pana cotta and brownie. If the risotto was my only experience, I wouldn't be a fan. But everything else more than made up for it. I only wish I lived closer so I could try something else to redeem my rating.	american tourists  wandering around covent garden  looking for a place to eat  stumbled upong jamie s italian  since my companion has a huge man crush on the guy  we had to eat there busy for an early week day evening  bonus that the buzzers have a far enough radius for you to stroll a bi while you wait  front desk and bar staff were pleasant and efficient  our server seemed a bit distracted but no harm no foul  first course  veggie platter and crispy polenta  was delish  main course   mushroom ravioli were great  truffle risotto   meh  the rice wasn t cooked and it tasted more of olive oil than truffle  dessert was tastey though   pana cotta and brownie  if the risotto was my only experience  i wouldn t be a fan  but everything else more than made up for it  i only wish i lived closer so i could try something else to redeem my rating 
2318	1.0	"Please check the waiter's name, if you want to dine here.  If you happen to sit in the area where ""Sebastia"" will serve, please ask for another table.  We had a wonderful dining experience when we visited Jamie's Italian 2 years ago. So this time, we made the reservation when we just arrived in London. He paid no attention to us when he took our order.  He came over to our table and asked us what we wanted, so we told him the dishes we wanted to order. However, he kept looking somewhere else and murmuring to himself WHILE taking our orders. We had to repeat our order three times! When we asked him what he was doing, he answered ""nothing"" and continued looking into the distance and murmuring to himself. His action was extremely rude and showed how much he really ""cared"" about his customers.  Also, when I placed my order with ""artisan bread basket"", he tried to force me to order garlic bread twice.  He finally stopped trying when I said ""I just want artisan bread basket and I don't fancy garlic bread.""  While we were dining, he never greeted us like other waiters usually did.  He just stood in front of a station and chatted with his friend (not worker at Jamie's kitchen) right next to our table. At the time, we decided that we wanted to leave without dessert because of his poor service.  When he returned with the change (I paid cash), he didn't even say ""thank you,"" just ""here ya go."" We decided to request correct change when we found out it was short with 5 pence.  After we told him, he blamed us for paying with cash and even made up excuses like ""oh I don't have 5 pence"" and ""I asked all of my colleague and they don't have 5 pence."" Don't get me wrong, 5 pence is very little money, but the fact that he didn't tell us beforehand and started blaming us instead was unacceptable. He treated us like beggars when he gave the 5 pence back. On the way out of the restaurant, we decided to tell the manager of the restaurant about his unacceptably poor service and rude attitude.  Even though we got the money back, we were outraged and our good memory of this place was totally gone.

2321	2.0	I have been living in London for almost 4 years now and I always tried to avoid 'tourists' restaurants such as Zizzi, Hard Rock Café, Prezzo, Carluccio's, Angus Steakhouse...(and even Starbucks!) because I prefer to give my money to a smaller company that pays more attention to customer and offers better quality food.I went only once to a Jamie Oliver's restaurants : it was in 2013, I went to his new restaurant Jamie Oliver's Diner and I didn't like it (burnt and dry burgers with soggy fries).  Since then, my parents went for diner to Jamie's Fifteen in Amsterdam and had a lovely time. Only fools do not change their minds...so my boyfriend and I went to lunch at Jamie's Italian on a Saturday, the place was packed with families and couples - surprisingly mostly English people (not that many tourists!) Both hungover, we decided to start our meal with two non-alcoholic cocktails, both were good and very refreshing. As starters we shared crispy porcini mushroom arancini and the special starter of the day: scallops served with peas and bacon. Both of us enjoyed the arancini, they were great even if I thought they could have been a bit more creamy inside and more crispy on the outside.The arrabbiata was really tasty and full of flavour. The second starter was just ok but a bit bland, nothing really special about scallops with mushy peas, a slice of crispy bacon and breadcrumbs especially if you could hardly taste the scallops! My boyfriend and I were a bit disappointed by the size of the scallops, they were very tiny, same size as the one you can find in Tesco! The dish was around £8.50, which I think is totally overpriced considering the tiny size of the scallops. For mains, we decided to play the adventurous card, we both ordered from the special boards. My boyfriend had the homemade pasta dish with cumberland sausage and I had the special fish dish. His pasta dish was very good. It tasted fresh and light, the yellow pepper sauce was the highlight of this dish and tasted very summery. My dish was a sustainable tuna sliced steak, the whole dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the tuna was pink in the middle as I like it, and asparagus were a bit crunchy. I didn't like the cold truffle potatoes and I think it didn't add anything to the dish. To compliment our mains, we had some polenta chips on the side. They were perfect, light and cripsy. Only bad thing is that they arrived 10 minutes after our main dishes. It was a nice experience but nothing exceptional. Some dishes were a bit bland and overpriced in my opinion for what they were, special mains were both good but I think it could be easy to find something similar for cheaper elsewhere in central London. Overall I just felt the food was a bit average and not anything over the top. We had a great service, we didn't wait too much time between dishes apart from our side, which is not too bad considering the restaurant was full.  Even if this recent experience has been better than my Jamie Oliver's Diner memories, I am afraid my opinion hasn't change a lot, I don't think I will become a Jamie's Oliver restaurant fan soon. I will stick only to his TV shows, which I like.	i have been living in london for almost 4 years now and i always tried to avoid  tourists  restaurants such as zizzi  hard rock caf   prezzo  carluccio s  angus steakhouse    and even starbucks   because i prefer to give my money to a smaller company that pays more attention to customer and offers better quality food i went only once to a jamie oliver s restaurants   it was in 2013  i went to his new restaurant jamie oliver s diner and i didn t like it  burnt and dry burgers with soggy fries    since then  my parents went for diner to jamie s fifteen in amsterdam and had a lovely time  only fools do not change their minds   so my boyfriend and i went to lunch at jamie s italian on a saturday  the place was packed with families and couples   surprisingly mostly english people  not that many tourists   both hungover  we decided to start our meal with two non alcoholic cocktails  both were good and very refreshing  as starters we shared crispy porcini mushroom arancini and the special starter of the day  scallops served with peas and bacon  both of us enjoyed the arancini  they were great even if i thought they could have been a bit more creamy inside and more crispy on the outside the arrabbiata was really tasty and full of flavour  the second starter was just ok but a bit bland  nothing really special about scallops with mushy peas  a slice of crispy bacon and breadcrumbs especially if you could hardly taste the scallops  my boyfriend and i were a bit disappointed by the size of the scallops  they were very tiny  same size as the one you can find in tesco  the dish was around  8 50  which i think is totally overpriced considering the tiny size of the scallops  for mains  we decided to play the adventurous card  we both ordered from the special boards  my boyfriend had the homemade pasta dish with cumberland sausage and i had the special fish dish  his pasta dish was very good  it tasted fresh and light  the yellow pepper sauce was the highlight of this dish and tasted very summery  my dish was a sustainable tuna sliced steak  the whole dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned  the tuna was pink in the middle as i like it  and asparagus were a bit crunchy  i didn t like the cold truffle potatoes and i think it didn t add anything to the dish  to compliment our mains  we had some polenta chips on the side  they were perfect  light and cripsy  only bad thing is that they arrived 10 minutes after our main dishes  it was a nice experience but nothing exceptional  some dishes were a bit bland and overpriced in my opinion for what they were  special mains were both good but i think it could be easy to find something similar for cheaper elsewhere in central london  overall i just felt the food was a bit average and not anything over the top  we had a great service  we didn t wait too much time between dishes apart from our side  which is not too bad considering the restaurant was full   even if this recent experience has been better than my jamie oliver s diner memories  i am afraid my opinion hasn t change a lot  i don t think i will become a jamie s oliver restaurant fan soon  i will stick only to his tv shows  which i like 
2322	4.0	Lovely spot near to all the theatres. After bad experiences at the Manchester branch I was pleasantly surprised by the service and food. After asking if the caprese salad had any garlic in and the waiter saying no, he then went and double checked with the chef who actually said the tomatoes were marinated in a garlic oil.. This small extra mile massively stands out. It was lunchtime so I went with the mozzarella, melon and Parma ham salad minus the pesto dressing. It was really delicious and much more filling than I expected. We had skinny fries and polenta chips to share - not sure about the latter, perhaps an acquired taste?! Only 4 stars as the non alcoholic ginger mojito really just tasted like limeade and was a bit disappointing for the extra pennies spent on it. The restaurant is bigger than you think with plenty of seating downstairs too.	lovely spot near to all the theatres  after bad experiences at the manchester branch i was pleasantly surprised by the service and food  after asking if the caprese salad had any garlic in and the waiter saying no  he then went and double checked with the chef who actually said the tomatoes were marinated in a garlic oil   this small extra mile massively stands out  it was lunchtime so i went with the mozzarella  melon and parma ham salad minus the pesto dressing  it was really delicious and much more filling than i expected  we had skinny fries and polenta chips to share   not sure about the latter  perhaps an acquired taste   only 4 stars as the non alcoholic ginger mojito really just tasted like limeade and was a bit disappointing for the extra pennies spent on it  the restaurant is bigger than you think with plenty of seating downstairs too

I came here spontaneously with a friend, they gave us a beeper that would give us notice when a table was free and after 10min we already had one for two. We ate pasta and some antipasti and had to wait for it ca. 20min which was alright as the restaurant was crowded. Luckily we ordered enough food because from the main dish alone, I didn't feel full. The staff is friendly and attentive, so there's nothing to complain about.	i ve always wanted to try out this restaurant and wasn t disappointed  the prices are moderate  the service is very good and the food tastes delicious  i came here spontaneously with a friend  they gave us a beeper that would give us notice when a table was free and after 10min we already had one for two  we ate pasta and some antipasti and had to wait for it ca  20min which was alright as the restaurant was crowded  luckily we ordered enough food because from the main dish alone  i didn t feel full  the staff is friendly and attentive  so there s nothing to complain about

2327	1.0	"Worst Italian food in London, hands down.My fist Yelp review, and I've been using Yelp for years. Wanted to add my voice to those warning people away from this place.I had a reasonable amount of respect for Jamie Oliver. I've learned a few things from his cooking shows. Thought his campaigning for better school food was a noble one. And Fifteen, his original restaurant, was my go to place to entertain friends visiting London. Had many very satisfying, reasonably priced meals there... until something changed a couple of years ago. Tables were crammed in, menu changed to tapas everything, prices raised, and I was asked where I was from about 5 times from the staff. Needless to say, the food quality and overall experience plummeted, and the bill doubled. Haven't been back, and became sceptical of his other establishments multiplying across the city.My family was in the Covent Garden area for my daughter's birthday a few weeks ago. My wife suggested we try Jamie's Italian for dinner, as she heard that it was good for kids. I reluctantly agreed. After about a 25 minute wait (at 5:15 on a Thursday), we were seated. We all ordered pasta, myself a meatball pappardelle, for my daughter a ""cheesy pasta bake"" (which was described as having an ""organic seven-veg tomato sauce"").Cooked ground meat that has been defrosted in the microwave gets a dry rubberiness. This is exactly the texture of the meatballs with my pasta. The pasta was also quite dry, and I believe the chef forgot to include flavour with the dish, as it had none. Typically I will eat what is in front of me. I couldn't eat this. To his credit, the waiter noticed that my meal wasn't being eaten. Out of character, I gave him my full opinion of the dish. He offered to replace it. I ordered a different pasta. It was better, but no better than a cheap sauce out of a jar. This is the very first time I've had a meal sent back. It was that bad.My daughter's meal was also a disaster. She just picked at it and wasn't all that interested in  it. I tried it, the pasta was well done, and the dish had no flavour. There was no cheesy crust, no sauce, no colour. It appeared to be just a bowl of fusilli.  I asked the waiter about the cheese part of the cheesy pasta bake, and he explained that it was a sauce mixed in. If this was true, there was very little of it, and it was flavourless. This bland, mushy, beige dish, with zero nutritional value, is exactly the type of rubbish that Mr. Oliver was working at having removed from the plates of children at school. Here it is on the plates of his establishment. I understand that Jamie Oliver is very busy and likely has little involvement in this restaurant, but considering how bad this was, I would say his involvement is about as close to Ronald McDonald's involvement in the kitchen flipping burgers...none. Mr. Oliver should be horrified that his name is associated with this place. Upon exiting, there were about 20 people waiting for tables. Likely all tourists basing their dining decision on the name. They won't be back, neither will we."	worst italian food in london  hands down my fist yelp review  and i ve been using yelp for years  wanted to add my voice to those warning people away from this place i had a reasonable amount of respect for jamie oliver  i ve learned a few things from his cooking shows  thought his campaigning for better school food was a noble one  and fifteen  his original restaurant  was my go to place to entertain friends visiting london  had many very satisfying  reasonably priced meals there    until something changed a couple of years ago  tables were crammed in  menu changed to tapas everything  prices raised  and i was asked where i was from about 5 times from the staff  needless to say  the food quality and overall experience plummeted  and the bill doubled  haven t been back  and became sceptical of his other establishments multiplying across the city my family was in the covent garden area for my daughter s birthday a few weeks ago  my wife suggested we try jamie s italian for dinner  as she heard that it was good for kids  i reluctantly agreed  after about a 25 minute wait  at 5 15 on a thursday   we were seated  we all ordered pasta  myself a meatball pappardelle  for my daughter a  cheesy pasta bake   which was described as having an  organic seven veg tomato sauce   cooked ground meat that has been defrosted in the microwave gets a dry rubberiness  this is exactly the texture of the meatballs with my pasta  the pasta was also quite dry  and i believe the chef forgot to include flavour with the dish  as it had none  typically i will eat what is in front of me  i couldn t eat this  to his credit  the waiter noticed that my meal wasn t being eaten  out of character  i gave him my full opinion of the dish  he offered to replace it  i ordered a different pasta  it was better  but no better than a cheap sauce out of a jar  this is the very first time i ve had a meal sent back  it was that bad my daughter s meal was also a disaster  she just picked at it and wasn t all that interested in  it  i tried it  the pasta was well done  and the dish had no flavour  there was no cheesy crust  no sauce  no colour  it appeared to be just a bowl of fusilli   i asked the waiter about the cheese part of the cheesy pasta bake  and he explained that it was a sauce mixed in  if this was true  there was very little of it  and it was flavourless  this bland  mushy  beige dish  with zero nutritional value  is exactly the type of rubbish that mr  oliver was working at having removed from the plates of children at school  here it is on the plates of his establishment  i understand that jamie oliver is very busy and likely has little involvement in this restaurant  but considering how bad this was  i would say his involvement is about as close to ronald mcdonald s involvement in the kitchen flipping burgers   none  mr  oliver should be horrified that his name is associated with this place  upon exiting  there were about 20 people waiting for tables  likely all tourists basing their dining decision on the name  they won t be back  neither will we

Also 100% recommend joining the Gold Club: you often get discounts and today, I got a free glass of wine plus some heavenly mushroom fritters.	i m a long term fan of jamie s and today was no exception  amazing sausage ragu  if a little on the spicy side  also 100  recommend joining the gold club  you often get discounts and today  i got a free glass of wine plus some heavenly mushroom fritters 
2329	2.0	It was way too expensive for what we got. Our server was rarely there to help us and we literally had to ask another server to bring us our drinks because we could see them sitting on the bar for 10 minutes before we even got them. Not worth the money based on the service alone. The food was ok, and again not worth the money.	it was way too expensive for what we got  our server was rarely there to help us and we literally had to ask another server to bring us our drinks because we could see them sitting on the bar for 10 minutes before we even got them  not worth the money based on the service alone  the food was ok  and again not worth the money 
2330	2.0	Jamie--Really? Andrew Zimmern would be ashamed. On the upside--pleasant atmosphere with an adequate wine list and fine cocktails.  When they didn't deliver them to another table. As far as food goes  pasta entrees were tasty but had some undercooked pasta .. Other entrees were bland but edible.On the downside --rude wait staff , slow service , our cueball waiter was more interested in chumming with the other waiters then waiting on our table -- he had mastered the art of eye rolling at the patrons of the restaurant . Would not recommend this to anyone .   Try Dishoon next door even though it has a line .	jamie  really  andrew zimmern would be ashamed  on the upside  pleasant atmosphere with an adequate wine list and fine cocktails   when they didn t deliver them to another table  as far as food goes  pasta entrees were tasty but had some undercooked pasta    other entrees were bland but edible on the downside   rude wait staff   slow service   our cueball waiter was more interested in chumming with the other waiters then waiting on our table    he had mastered the art of eye rolling at the patrons of the restaurant   would not recommend this to anyone     try dishoon next door even though it has a line  
2331	1.0	Basic food really ! Not half as yummy looking in person as his dishes on TV!! I had the crab spaghettini which was nice but nothing to rave about! I also had the crispy squid which was rather bland to be honest.... For dessert I chose the brownie option which looked like heaven but was very mediocre .. The. Ice cream on it was nice but the brownie itself was too dark and not tasty enough! It wasn't clean enough there which I'm guessing he claims  is the rustic  look but when your seats aren't clean enough then that's not rustic at all that's just dirt...

2333	3.0	My husband and I were in London on vacation and we met up with an old friend here for dinner. The restaurant is unassuming from the outside, but HUGE on the inside - there have to be at least 3 levels, maybe 4. It felt a little Rain Forrest Cafe to me, which I don't consider a compliment. We didn't do any apps or wine, just went straight for the entrees. I had the vegetable rotolo al forno and my husband had the sausage papardelle. Both were fine. My dish was supposed to have pumpkin in it, but I feel like there was almost none to be found, which is sad because that's one of the main reasons I ordered the dish. Other than that it was pretty tasty.Overall, this place was ok. If I were back in London I'd go somewhere else for dinner.	my husband and i were in london on vacation and we met up with an old friend here for dinner  the restaurant is unassuming from the outside  but huge on the inside   there have to be at least 3 levels  maybe 4  it felt a little rain forrest cafe to me  which i don t consider a compliment  we didn t do any apps or wine  just went straight for the entrees  i had the vegetable rotolo al forno and my husband had the sausage papardelle  both were fine  my dish was supposed to have pumpkin in it  but i feel like there was almost none to be found  which is sad because that s one of the main reasons i ordered the dish  other than that it was pretty tasty overall  this place was ok  if i were back in london i d go somewhere else for dinner 
2334	3.0	A very nice restaurant but expensive for the portions you got. I ordered the Italian nachos which tasted like fried noodles from a Chinese restaurant with guacamole on them. They were interesting. I also got a dish of ricotta with parmesan and garlic on it. The ricotta was in balls. I ordered the larger portion which wasn't very much. It was tasty though. I tired to get the lemon cheesecake for desert but they were out and instead got raspberry desert. It was okay but nothing great. The restaurant is smack dab in the theater district at a prime location and has outdoor seating.	a very nice restaurant but expensive for the portions you got  i ordered the italian nachos which tasted like fried noodles from a chinese restaurant with guacamole on them  they were interesting  i also got a dish of ricotta with parmesan and garlic on it  the ricotta was in balls  i ordered the larger portion which wasn t very much  it was tasty though  i tired to get the lemon cheesecake for desert but they were out and instead got raspberry desert  it was okay but nothing great  the restaurant is smack dab in the theater district at a prime location and has outdoor seating 
2335	2.0	We came here on a busy weekend evening around 6pm to beat the rush.  No wait for a party of 2, wooo!Having said that, the food was just so so.  Starting from the top: Polenta chips = pretty good, big chunks of polenta deep fried with deep fried rosemary.  It wasn't salted soon after frying, however, so none of the salt stuck to the polenta cubes.  Leg of lamb = interesting.  You expect something that looks like a leg, but you get something that looks like a giant fruit roll up.  The mint is almost overpoweringly sweet, and takes some getting used to.  The lamb was well-cooked.Squid ink pasta = skip.  There is a difference between al dente and underdone.  It's almost impossible to undercook fresh pasta, but they did manage to do it.  If fresh pasta normally takes 2 minutes to cook, my dish had just hit the 1 minute mark.  Also, I estimate that there was one scallop on the plate in total (it had been sliced ultra thin).  For the price, this dish was a total rip-off (the lamb is a good value in comparison).  Minted peas = skip.  Again, undercooked.  They would have been better raw rather than in this inbetween state.  Also, there was hardly any mint.  How can you have minted peas with a mint garnish (but no mint in the peas)?  Service:  Unclear who was serving us, and we had to flag people down for water.  Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is cute, but there are better options in Covent Garden.	we came here on a busy weekend evening around 6pm to beat the rush   no wait for a party of 2  wooo having said that  the food was just so so   starting from the top  polenta chips   pretty good  big chunks of polenta deep fried with deep fried rosemary   it wasn t salted soon after frying  however  so none of the salt stuck to the polenta cubes   leg of lamb   interesting   you expect something that looks like a leg  but you get something that looks like a giant fruit roll up   the mint is almost overpoweringly sweet  and takes some getting used to   the lamb was well cooked squid ink pasta   skip   there is a difference between al dente and underdone   it s almost impossible to undercook fresh pasta  but they did manage to do it   if fresh pasta normally takes 2 minutes to cook  my dish had just hit the 1 minute mark   also  i estimate that there was one scallop on the plate in total  it had been sliced ultra thin    for the price  this dish was a total rip off  the lamb is a good value in comparison    minted peas   skip   again  undercooked   they would have been better raw rather than in this inbetween state   also  there was hardly any mint   how can you have minted peas with a mint garnish  but no mint in the peas    service   unclear who was serving us  and we had to flag people down for water   don t get me wrong  the restaurant is cute  but there are better options in covent garden 
2336	3.0	We were there before 7 pm and waited for 40 minutes to get inside. Though when we were leaving half past 8, there wasn't any queue, so obviously the queue depends on the time of day ;)I ordered a rabbit, it turned out to be a good choice, though a little bit too salty for my liking.For the dessert, I had a tiramisu, which wasn't an actual Italian tiramisu, as there wasn't enough cream filling. It was quite tasty, but left me disappointed.The prices are reasonable.	we were there before 7 pm and waited for 40 minutes to get inside  though when we were leaving half past 8  there wasn t any queue  so obviously the queue depends on the time of day   i ordered a rabbit  it turned out to be a good choice  though a little bit too salty for my liking for the dessert  i had a tiramisu  which wasn t an actual italian tiramisu  as there wasn t enough cream filling  it was quite tasty  but left me disappointed the prices are reasonable

2338	3.0	"The wait time here is absolutely absurd. Don't arrive really hungry! Luckily I wasn't and I was also wearing 3 layers to protect myself against the chilly August weather as we had a drink outside. I've been to Jamie's Italian in Kingston and wasn't that impressed but here we had some tasty starters that arrived very quickly - nice squid, fun ravioli ""nachos"" and arancini. I picked the prawn linguine as my main as it's my sister's favourite dish to cook from Jamie Oliver's cookbook and was again pleasantly surprised - really liked the fennel element. The pasta was super al dente, either I've been getting it really wrong or it was slightly undercooked, but it worked well. The desserts weren't so good - I tried both the lemon slice and the tiramisu and wasn't too fond of either. The orange mascarpone in the tiramisu overwhelmed the other flavours and the lemon slice just had too many things going on for my taste - I thought just the mint would have been the perfect complement, without the pistachios and berries.We had an extremely enthusiastic server who did a good job but honestly, we would have tipped her well without all the chat. However, nice to see someone enjoying their work!Despite the relatively good experience, I can't bring myself to give it four stars. There's much better food in this area (well, in Soho) and to wait this long and pay these prices for what is essentially a chain restaurant is probably going to leave a lot of people somewhat aggrieved. However, with better desserts, I might stop trying to be cool and call myself a fan."	the wait time here is absolutely absurd  don t arrive really hungry  luckily i wasn t and i was also wearing 3 layers to protect myself against the chilly august weather as we had a drink outside  i ve been to jamie s italian in kingston and wasn t that impressed but here we had some tasty starters that arrived very quickly   nice squid  fun ravioli  nachos  and arancini  i picked the prawn linguine as my main as it s my sister s favourite dish to cook from jamie oliver s cookbook and was again pleasantly surprised   really liked the fennel element  the pasta was super al dente  either i ve been getting it really wrong or it was slightly undercooked  but it worked well  the desserts weren t so good   i tried both the lemon slice and the tiramisu and wasn t too fond of either  the orange mascarpone in the tiramisu overwhelmed the other flavours and the lemon slice just had too many things going on for my taste   i thought just the mint would have been the perfect complement  without the pistachios and berries we had an extremely enthusiastic server who did a good job but honestly  we would have tipped her well without all the chat  however  nice to see someone enjoying their work despite the relatively good experience  i can t bring myself to give it four stars  there s much better food in this area  well  in soho  and to wait this long and pay these prices for what is essentially a chain restaurant is probably going to leave a lot of people somewhat aggrieved  however  with better desserts  i might stop trying to be cool and call myself a fan

2340	2.0	Very similar experience to Mary v. It took forever to call the waiter over and the food was only okay. I ordered the ricotta bruschetta which tasted like top the tater on a piece of bread with tomatoes that were not fresh. The rocket side salad was much better and the bruschetta was almost double the price. The turkey was large, but needed more seasoning and was very dry. I would skip this next time and try something else.	very similar experience to mary v  it took forever to call the waiter over and the food was only okay  i ordered the ricotta bruschetta which tasted like top the tater on a piece of bread with tomatoes that were not fresh  the rocket side salad was much better and the bruschetta was almost double the price  the turkey was large  but needed more seasoning and was very dry  i would skip this next time and try something else 
2341	5.0	I'm a Food Revolution ambassador and thus Jamie fan - you gotta have cojones to take on US school food, which is coupled with Monsanto and other food demons (the USDA) - so was excited to try one of his restaurants. I was NOT disappointed! The portions were on the generous side, especially the tender, flavorful mixed grill (various game). The house red was a treat - it's Spanish, and probably the best house wine I have ever had - and the cocktail list was creative. I avoid gluten and the waitress, also gluten free, was extremely helpful in highlighting the plentiful GF options...I didn't even have to ask, as she offered. We sat in the back corner in the basement and it was cozy and casual, empty when we got there (5pm, super early as we were going to a show) and it filled up fast. Reservations for parties of 6+ only.

2343	3.0	I tend to agree with another Yelper that based upon our experience here - Jamie Oliver might be spread a little thin.  Here were the ups and downs of our dinner to help you decide if it's for you.- Service needs a bit of improvement:  I'm a Jamie Oliver fan, so was excited when a friend made reservations for us to meet up here.  We arrived on time, and were seated maybe 10 mins. after.  The waitress took another 15 mins. to notice us - after she served folks seated after and next to us first. Everytime we needed something from her we tried new ways of attracting her attention (seemed more interested in hanging out by the water station chatting with her colleagues).- Ambiance is fine, but this place is decievingly huge.  They've nicely broken all that space into separate dining room areas to make it seem more intimate.  Each room felt like it had it's own vibe.  I liked being in the back room, the one downstairs also looked nice.- Food was a mixed bag. Starters of fried squid and bruschetta were ok - not memorable.  I had the mussels and squid ink pasta - which was phenomenal and 5-star worthy and would RECOMMEND.  My companion has their signature prawn pasta dish. Though the flavor was good, the pasta was gummy (like maybe it'd been overcooked, or wasn't fresh - we couldn't decide what the problem was other than it was a big, mushy gooey consistency).  This really stood out in contrast to mine.- Prices were reasonable for what you received.BOTTOM LINE: OK experience to say I tried it. Think it showed the potential to be far better than it is. Wouldn't be on my list to go back to again.	i tend to agree with another yelper that based upon our experience here   jamie oliver might be spread a little thin   here were the ups and downs of our dinner to help you decide if it s for you   service needs a bit of improvement   i m a jamie oliver fan  so was excited when a friend made reservations for us to meet up here   we arrived on time  and were seated maybe 10 mins  after   the waitress took another 15 mins  to notice us   after she served folks seated after and next to us first  everytime we needed something from her we tried new ways of attracting her attention  seemed more interested in hanging out by the water station chatting with her colleagues    ambiance is fine  but this place is decievingly huge   they ve nicely broken all that space into separate dining room areas to make it seem more intimate   each room felt like it had it s own vibe   i liked being in the back room  the one downstairs also looked nice   food was a mixed bag  starters of fried squid and bruschetta were ok   not memorable   i had the mussels and squid ink pasta   which was phenomenal and 5 star worthy and would recommend   my companion has their signature prawn pasta dish  though the flavor was good  the pasta was gummy  like maybe it d been overcooked  or wasn t fresh   we couldn t decide what the problem was other than it was a big  mushy gooey consistency    this really stood out in contrast to mine   prices were reasonable for what you received bottom line  ok experience to say i tried it  think it showed the potential to be far better than it is  wouldn t be on my list to go back to again 
2344	4.0	For my one year anniversary in London I figured I should go somewhere a bit nice, a bit London, a bit special. Unfortunately a dental affliction meant I was limited to the softer side of the food pyramid so I decided not to blow massive cash on food I couldn't chew properly and went with soft, safe, Italian.There was a bit of a wait (30 minutes), and not a lot of room at the bar, but it wasn't altogether unexpected on a Friday night so no big deal. We got taken downstairs to basically the perfect table - corner booths for the win!We ordered the meat board for two as a starter, carbonara and lasagna for the mains. Everything was tasty, looked great on the plate and considering how busy the restaurant was, the service was fast too. It wasn't the best carbonara I've ever had, but the lasagna was amazing.I wish I could say that I got dessert as well, but I thought the menu was a bit boring so gave it a miss.	for my one year anniversary in london i figured i should go somewhere a bit nice  a bit london  a bit special  unfortunately a dental affliction meant i was limited to the softer side of the food pyramid so i decided not to blow massive cash on food i couldn t chew properly and went with soft  safe  italian there was a bit of a wait  30 minutes   and not a lot of room at the bar  but it wasn t altogether unexpected on a friday night so no big deal  we got taken downstairs to basically the perfect table   corner booths for the win we ordered the meat board for two as a starter  carbonara and lasagna for the mains  everything was tasty  looked great on the plate and considering how busy the restaurant was  the service was fast too  it wasn t the best carbonara i ve ever had  but the lasagna was amazing i wish i could say that i got dessert as well  but i thought the menu was a bit boring so gave it a miss 
2345	4.0	I would come back here----if I tried every other place in London first.The food was good and very very fresh.There are lots of veggie options for non meat eaters.Service was lacking considering it's a little on the higher end....The food was delish. I found that a starter portion of risotto and a side salad was more than enough for me.My husband had the seafood bucatini and loved it!Nice location if you're going to a show or shopping nearby.I stopped in for lunch without a reservation and there wasn't an issue.	i would come back here    if i tried every other place in london first the food was good and very very fresh there are lots of veggie options for non meat eaters service was lacking considering it s a little on the higher end    the food was delish  i found that a starter portion of risotto and a side salad was more than enough for me my husband had the seafood bucatini and loved it nice location if you re going to a show or shopping nearby i stopped in for lunch without a reservation and there wasn t an issue 
2346	3.0	This place is fairly decent, but the experience depends on the weather and passersby. I don't remember the food being spectacularly exciting, but it's not bad, though on the slightly expensive side.Also their menus are really big, as in physically and comically large.Anyway, I'd recommend this as a nice place for a meet up our first casual date. A second date would be someplace quieter and with a ceiling.	this place is fairly decent  but the experience depends on the weather and passersby  i don t remember the food being spectacularly exciting  but it s not bad  though on the slightly expensive side also their menus are really big  as in physically and comically large anyway  i d recommend this as a nice place for a meet up our first casual date  a second date would be someplace quieter and with a ceiling 
2347	5.0	My whole family went out to eat here one night while were in London and we were very impressed. The only strange thing was that they made us choose between two menus a week in advance for a party of 7. Usually we can at least just order off either back in the states so we found that a bit strange, but nothing too terrible.I had the rump steak and it was DELICIOUS. I mean, when you think rump steak you're not thinking something as delicious and tender as I had. One of the best steaks I've had in a while not to mention it had pesto sauce so obviously that was an amazing combo. Also, the truffle pasta that came before it was so so so good. I hate truffle but the pasta and the sauce were so good I didn't even care.Our server was so sweet too, I wish I could remember her name to give her a nice shoutout. Whoever the sweet lil' blonde gal was, we thank you for a great meal. :-)	my whole family went out to eat here one night while were in london and we were very impressed  the only strange thing was that they made us choose between two menus a week in advance for a party of 7  usually we can at least just order off either back in the states so we found that a bit strange  but nothing too terrible i had the rump steak and it was delicious  i mean  when you think rump steak you re not thinking something as delicious and tender as i had  one of the best steaks i ve had in a while not to mention it had pesto sauce so obviously that was an amazing combo  also  the truffle pasta that came before it was so so so good  i hate truffle but the pasta and the sauce were so good i didn t even care our server was so sweet too  i wish i could remember her name to give her a nice shoutout  whoever the sweet lil  blonde gal was  we thank you for a great meal     
2348	4.0	I work pretty close to this Jamie's and decided to meet some friends there for dinner after work one day. Being gluten free and going to an Italian restaurant isn't always a great idea but to my surprise they had gluten free pasta and were able to easily accommodate my needs. The service was good, though a little slow and the tables are pretty packed in together. However, the food was delicious. The menu is decent with something that will suit all tastebuds.	i work pretty close to this jamie s and decided to meet some friends there for dinner after work one day  being gluten free and going to an italian restaurant isn t always a great idea but to my surprise they had gluten free pasta and were able to easily accommodate my needs  the service was good  though a little slow and the tables are pretty packed in together  however  the food was delicious  the menu is decent with something that will suit all tastebuds 
2349	3.0	This was the second Jamie's Italian I've visited, and thankfully I was much more impressed this time around. Mind you, one of the members of my party had the gold card, or whatever it's called, so they were particularly attentive. Nonetheless, this was a much cooler Jamie's and I especially liked sitting downstairs in the booths, where it reminds you of a true wine cellar. The food was delicious, and we had quite a range, from steak to squid ink pasta to chicken cutlet and a few traditional pasta dishes. We also had bellinis and wine and generally enjoyed ourselves. Our server was very friendly and attentive, as well.I'd recommend this far more than the Jamie's near the City, only because the atmosphere feels much more authentically Italian here. Other than that, it's your normal Jamie's, and you can have a great time if you're up for the experience.	this was the second jamie s italian i ve visited  and thankfully i was much more impressed this time around  mind you  one of the members of my party had the gold card  or whatever it s called  so they were particularly attentive  nonetheless  this was a much cooler jamie s and i especially liked sitting downstairs in the booths  where it reminds you of a true wine cellar  the food was delicious  and we had quite a range  from steak to squid ink pasta to chicken cutlet and a few traditional pasta dishes  we also had bellinis and wine and generally enjoyed ourselves  our server was very friendly and attentive  as well i d recommend this far more than the jamie s near the city  only because the atmosphere feels much more authentically italian here  other than that  it s your normal jamie s  and you can have a great time if you re up for the experience 
2350	5.0	Now that's what I'm talking about!  Bring it Chef.Fifteen was a let down on our last visit and I wanted to give one of Jamie Oliver's places another try.  We ended walking in at his Italian restaurant and I knew that I'd love it right from the start.  As we queued to be seated I watched the guy up front making all shapes and sizes of fresh pasta.  I wonder what he's doing there?  Maybe it's something I haven't seen before.  The dining room was pretty crowded even at the early hour, straight from the pub, and we were put in the back tightly between a few other tables.  We were starving, so we got right to it forgoing the tempting cheese and salami openers for several pastas.  They do primi and main portions, which is convenient and allowed us to indulge in different options.  I enjoyed the bread basket and olive oil while we waited on our dishes.  They all arrived at once and took up nearly the entire table.  To the daily special Lamb Ragu Papparadelle we added:BEAUTIFUL BUCATINI CARBONARATubular spaghetti with crispy fried smoked pancetta and ribbons of leek, tossed with eggs, thyme and Parmesan cheesePRAWN LINGUINEPan fried garlicky prawns with tomatoes, chilli, rocket and fennelTURBO FUSILLI ARRABIATASweet and spiced tomato sauce with herby breadcrumbs, sprinkled with my favourite Scotch bonnet chilliesMolto Bene!  Everything was delicious.  We really enjoyed being able to munch on all of these dishes as they each had different flavors and heat.  Speaking of which, those Scotch Bonnets in the Arrabiata brought the noise.  That was the dish we fought most over.  But, like any good husband, I let Kris finish it.  I love lamb and found the Ragu to be great.  The Carbonara was a bit rich for Kris.  I had no problem eating the lion's share of that one.  The prawns were also packed with flavor, unlike a similar effort I recently had at this dish that lacked anything going on.  We continued trading the dishes around the table until everything was gone and we were good and stuffed.  Four dishes were perfect for two.  We got a trio of fresh sorbettos, which I can't recall.  However, I remember them being very good and refreshing.  Service was spot on and we were never in need of anything.  The nice bottle of Italian Red went nicely with our meal.  We were a bit tightly packed in and the great meal nearly distracted me from the Swedish Bikini team groping each other at the table next to us.  Topless.  T O P L E S S.  Have you met my wife?These are the kind of Italian restaurants I love and it reminded me of SuperMario's joints in NYC.  Seeing the chefs work in the kitchen downstairs on my way to the Lou was cool too.  You'll want to get here early for the well priced and flawlessly executed meal.  Or just drop a name and wait it out at the nearby pubs.  Mangia!	now that s what i m talking about   bring it chef fifteen was a let down on our last visit and i wanted to give one of jamie oliver s places another try   we ended walking in at his italian restaurant and i knew that i d love it right from the start   as we queued to be seated i watched the guy up front making all shapes and sizes of fresh pasta   i wonder what he s doing there   maybe it s something i haven t seen before   the dining room was pretty crowded even at the early hour  straight from the pub  and we were put in the back tightly between a few other tables   we were starving  so we got right to it forgoing the tempting cheese and salami openers for several pastas   they do primi and main portions  which is convenient and allowed us to indulge in different options   i enjoyed the bread basket and olive oil while we waited on our dishes   they all arrived at once and took up nearly the entire table   to the daily special lamb ragu papparadelle we added beautiful bucatini carbonaratubular spaghetti with crispy fried smoked pancetta and ribbons of leek  tossed with eggs  thyme and parmesan cheeseprawn linguinepan fried garlicky prawns with tomatoes  chilli  rocket and fennelturbo fusilli arrabiatasweet and spiced tomato sauce with herby breadcrumbs  sprinkled with my favourite scotch bonnet chilliesmolto bene   everything was delicious   we really enjoyed being able to munch on all of these dishes as they each had different flavors and heat   speaking of which  those scotch bonnets in the arrabiata brought the noise   that was the dish we fought most over   but  like any good husband  i let kris finish it   i love lamb and found the ragu to be great   the carbonara was a bit rich for kris   i had no problem eating the lion s share of that one   the prawns were also packed with flavor  unlike a similar effort i recently had at this dish that lacked anything going on   we continued trading the dishes around the table until everything was gone and we were good and stuffed   four dishes were perfect for two   we got a trio of fresh sorbettos  which i can t recall   however  i remember them being very good and refreshing   service was spot on and we were never in need of anything   the nice bottle of italian red went nicely with our meal   we were a bit tightly packed in and the great meal nearly distracted me from the swedish bikini team groping each other at the table next to us   topless   t o p l e s s   have you met my wife these are the kind of italian restaurants i love and it reminded me of supermario s joints in nyc   seeing the chefs work in the kitchen downstairs on my way to the lou was cool too   you ll want to get here early for the well priced and flawlessly executed meal   or just drop a name and wait it out at the nearby pubs   mangia 
2351	4.0	We started with Worlds best Olives on Ice - oh my , delicious.  Not your average olives and it came with a black olive tapenade that was so flavorful.  Also tried the crisp Squid - fresh and hot with a few slices of red chilis. Portions were perfect size without being too large and I thought the price was reasonable.My colleague had a special of the Lamb Salad and he enjoyed!  I ordered the Seafood Bucatini that is cooked in a bag, followed by some more wine and coffee.This was my first visit there and I really enjoyed the food and the service with the unique Olive starter.  Will definitely return.	we started with worlds best olives on ice   oh my   delicious   not your average olives and it came with a black olive tapenade that was so flavorful   also tried the crisp squid   fresh and hot with a few slices of red chilis  portions were perfect size without being too large and i thought the price was reasonable my colleague had a special of the lamb salad and he enjoyed   i ordered the seafood bucatini that is cooked in a bag  followed by some more wine and coffee this was my first visit there and i really enjoyed the food and the service with the unique olive starter   will definitely return 
2352	3.0	This branch of Jamie's is perfectly located to offer refuge to tired shoppers and give tourists a sample of their favourite TV chef. Even though there are quite a few branches of Jamies' Italians around London now, the place doesn't feel like a chain (until you have been to too many of those and the crapper joke starts feeling a bit tired).The menu offers a good selection of veggie and meat dishes and the portions are just right. We all had pasta today with two of us opting for the specials of aubergine ravioli with the others sticking to standard favourites of arrabiata and bolognese. The polenta chips are a great nibble for sharing.As with all things Italian Jamie's comes into its own in Summer while the metal seats and large glass windows give you a chill on a wet and windy winter's day.	this branch of jamie s is perfectly located to offer refuge to tired shoppers and give tourists a sample of their favourite tv chef  even though there are quite a few branches of jamies  italians around london now  the place doesn t feel like a chain  until you have been to too many of those and the crapper joke starts feeling a bit tired  the menu offers a good selection of veggie and meat dishes and the portions are just right  we all had pasta today with two of us opting for the specials of aubergine ravioli with the others sticking to standard favourites of arrabiata and bolognese  the polenta chips are a great nibble for sharing as with all things italian jamie s comes into its own in summer while the metal seats and large glass windows give you a chill on a wet and windy winter s day 
2353	4.0	We LOVED Jamie's Italian in Covent Garden. We walked in on a Friday and was seated right away with no reservation. The staff was courteous. You are crammed in so you will be sitting close to people, but the food is outstanding. We really enjoyed the italian nachos and the bolognese. They make their own pasta and it shows. It is excellent. Please note however that if you are used to getting grilled chicken breast on your caesar salad, then know that here and in most of london its, a grilled skin-on thigh on your salad. Other than that, the food was great, they have a nice wine list and the service is great.	we loved jamie s italian in covent garden  we walked in on a friday and was seated right away with no reservation  the staff was courteous  you are crammed in so you will be sitting close to people  but the food is outstanding  we really enjoyed the italian nachos and the bolognese  they make their own pasta and it shows  it is excellent  please note however that if you are used to getting grilled chicken breast on your caesar salad  then know that here and in most of london its  a grilled skin on thigh on your salad  other than that  the food was great  they have a nice wine list and the service is great 
2354	3.0	We had the crab cake balls for an appetizer. There were only three of them that is not enough for the price. I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese. It was a good portion size and tasted OK, but it was nothing special. We had the Molten Chocolate Praline Pudding for desert. It was good, but I liked the salted caramel ice cream better than the cake part.	we had the crab cake balls for an appetizer  there were only three of them that is not enough for the price  i had the tagliatelle bolognese  it was a good portion size and tasted ok  but it was nothing special  we had the molten chocolate praline pudding for desert  it was good  but i liked the salted caramel ice cream better than the cake part

2356	2.0	My brother had never been to a Jamie's and wanted to have the celeb chef experience. Also we went to see The Mousetrap after and the restaurant is perfectly located for that. Unfortunately the experience wasn't what we had hoped for. First of all, we were seated downstairs where it's kinda dark and boring - no feel of the Jamie charm. The waiters were only as friendly as they had to be and also walked past many times without noticing us. When I asked if a smaller portion of the pasta would be enough for my small appetite, he absolutely exaggerated the tininess of the plate which resulted in me ordering the bigger plate and then leaving half the dish uneaten. Obviously he did this to make me spend more but I just found it very dislikeable. Both our pasta dishes were good but nothing special. I LOVE Jamie Oliver but I'll probably not return to this branch in Covent Garden.	my brother had never been to a jamie s and wanted to have the celeb chef experience  also we went to see the mousetrap after and the restaurant is perfectly located for that  unfortunately the experience wasn t what we had hoped for  first of all  we were seated downstairs where it s kinda dark and boring   no feel of the jamie charm  the waiters were only as friendly as they had to be and also walked past many times without noticing us  when i asked if a smaller portion of the pasta would be enough for my small appetite  he absolutely exaggerated the tininess of the plate which resulted in me ordering the bigger plate and then leaving half the dish uneaten  obviously he did this to make me spend more but i just found it very dislikeable  both our pasta dishes were good but nothing special  i love jamie oliver but i ll probably not return to this branch in covent garden

It tasted ok, but it's just a ridiculous price for the size! My girlfriend had the chicken and it was tempered...order a pasta here, that's hard to get wrong.

2358	4.0	"This place was delicious! But being a fat American, I have to say I wish I got more lamb!For the table we had a baby mozzarella and tomato salad, sweet mini chili peppers, mushroom panzerotti and the best of british lamb piedini.SO good. Salad was best ""caprese"" salad we've ever had. There were all different kinds of tomatoes, and slightly cooked so it was just the right softness/freshness. Sweet mini chili peppers were stuffed with tuna, capers and anchovies, and it was good, but for some reason I was expecting chunks of raw tuna, but was probably just canned tuna. Good anyways! You get five of these on your plate, which is quite good for being part of the ""nibble"" section.Mains - not a big mushroom person, so I won't comment about that. Lamb was amazing! I love animals parts =P The kidney shoulder leg heart and liver came out on a skewer. Delicious but so little =(My only disappointment was the biggest piece on the skewer was what looked like something wrapped in bacon - and it just turned out to be a big old piece of crouton. Sigh. I suppose that's how Jamie keeps it affordable.All of it washed down quite well with a Shiraz they had on the wine list. I also tried the Florence Fizz off their cocktail list (when we got there, we had a 45 minute wait on a Wednesday evening!) So yummy!

2360	5.0	We came here for a belated Christmas lunch by one of our agencies. As it was a late lunch, it wasn't too busy so we had a long table in the downstairs, which had a really nice cosy atmosphere to it. The staff were so attentive at taking our orders and filling up our wine glasses (much to my appreciation) which made the whole thing feel very relaxed yet sophisticated. I expected a pretty basic Italian menu,  but was so impressed with the menu choice and it took me forever to decide! I chose a chicken breast with a side of chips, the chicken was cooked to perfection and was so moist and delicious. We also ordered lots of starters between us which were delicious - the olives (although they were described as the best in the world which I'm not sure of!) and the pasta nachos which were insane! I recommend this place if you're in the Covent Garden area.	we came here for a belated christmas lunch by one of our agencies  as it was a late lunch  it wasn t too busy so we had a long table in the downstairs  which had a really nice cosy atmosphere to it  the staff were so attentive at taking our orders and filling up our wine glasses  much to my appreciation  which made the whole thing feel very relaxed yet sophisticated  i expected a pretty basic italian menu   but was so impressed with the menu choice and it took me forever to decide  i chose a chicken breast with a side of chips  the chicken was cooked to perfection and was so moist and delicious  we also ordered lots of starters between us which were delicious   the olives  although they were described as the best in the world which i m not sure of   and the pasta nachos which were insane  i recommend this place if you re in the covent garden area

2362	4.0	This was my first experience with a Jamie Oliver restaurant and I was impressed.  We walked in with no reservation and had to wait around 40 minutes.  Luckily there are many things to do around and we just walked around until our time was up.  The staff was nice enough to offer cured meats/olives/cheeses to those waiting for a table, and they were good.  When we finally were able to get a table we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert to share.  The appetizers we ordered were the posh fries which were french fries with parmesan cheese and truffle oil.  I did not taste or smell any truffle.  The fries were thick and were not crunchy.  The other appetizer we ordered was the mushroom fritti which was served with a mayo  based sauce.  This was a tasty dish, full of mushroom flavor and went well with the sauce provided.  As for the 2 entrees me and the wife LOVE pastas so we both ordered a pasta dish.  I ordered the tagliatelle pasta with truffle oil and parmesan cheese.  My wife ordered the pasta carbonara with pancetta and peas.  Both were excellent dishes and I absolutely loved my pasta dish, so much so I gave a good amount to my wife so she could enjoy it.  For dessert we ordered their icecream.  You get to pick 3 scoops and 2 toppings.  We  chose the Caramel salt ice cream with Vanilla w/ honey comb and strawberry icecream.  The toppings we chose were crushed honeycomb and raspberry.  Now this was the first time Ive had honeycomb because its not really big in the states and I can honestly say I am baffled on why the US doesnt have it! Its so good!  All in all i would recommend this restaurant to anyone, tourist or local.  It is definitely worth the wait especially since the service was spotty, and there may be a wait to actually secure a table.	this was my first experience with a jamie oliver restaurant and i was impressed   we walked in with no reservation and had to wait around 40 minutes   luckily there are many things to do around and we just walked around until our time was up   the staff was nice enough to offer cured meats olives cheeses to those waiting for a table  and they were good   when we finally were able to get a table we ordered 2 appetizers  2 entrees  and a dessert to share   the appetizers we ordered were the posh fries which were french fries with parmesan cheese and truffle oil   i did not taste or smell any truffle   the fries were thick and were not crunchy   the other appetizer we ordered was the mushroom fritti which was served with a mayo  based sauce   this was a tasty dish  full of mushroom flavor and went well with the sauce provided   as for the 2 entrees me and the wife love pastas so we both ordered a pasta dish   i ordered the tagliatelle pasta with truffle oil and parmesan cheese   my wife ordered the pasta carbonara with pancetta and peas   both were excellent dishes and i absolutely loved my pasta dish  so much so i gave a good amount to my wife so she could enjoy it   for dessert we ordered their icecream   you get to pick 3 scoops and 2 toppings   we  chose the caramel salt ice cream with vanilla w  honey comb and strawberry icecream   the toppings we chose were crushed honeycomb and raspberry   now this was the first time ive had honeycomb because its not really big in the states and i can honestly say i am baffled on why the us doesnt have it  its so good   all in all i would recommend this restaurant to anyone  tourist or local   it is definitely worth the wait especially since the service was spotty  and there may be a wait to actually secure a table

2364	4.0	We tried to go to this restaurant once before, but when we saw that there was a 2 hour wait we decided to go somewhere else. This morning, I woke up determined to go for lunch as I love Jamie Oliver, his passion for food and his personality. The restaurant was nice, the service was very good and the overall atmosphere was good. I ordered Prawn Linguini and my boyfriend ordered chicken. The chicken was disappointing. The meat was good and fresh but the sauce tasted not as good as expected. May I just say before continuing that my expectation was very high as I am a real foodie and really wanted to go to Jamie's. The pasta were good, the sauce was good and the prawns were very very fresh. And it wasn't one of those restaurant where you get 2 prawns, here, the plate was filled with them. Prawns with pasta, not pasta with prawns. Then, we decided to share the Ultimate Chocolate, Rasberry and Amarreto Brownie. It was incredible. The presentation was very nice, and it tasted just incredibly good. We can taste both the rasberry and the chocolate with a little bit of amarreto. it was perfectly baked and tasted perfect. I am a fan of this one!	we tried to go to this restaurant once before  but when we saw that there was a 2 hour wait we decided to go somewhere else  this morning  i woke up determined to go for lunch as i love jamie oliver  his passion for food and his personality  the restaurant was nice  the service was very good and the overall atmosphere was good  i ordered prawn linguini and my boyfriend ordered chicken  the chicken was disappointing  the meat was good and fresh but the sauce tasted not as good as expected  may i just say before continuing that my expectation was very high as i am a real foodie and really wanted to go to jamie s  the pasta were good  the sauce was good and the prawns were very very fresh  and it wasn t one of those restaurant where you get 2 prawns  here  the plate was filled with them  prawns with pasta  not pasta with prawns  then  we decided to share the ultimate chocolate  rasberry and amarreto brownie  it was incredible  the presentation was very nice  and it tasted just incredibly good  we can taste both the rasberry and the chocolate with a little bit of amarreto  it was perfectly baked and tasted perfect  i am a fan of this one

Perfect texture and it came with a great cinnamon-infused syrup and caramelized pears on top.

2366	4.0	Came here for dinner last Saturday night with my friend. We were told it would be about a 30-40 minute wait, given a beeper (they also took down my mobile number just in case) and kindly suggested we go have a drink somewhere (i.e. go away, come back when we beep you). I hate that they don't take reservations. We went down the street to grab a coffee and chat, and sure enough, in about 30 minutes our beeper went off signaling a table was ready for us! The upper level was completely packed and we were seated in the lower level, which was also packed. I actually liked it because you could peek into the kitchen. There are chalkboards with daily specials scrawled on them, and all of the walls are decorated with glass cabinets displaying wine bottles, pasta and olive oil tins. We ordered the Top Italian Bread Selection to share. It was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. I would have preferred if they have given us a plate to pour the oil and vinegar into instead of the little sauce dish. The waitress didn't pour nearly enough vinegar into the dish and for the first few mouthfuls we were eating oily bread. We ordered a bottle of Ponte Pietra 2009 Trebbiano-Garganega to accompany our pasta and fish dishes. It was light, fruity and pleasant.We shared a couple of pasta dishes as starters. The Wild Truffle Tagliatelle was absolutely amazing! I would order this again the next time I come back. It was cheesy, buttery, truffle-y and perfect. The Mushroom Panzerotti was also very delicious. The tomato sauce was sweet, a little tart and a tiny bit spicy, which adds a nice kick to the dish. For the main we had the Fish Baked in a Bag. The fish of the day was Cod, and it was perfectly cooked. It was moist, flaky and so flavourful. It is baked with mussels, clams, smashed fennel, chili, anchovy over a bed of Sicilian cracked wheat. This dish was quite spicy, but bearable.For dessert I had the tiramisu and my friend had the chocolate, raspberry and amaretto brownie. The tiramisu was good, better than some that I've had, but not overly amazing. It was a good balance of moist espresso-soaked cake layers and marscapone layers. It's delicately flavoured with orange zest and served with orange crème fraiche, which gave it an interesting twist. The brownie was to die for - absolutely incredible.Overall we were both very happy with the food an service. WC is located on the lower level. The ambience was fun, casual and they played an awesome mix of 80's & 90's music throughout the evening. I completely recommend this spot, and will definitely be back.	came here for dinner last saturday night with my friend  we were told it would be about a 30 40 minute wait  given a beeper  they also took down my mobile number just in case  and kindly suggested we go have a drink somewhere  i e  go away  come back when we beep you   i hate that they don t take reservations  we went down the street to grab a coffee and chat  and sure enough  in about 30 minutes our beeper went off signaling a table was ready for us  the upper level was completely packed and we were seated in the lower level  which was also packed  i actually liked it because you could peek into the kitchen  there are chalkboards with daily specials scrawled on them  and all of the walls are decorated with glass cabinets displaying wine bottles  pasta and olive oil tins  we ordered the top italian bread selection to share  it was served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping  i would have preferred if they have given us a plate to pour the oil and vinegar into instead of the little sauce dish  the waitress didn t pour nearly enough vinegar into the dish and for the first few mouthfuls we were eating oily bread  we ordered a bottle of ponte pietra 2009 trebbiano garganega to accompany our pasta and fish dishes  it was light  fruity and pleasant we shared a couple of pasta dishes as starters  the wild truffle tagliatelle was absolutely amazing  i would order this again the next time i come back  it was cheesy  buttery  truffle y and perfect  the mushroom panzerotti was also very delicious  the tomato sauce was sweet  a little tart and a tiny bit spicy  which adds a nice kick to the dish  for the main we had the fish baked in a bag  the fish of the day was cod  and it was perfectly cooked  it was moist  flaky and so flavourful  it is baked with mussels  clams  smashed fennel  chili  anchovy over a bed of sicilian cracked wheat  this dish was quite spicy  but bearable for dessert i had the tiramisu and my friend had the chocolate  raspberry and amaretto brownie  the tiramisu was good  better than some that i ve had  but not overly amazing  it was a good balance of moist espresso soaked cake layers and marscapone layers  it s delicately flavoured with orange zest and served with orange cr me fraiche  which gave it an interesting twist  the brownie was to die for   absolutely incredible overall we were both very happy with the food an service  wc is located on the lower level  the ambience was fun  casual and they played an awesome mix of 80 s   90 s music throughout the evening  i completely recommend this spot  and will definitely be back

The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  The services was excellent, I ordered the meatball reginette.  The meatballs were delicious.  This is Italian fusion, if you are looking for traditional Italian cuisine, it is not here.  They have a playful twist of traditional pasta.  With cool and innovating styles of pasta used.	i stopped in on a monday night  the restaurant has a great atmosphere   the services was excellent  i ordered the meatball reginette   the meatballs were delicious   this is italian fusion  if you are looking for traditional italian cuisine  it is not here   they have a playful twist of traditional pasta   with cool and innovating styles of pasta used 
2369	5.0	I love, love, love Jamie's Italian. What's great: 1) Pastas! They are amazing. My favorites are Jool's Tuna Fusilli, the Pappardelle and the Tagliatelle. If you can't decide, just order 2 starter size portions so you can sample a couple different dishes :D I've heard mixed reviews from folks who have tried to order other things from the menu. I've never tried anything other than the pastas for my main, but I've had friends who have and I've heard mixed reviews like, the chicken is awesome, but the risotto is bland. Stick with the pasta, you'll be happy!2) Antipasta Meat Platter!! A must have as a starter. They bring out a giant board portioned according to how many people are at your table. The board is filled will wonderful meats, cheese, olives, etc. Delicious. 3) Casual atmosphere. You don't need reservations unless you have a really large group. Just show up and they will get you a table as soon as possible. Note: It is pretty busy on Fri - Sun, so get there early or you'll be in a queue for an hour. When the weather is nice, I like getting a drink at the bar and waiting in the outside patio until a table is ready.4) Reasonable prices.	i love  love  love jamie s italian  what s great  1  pastas  they are amazing  my favorites are jool s tuna fusilli  the pappardelle and the tagliatelle  if you can t decide  just order 2 starter size portions so you can sample a couple different dishes  d i ve heard mixed reviews from folks who have tried to order other things from the menu  i ve never tried anything other than the pastas for my main  but i ve had friends who have and i ve heard mixed reviews like  the chicken is awesome  but the risotto is bland  stick with the pasta  you ll be happy 2  antipasta meat platter   a must have as a starter  they bring out a giant board portioned according to how many people are at your table  the board is filled will wonderful meats  cheese  olives  etc  delicious  3  casual atmosphere  you don t need reservations unless you have a really large group  just show up and they will get you a table as soon as possible  note  it is pretty busy on fri   sun  so get there early or you ll be in a queue for an hour  when the weather is nice  i like getting a drink at the bar and waiting in the outside patio until a table is ready 4  reasonable prices 
2370	4.0	I've come here many times as Jamie is so big in Europe and visitors from all over want to try one of his restaurants. I've come here for both lunch and dinner and been pleasantly surprised. I've had everything from pasta to salad to one if their hamburgers and always been happy with my order. There is also a little shop where you can buy some of his stuff - anything from cook books to kitchen ware. They don't take  reservations but I don't think I've ever waited longer than 30-40 minutes (for dinner). Get a drink at the bar while you wait!	i ve come here many times as jamie is so big in europe and visitors from all over want to try one of his restaurants  i ve come here for both lunch and dinner and been pleasantly surprised  i ve had everything from pasta to salad to one if their hamburgers and always been happy with my order  there is also a little shop where you can buy some of his stuff   anything from cook books to kitchen ware  they don t take  reservations but i don t think i ve ever waited longer than 30 40 minutes  for dinner   get a drink at the bar while you wait 
2371	3.0	"4-star food in an otherwise mediocre joint. (Sorry, Jamie!)I really like the way Jamie Oliver cooks: get good, fresh food, prepare it simply, let it shine. Not too fussy, not too proper. My kind of cooking. And despite it being an Italian restaurant in the tourist district of London, I was willing to give it a shot on name alone.As far as I can tell, everyone's mains were good. No michelin stars here, but fresh ingredients, prepared simply, shining on their merits. If only the mains were the whole of the thing.The appetizers tried too hard, or didn't try at all. We ordered a few rounds Bruschetta and got these longboards of bread topped in a variety of ways, but none really hit the mark. The bread was soggy, suggesting they'd been waiting for a while. The toppings were chilled like they'd come out of a fridge, even when that tightened up the flavour. The calamari was nothing to write home about. The olives were a stand out there, prepared simply and delicious.Drinks were similarly a mess. The disappointing two beers on offer weren't surprising in an italian joint, but the bar was not much better. A syrupy negroni for one friend and a pretty weak mojito for the other. Clearly we were being driven towards the wine list but that, too, was pretty one-note. Giant super-tuscans might be the thing that sells tourists, but it's hard for me to believe Jamie couldn't find a single medium bodied offering from Piemonte, say, if only for variety.Here's the lowdown: the downstairs dining area is nice, and a bit quieter. The mains are really rockin'. If you are careful to order the appetizers that hew to the mantra of ""fresh ingredients prepared simply"" like, say, the olives, you can do well there, too. If you call ahead to avoid the wait, you can have a 4-star night here. But there are places in London where the default is a 4- (or 5!) star night and they don't make you work so hard for it.Pro-tip: order the truffled fries. I don't care that they aren't italian. Find the chump at your table who's ordering a steak, and steal his truffled fries. I'll distract him.

We chose from the Christmas set menu and were not disappointed. We were seated promptly and served quickly. When we sat down our starters (antipasti) were already waiting for us and they were delicious. Made even better when they delivered to us a glass of prosecco each and some deep fried and parmesan covered gnocchi! For the main I had Genaro's porchetta which was a lovely big piece of rolled and stuffed pork belly with roast vegetables and polenta ""chips"" on the side. Dessert was a lemon meringue cheese cake cake was also great. I highly recommend this restaurant.

What works in this palce is the fact the bread is freshly baked on site, the meat is sliced to order and the cheese is of the hishest quality, the tomatos were varied and full of flavour and the dippings oils also very tasty.I would go back for sure.Jurgen	amid a busy day of touristy walking around the city we stopped here for a rest and some food was pleasantly surprised after all i have heard about jamies places around the city  much to the disgust of the waitress we were only after some grazing to replenish our energy knowing we would be eating 3 hrs later so after a scan we had the bread basket  wild boar salami  truffel salami and caprese salad  what works in this palce is the fact the bread is freshly baked on site  the meat is sliced to order and the cheese is of the hishest quality  the tomatos were varied and full of flavour and the dippings oils also very tasty i would go back for sure jurgen
2378	3.0	Jaime's Italian saved me from a torrential downpour on a particularly gloomy afternoon in London.  It was a dramatic experience to watch the thunder and lighting from within the funky and fun restaurant.  Giant meat counter in green marble, wood and metal furniture throughout, industrial lighting, this is Jaime Oliver to the core.We sampled the 2009 unoaked organic chardonnay from Puglia.  A house wine, unfiltered, delivered to the premises in tetra pack cartons, and served in decanters.  Organic, check.  Natural, check.  Green, check.  Trendy to the core.  For starters, we had the Bocconcini Pomodoro.  Little mozzarella balls, very soft and intensely creamy, almost like burrata.  The cherry tomatoes were also intensely tomatoey.  A little dish that packed a lot of punch.  The Brixham Scallop and Squid Ink Angel Hair tasted like the ocean in a pasta bowl.  The South Coast Fritto Misto could have been an installation at the Saatchi.  Brown butcher paper covered the large platter.  A giant prawn, head and tail and all, wrapped in fresh angel hair and then deep fried.  Behind it were morsels of other delectable fish and seafood.  A squeeze of lemon and a little cup of aioli, this beat any fish and chips any day.Why 3 stars?  Jaime's Italian is a fun place for lunch or a casual dinner.  It continues Mr Oliver's concept of simple and delicious (and modernized) Italian food.	jaime s italian saved me from a torrential downpour on a particularly gloomy afternoon in london   it was a dramatic experience to watch the thunder and lighting from within the funky and fun restaurant   giant meat counter in green marble  wood and metal furniture throughout  industrial lighting  this is jaime oliver to the core we sampled the 2009 unoaked organic chardonnay from puglia   a house wine  unfiltered  delivered to the premises in tetra pack cartons  and served in decanters   organic  check   natural  check   green  check   trendy to the core   for starters  we had the bocconcini pomodoro   little mozzarella balls  very soft and intensely creamy  almost like burrata   the cherry tomatoes were also intensely tomatoey   a little dish that packed a lot of punch   the brixham scallop and squid ink angel hair tasted like the ocean in a pasta bowl   the south coast fritto misto could have been an installation at the saatchi   brown butcher paper covered the large platter   a giant prawn  head and tail and all  wrapped in fresh angel hair and then deep fried   behind it were morsels of other delectable fish and seafood   a squeeze of lemon and a little cup of aioli  this beat any fish and chips any day why 3 stars   jaime s italian is a fun place for lunch or a casual dinner   it continues mr oliver s concept of simple and delicious  and modernized  italian food

When wandering around Covent Garden and I saw the restaurant I KNEW I was going to eat there. Coming from the US I had no idea if locals thought of this place as a tourist trap or if it was to be taken seriously--but I didn't care. We put our name in and had an Italian beer while we waited 25 mins for our table. We had polenta chips and an Italian assortment ""board"" to start and both were pretty good. I had mushroom and cheese ravioli for the main course and it was perfect. For dessert I had the ultimate brownie and my girlfriend had the pannacotta. The brownie was really good--the pannacotta was good but nothing memorable. Where they took a hit for me was the risotto my girlfriend ordered. It was crunchy! Knowing that the man has an entire chapter of TWO of his books dedicated to instructing others on risotto making--and even videos on the iPad app--I found this to be an unforgivable flaw. Everything else was good though. The service was nice. Our waiter--a little spaced out--was still nice. The setup was cute.

2383	3.0	"I decided to spend my last weekend in the UK in London... for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee!  What a way to close three wonderful years in the UK.  On one of the nights, my fellow American expat suggested we head to Jamie's.  Splendid idea!  When we got there, the wait was about 40 minutes... normally we would probably look for another place, but it finally stopped raining, so we decided we would wait and sit in the courtyard while we waited (the little lobby/waiting area was too crowded to hang about...).  Fortunately the little pager worked that far away!Inside we were seated, but trying to get up to go to the toilet... well that was difficult because the tables on either side were so close.  In fact we were watching one table try to leave, but the guy almost took dinner off the table next to them!  I know tables can be close, but the problem is that all of them were so close that it was difficult for anyone to move a table.  For starters, Ang enjoys the Polenta Chips and I like the Funky Chips, but really wanted to try the Posh Chips.  I knew I was probably ordering pasta, so I figured an order of Posh Chips would be a cheeky... posh starter.  And since they aren't a huge portion, it would just be a taster ;)The nice thing about what we chose for starters was that they came out really quick because we were starvin' like Marvin!  However, after we had placed our orders for our mains, Ang and I noticed more than just one special...  In fact, if you looked at the boards throughout the restaurant, there was a different dish on each one!  While I was tempted to change my order, I stayed with it, but Ang asked the waitress if she could change hers.  It was nice that the waitress was able to make the change, but it would have been nicer had the waitress told us the specials or asked if we wanted to hear the specials... as most places do.The other thing about the tables being so close... you are practically a part of the next table's convo.  In this case it was a group of drunk Irish girls... potentially on a Hen Night, but a little unclear.  Things were jovial at first and then there was a phone call and... well I've never here ""feckin'"" used so much in my life... well besides watching ""Mrs. Brown's Boys"".  Ang and I were eyeing their desserts and cocktails... and they were eyeing my Posh Chips!  I tried the Polenta Chips... I'm not a fan of Polenta and while I liked the crispy bits on the outside, I didn't like the mushy, cakey bit on the inside and since they are huge blocks (not really chips), there is more mushy than crispy.  The Posh Chips were lovely, I can't say I tasted much truffle and I would have loved more cheese... it would have spared me from salting the chips.I cannot remember what Ang had for the life of me... I think it may have been a seafood dish, but she seemed to enjoy it.  I had Jools' Favourite Sicilian Tuna Fusilli.  It was good, but the whole meal wasn't quite as good as my first with the Rabbit Ragu and the salad.  The tuna kind of looked like it came out of a can, rather than fresh because it was all tiny, squidgy bits, rather than nice big flaky pieces.  I did enjoy the use of cinnamon though... after a visit to Morocco, I am loving the use of cinnamon in savoury dishes.  Because of the way the fish was, I would have preferred a more delicate pasta than the Fusilli, but it was still a satisfying dish.  We were considering dessert, especially after seeing the lovely desserts that were devoured by the girls next to us, but we were really full and knew that dessert was going to make the journey back to her house in West Ham very uncomfortable.I know Jamie is trying to change food at American schools, but while he's doing that, could he open a few restaurants here in the states... for those of us that already appreciate good quality food?!  Pretty please!"	i decided to spend my last weekend in the uk in london    for the queen s diamond jubilee   what a way to close three wonderful years in the uk   on one of the nights  my fellow american expat suggested we head to jamie s   splendid idea   when we got there  the wait was about 40 minutes    normally we would probably look for another place  but it finally stopped raining  so we decided we would wait and sit in the courtyard while we waited  the little lobby waiting area was too crowded to hang about       fortunately the little pager worked that far away inside we were seated  but trying to get up to go to the toilet    well that was difficult because the tables on either side were so close   in fact we were watching one table try to leave  but the guy almost took dinner off the table next to them   i know tables can be close  but the problem is that all of them were so close that it was difficult for anyone to move a table   for starters  ang enjoys the polenta chips and i like the funky chips  but really wanted to try the posh chips   i knew i was probably ordering pasta  so i figured an order of posh chips would be a cheeky    posh starter   and since they aren t a huge portion  it would just be a taster   the nice thing about what we chose for starters was that they came out really quick because we were starvin  like marvin   however  after we had placed our orders for our mains  ang and i noticed more than just one special     in fact  if you looked at the boards throughout the restaurant  there was a different dish on each one   while i was tempted to change my order  i stayed with it  but ang asked the waitress if she could change hers   it was nice that the waitress was able to make the change  but it would have been nicer had the waitress told us the specials or asked if we wanted to hear the specials    as most places do the other thing about the tables being so close    you are practically a part of the next table s convo   in this case it was a group of drunk irish girls    potentially on a hen night  but a little unclear   things were jovial at first and then there was a phone call and    well i ve never here  feckin   used so much in my life    well besides watching  mrs  brown s boys    ang and i were eyeing their desserts and cocktails    and they were eyeing my posh chips   i tried the polenta chips    i m not a fan of polenta and while i liked the crispy bits on the outside  i didn t like the mushy  cakey bit on the inside and since they are huge blocks  not really chips   there is more mushy than crispy   the posh chips were lovely  i can t say i tasted much truffle and i would have loved more cheese    it would have spared me from salting the chips i cannot remember what ang had for the life of me    i think it may have been a seafood dish  but she seemed to enjoy it   i had jools  favourite sicilian tuna fusilli   it was good  but the whole meal wasn t quite as good as my first with the rabbit ragu and the salad   the tuna kind of looked like it came out of a can  rather than fresh because it was all tiny  squidgy bits  rather than nice big flaky pieces   i did enjoy the use of cinnamon though    after a visit to morocco  i am loving the use of cinnamon in savoury dishes   because of the way the fish was  i would have preferred a more delicate pasta than the fusilli  but it was still a satisfying dish   we were considering dessert  especially after seeing the lovely desserts that were devoured by the girls next to us  but we were really full and knew that dessert was going to make the journey back to her house in west ham very uncomfortable i know jamie is trying to change food at american schools  but while he s doing that  could he open a few restaurants here in the states    for those of us that already appreciate good quality food    pretty please 
2384	1.0	Not good...I went with a group of ladies and ordered the steak.  It was flavorless and there were gummy, veiny parts.  It - honest to God - looked like the cheapest cut of steak available.  For £14.25?!  Oh hell no.  I also ordered the truffle and parmesan fries and those were good, but if you fuck up fries, you shouldn't be in the restaurant business.  I will not be coming back nor recommending...Most likely designed as a tourist trap.	not good   i went with a group of ladies and ordered the steak   it was flavorless and there were gummy  veiny parts   it   honest to god   looked like the cheapest cut of steak available   for  14 25    oh hell no   i also ordered the truffle and parmesan fries and those were good  but if you fuck up fries  you shouldn t be in the restaurant business   i will not be coming back nor recommending   most likely designed as a tourist trap 
2385	1.0	Came here last night. Quite excited as I like Jamie Oliver's recipes and the menu looked fantastic. What a let down. Started with the 'World's Best Olives on Ice'. It was okay. Moved on to the pasta puttanesca which was bland. I also tasted my friend's squid ink risotto which was similarly tasteless. In a last ditch attempt to gain something from the experience, I went for the tiramisu. This was solid, as if it had been frozen, and was more like an 80's Black Forest Gateau from Iceland supermarket. A simply dreadful experience, not helped by the fact that the waiter was on another planet, loping off and forgetting drinks and salads, but still managing to charge us for them! . I'm sure that if it were not for the famous name of the proprietor (who probably has never set foot in the place), it would not be as busy. Never again.	came here last night  quite excited as i like jamie oliver s recipes and the menu looked fantastic  what a let down  started with the  world s best olives on ice   it was okay  moved on to the pasta puttanesca which was bland  i also tasted my friend s squid ink risotto which was similarly tasteless  in a last ditch attempt to gain something from the experience  i went for the tiramisu  this was solid  as if it had been frozen  and was more like an 80 s black forest gateau from iceland supermarket  a simply dreadful experience  not helped by the fact that the waiter was on another planet  loping off and forgetting drinks and salads  but still managing to charge us for them    i m sure that if it were not for the famous name of the proprietor  who probably has never set foot in the place   it would not be as busy  never again 
2386	3.0	My colleague took me here for lunch.  I couldn't believe I had the opportunity to eat at a Jamie Oliver restaurant. I have a good friend that LOVES Jamie Olivier, and only cooks items from his cook books.  Being in Switzerland you don't get the opportunity to have a good burger often. I saw that there was a burger on the menu, and I couldn't turn the opportunity down to try it.  It was beautiful to look at, but it took a couple of moments to figure out how one would eat it.  The presentation was fantastic, but the lettuce was so so thick, that you had to cut it, and smash the lettuce down, to be able to eat it without the food ending up everywhere but your stomach.  The flavor though was not compromised by the large lettuce display.  The bread was toasted to perfection. The burger was fantastic. I would definitely go back to try some of the other offerings.	my colleague took me here for lunch   i couldn t believe i had the opportunity to eat at a jamie oliver restaurant  i have a good friend that loves jamie olivier  and only cooks items from his cook books   being in switzerland you don t get the opportunity to have a good burger often  i saw that there was a burger on the menu  and i couldn t turn the opportunity down to try it   it was beautiful to look at  but it took a couple of moments to figure out how one would eat it   the presentation was fantastic  but the lettuce was so so thick  that you had to cut it  and smash the lettuce down  to be able to eat it without the food ending up everywhere but your stomach   the flavor though was not compromised by the large lettuce display   the bread was toasted to perfection  the burger was fantastic  i would definitely go back to try some of the other offerings 
2387	3.0	I would probably have enjoyed this restaurant more if we hadn't visited so close to Christmas  we were surrounded by the inevitable office parties where people were a little too drunk and loud. Reserved a table on the same night and only had to wait an hour for one to become available. Decided to have the burgers, which were well cooked and nicely presented. We tried out all the different types of fries between us, as well as some rocket salad. Staff were friendly, service was prompt and bill was reasonable  about £25 per head for main course including side dishes, wine and coffee.Tables are a bit too close together  I kept expecting our glasses to be knocked onto the floor by the people next to us.The Victorian style tiled loos are a big mistake and not particularly clean, which was rather off-putting, but overall not bad as restaurants go.	i would probably have enjoyed this restaurant more if we hadn t visited so close to christmas  we were surrounded by the inevitable office parties where people were a little too drunk and loud  reserved a table on the same night and only had to wait an hour for one to become available  decided to have the burgers  which were well cooked and nicely presented  we tried out all the different types of fries between us  as well as some rocket salad  staff were friendly  service was prompt and bill was reasonable  about  25 per head for main course including side dishes  wine and coffee tables are a bit too close together  i kept expecting our glasses to be knocked onto the floor by the people next to us the victorian style tiled loos are a big mistake and not particularly clean  which was rather off putting  but overall not bad as restaurants go 
2388	1.0	We were sorely disappointed with our experience at Jamie's Italian in Covent Garden.On the plus side: despite being busy, we were seated within a few minutes, even though we didn't have a reservation.On the minus side:1) all the seafood options were not available, which meant that 2 of us had very limited options since we do not eat meat2) we ordered 2 portions of the ravioli, which was average3) we ordered 1 milanese risotto and 1 truffle risotto, and both were extremely bland4) a waiter sat at a table next to ours outside, while we were inside, and through the window we could watch him count his tipsFrankly we expected much more from a Jamie Oliver restaurant.  We could excuse many things, but the quality of the food was so disappointing.	we were sorely disappointed with our experience at jamie s italian in covent garden on the plus side  despite being busy  we were seated within a few minutes  even though we didn t have a reservation on the minus side 1  all the seafood options were not available  which meant that 2 of us had very limited options since we do not eat meat2  we ordered 2 portions of the ravioli  which was average3  we ordered 1 milanese risotto and 1 truffle risotto  and both were extremely bland4  a waiter sat at a table next to ours outside  while we were inside  and through the window we could watch him count his tipsfrankly we expected much more from a jamie oliver restaurant   we could excuse many things  but the quality of the food was so disappointing 
2389	5.0	If there's a queue you get a pager. So before you've eaten you can pretend you are an 80's drug dealer or just leave with the pager! How cool is that? I can't fault this restaurant. I have been to four locations and they are all a smash. I usually eat alone, some places treat you strange or ignore you when you do this. Not at Jamie's. The staff are fantastic and their food knowledge is second to none. I like to start with the plank of mixed meat, cheese and olives. I usually go for the bolognese as an entree. It's so good that when I don't order it I feel like I'm cheating on it. The breadcrumbs, meat quality and home-made pasta really make it stand out. If you need me, I'll be chowing it all down with some nice wine.	if there s a queue you get a pager  so before you ve eaten you can pretend you are an 80 s drug dealer or just leave with the pager  how cool is that  i can t fault this restaurant  i have been to four locations and they are all a smash  i usually eat alone  some places treat you strange or ignore you when you do this  not at jamie s  the staff are fantastic and their food knowledge is second to none  i like to start with the plank of mixed meat  cheese and olives  i usually go for the bolognese as an entree  it s so good that when i don t order it i feel like i m cheating on it  the breadcrumbs  meat quality and home made pasta really make it stand out  if you need me  i ll be chowing it all down with some nice wine 
2390	5.0	"Quite frankly, I felt a bit embarrassed coming here. The idea of a restaurant with Jamie's face and all his ""funky"" and ""pukka"" vocab plastered everywhere made me uncomfortable, as much as the idea that a lot of people are coming here just because of the name.But, we needed to eat, and we came across it at 17:45 on a Saturday night with a short queue. We got our buzzer, and went for a drink at a nearby pub: the pub was crap, but the bare-shirted fight with a bouncer we saw was very entertaining.After 30 minutes or so we were buzzed and came back in to sit down.I surprised myself by enjoying the food a lot - best Italian I've had for a while.Accompanied by a decent 20 quid bottle of Pinot Grigio, I had the arancini (rice balls) followed by the scallop and squid ink spaghetti. They were both delicious as was my companion's choices.OK, so they have a burger on the menu, it's a chain, and Jamie is annoying, but it would be completely pretentious of me to not recommend the food here.Our bill (including that wine remember) came to a ridiculously reasonable 65 quid."	quite frankly  i felt a bit embarrassed coming here  the idea of a restaurant with jamie s face and all his  funky  and  pukka  vocab plastered everywhere made me uncomfortable  as much as the idea that a lot of people are coming here just because of the name but  we needed to eat  and we came across it at 17 45 on a saturday night with a short queue  we got our buzzer  and went for a drink at a nearby pub  the pub was crap  but the bare shirted fight with a bouncer we saw was very entertaining after 30 minutes or so we were buzzed and came back in to sit down i surprised myself by enjoying the food a lot   best italian i ve had for a while accompanied by a decent 20 quid bottle of pinot grigio  i had the arancini  rice balls  followed by the scallop and squid ink spaghetti  they were both delicious as was my companion s choices ok  so they have a burger on the menu  it s a chain  and jamie is annoying  but it would be completely pretentious of me to not recommend the food here our bill  including that wine remember  came to a ridiculously reasonable 65 quid

2393	1.0	Absolutely the worst meal I had in London during my stay. We had to send back 4 items. Everything was under salted, overcooked, and lacked flavor. The tomato salad w/ mozz should not be served if the tomatoes aren't good! They were sour and mushy. We tried the crab bruchetta, which tasted very fishy and more like canned tuna. The sea bass was disgusting....zero flavor. Finally the flutter beef (?) was severely overcooked. The manager came out and apologized and said she saw the food and it should never have been sent out like that. I would say they do have excellent customer service. On a brighter note, the spicy prawn linguine was excellent. I'm appalled that Jamie Oliver would have his name associated with this horrendous food!!!	absolutely the worst meal i had in london during my stay  we had to send back 4 items  everything was under salted  overcooked  and lacked flavor  the tomato salad w  mozz should not be served if the tomatoes aren t good  they were sour and mushy  we tried the crab bruchetta  which tasted very fishy and more like canned tuna  the sea bass was disgusting    zero flavor  finally the flutter beef     was severely overcooked  the manager came out and apologized and said she saw the food and it should never have been sent out like that  i would say they do have excellent customer service  on a brighter note  the spicy prawn linguine was excellent  i m appalled that jamie oliver would have his name associated with this horrendous food   
2394	2.0	Whilst in London for the weekend, me and my girlfriend went to Jamie's to celebrate her birthday. We'd booked a table but got there pretty early (45 minutes) we tried to ask the woman on the front desk if we might be sat earlier or if the time couldn't be changed in which case we would have visited the nearby shops and come back. The woman barely looked at us and simply snapped that we should wait at the bar implying it may be earlier. We ended up waiting for the full 45 minutes and longer until I had to go over again and remind them I'd booked (as we'd seen people with no booking coming in and being sat whilst we were still waiting). The bar area is right near the front door, has no seating and is really cramped with no atmosphere. Once we were seated the waiting staff were much better, they were friendly and showed good knowledge of the menu. The food was its usual Jamie's standard (very good). My only criticism of the restaurant area is the seating was very cramped - you could hear everyone's conversations and you had to constantly pull your chair in to allow other customers to get in/out of their table. All in all our night got better than how it started but it was still a disappointing visit especially for a birthday meal.	whilst in london for the weekend  me and my girlfriend went to jamie s to celebrate her birthday  we d booked a table but got there pretty early  45 minutes  we tried to ask the woman on the front desk if we might be sat earlier or if the time couldn t be changed in which case we would have visited the nearby shops and come back  the woman barely looked at us and simply snapped that we should wait at the bar implying it may be earlier  we ended up waiting for the full 45 minutes and longer until i had to go over again and remind them i d booked  as we d seen people with no booking coming in and being sat whilst we were still waiting   the bar area is right near the front door  has no seating and is really cramped with no atmosphere  once we were seated the waiting staff were much better  they were friendly and showed good knowledge of the menu  the food was its usual jamie s standard  very good   my only criticism of the restaurant area is the seating was very cramped   you could hear everyone s conversations and you had to constantly pull your chair in to allow other customers to get in out of their table  all in all our night got better than how it started but it was still a disappointing visit especially for a birthday meal

2396	4.0	I went here for a birthday dinner the day after Valentine's day so I didn't think the wait would be that bad. Apparently that doesn't really matter in London! We still waited about 20 minutes but it was worth it.It was a bit of a boozy dinner (2 bottles of wine for 2 of us) but the pasta carbonara was delicious as was the steak. The crowd seemed on the younger side, and probably touristy, but I wasn't really paying attention. It was bustling but not loud so it allowed for easy conversation (no need to yell across the table). While I was never truly blown away by the fare in London (I still love the city but San Francisco has spoiled me!), Jamie's was without a doubt on the better end of the spectrum when it came to meals I ate there.	i went here for a birthday dinner the day after valentine s day so i didn t think the wait would be that bad  apparently that doesn t really matter in london  we still waited about 20 minutes but it was worth it it was a bit of a boozy dinner  2 bottles of wine for 2 of us  but the pasta carbonara was delicious as was the steak  the crowd seemed on the younger side  and probably touristy  but i wasn t really paying attention  it was bustling but not loud so it allowed for easy conversation  no need to yell across the table   while i was never truly blown away by the fare in london  i still love the city but san francisco has spoiled me    jamie s was without a doubt on the better end of the spectrum when it came to meals i ate there 
2397	5.0	"I'll openly admit this. I'm fast becoming a Jamie Oliver fan. Not that I wasn't before, but seriously even without the school dinners campaign, this man is changing my culinary life slowly, so much so, that any time an Italian restaurant is mentioned, my response is ""Just go to Jamie's Italian... seriously, it's aaaaaaaaamazing.""It started on a Sunday morning back at the parents, I happened to glance at the TV in the background that had Jamie Oliver cooking his Pan-Asian salmon recipe. Then the making of the recipe for a friend. It was aaaaaaaaaaamazing. Then the buying of a book. Then going to the restaurant chain and eating the most aaaaaaaamazing mozzarella ball with fresh green pesto. Or fresh green olives on ice with the most amazing sun-dried tomatoes and black olive tapenade. The list goes on.The staff are all uber-friendly nationwide (I've also been to one in Oxford) and the loos are very amusing. I like the decor, the tins of tomatoes, the atmosphere. Seriously, what is there not to love? When choosing a main, there's a choice between a small and large plate (just in case, you're too full from eating starters) and the desserts, especially the brownie with raspberries and vanilla ice cream... worth saving space for. I could go on but I fear I may sound a tad deranged and fan-crazy. I'll end on this note, there isn't anything on the menu that I wouldn't eat and it's just a great place to have a nice meal.

2398	3.0	Walked past this place every night this week and figured I had to eat here before heading out of town...Waited about 90 minutes for a table at 7PM on a Sat night....had some decent wine and read a book while I waited. Got a seat downstairs, which I didn't know existed. Good atmosphere. Had the meat antipasto, which was excellent -- best mozzarella I've ever had, meats were very fresh, it was great. Ordered the crab and squid ink risotto for dinner....good portion of risotto, kind of skimpy on the crab, but, when mixed with the panko, the flavors really worked. My only complaint -- the risotto was undercooked. I was a tad disappointed -- I wished I had gotten something else. The dishes around me looked excellent. Wrapped up dinner with a cappuccino and the chocolate espresso tartlet, which was good. The orange cream was refreshing.  I'd definitely go back, but I'd skip the risotto.	walked past this place every night this week and figured i had to eat here before heading out of town   waited about 90 minutes for a table at 7pm on a sat night    had some decent wine and read a book while i waited  got a seat downstairs  which i didn t know existed  good atmosphere  had the meat antipasto  which was excellent    best mozzarella i ve ever had  meats were very fresh  it was great  ordered the crab and squid ink risotto for dinner    good portion of risotto  kind of skimpy on the crab  but  when mixed with the panko  the flavors really worked  my only complaint    the risotto was undercooked  i was a tad disappointed    i wished i had gotten something else  the dishes around me looked excellent  wrapped up dinner with a cappuccino and the chocolate espresso tartlet  which was good  the orange cream was refreshing   i d definitely go back  but i d skip the risotto

2400	4.0	Really solid.  Jamie knows how to do restaurants.  Of course, based on his popularity the wait time is a bit ridiculous, but we settled for a bar table.  I particularly loved the squid appetizer and other things such as the olives and berrata were tasty.  I had the ravioli for which I wished I had ordered something more adventurous.  Everyone at my finicky table was happy and I eyed the hamburger with regret.  Lemon curd was a good but very heavy dessert.  Service could have been less aloof in my opinion,but all in all a decent experience.	really solid   jamie knows how to do restaurants   of course  based on his popularity the wait time is a bit ridiculous  but we settled for a bar table   i particularly loved the squid appetizer and other things such as the olives and berrata were tasty   i had the ravioli for which i wished i had ordered something more adventurous   everyone at my finicky table was happy and i eyed the hamburger with regret   lemon curd was a good but very heavy dessert   service could have been less aloof in my opinion but all in all a decent experience

And to be honest, I'm a little over it.BUTThis was a great meal, great service, great price!Jamie (not Oliver) was fantastic and attentive.  Only let down was the very ordinary cocktail we had to start. You may be sick or Mr Oliver, but really really go to this gaff! Very worth it.	well  the guy tries to save the world all the time  and to be honest  i m a little over it butthis was a great meal  great service  great price jamie  not oliver  was fantastic and attentive   only let down was the very ordinary cocktail we had to start  you may be sick or mr oliver  but really really go to this gaff  very worth it 
2402	3.0	"Really? We had lunch here recently and thought it akin to a new age Olive Garden. My pasta was rubbery and the ""meatballs"" could hardly be called such, they were tiny granules of meat. Fortunately, we didn't waste time waiting for dinner here, it would have been a bigger disappointment. The waitstaff, though eager and bright-eyed had only a passing knowledge of the menu, although they were eager to try to sell us a t-shirt or other souvenir. I can only believe that fans of this place are dazzled by the ""rep"" and haven't noticed the food. Wild horses couldn't drag me back in here."	really  we had lunch here recently and thought it akin to a new age olive garden  my pasta was rubbery and the  meatballs  could hardly be called such  they were tiny granules of meat  fortunately  we didn t waste time waiting for dinner here  it would have been a bigger disappointment  the waitstaff  though eager and bright eyed had only a passing knowledge of the menu  although they were eager to try to sell us a t shirt or other souvenir  i can only believe that fans of this place are dazzled by the  rep  and haven t noticed the food  wild horses couldn t drag me back in here

Owen was awesome and had the beat attitude. He recommended a chocolate dessert with salted caramel gelato and it was amazing! 4 stars for the food, 5 for the service. Thanks Owen!	just had dinner here tonight and we had a great time  we are in town visiting from the states and we stumbled upon this restaurant  the food was good and the service was excellent  owen was awesome and had the beat attitude  he recommended a chocolate dessert with salted caramel gelato and it was amazing  4 stars for the food  5 for the service  thanks owen 
2404	5.0	I've been meaning to do this review since mid November but my experience is still fresh in my mind and it makes my mouth water every time I think about it. When my boyfriend said he wanted us to have dinner here I did what we all do and check out the reviews. Lachlan M's review offered great advise, ta very much! We arrived 45 minutes before we wanted to eat and were given a pager and we got beeped after 20 minutes result! Both being piggies we decided to eat like the Italians do. I don't think I've ever been so engrossed in a menu. Our poor waiter came over a couple of times to see if we were ready but after we order a glass of bubbly he graciously left us to it. After much debate with each other and advice from our waiter we chose:For starters - crispy squid, mushroom fritti and smoky scamorza arancini (crispy rice balls with mozzarella). We shared 3 starters as I couldn't bear the thought of food envy! The squid could have done with a bit more of a kick but it was gorgeous anyway. The mushrooms and rice balls were amazing and both had great dipping sauces.Pasta - I had the pumpkin panzerotti but was concerned it would be too sweet with the ameretti so the waiter suggested the ameretti on the side PERFECTION! My boyfriend chose the wild truffle tagliatelle which he thoroughly enjoyed. We both opted for the smaller sized portion so we could squeeze in our secondi!Secondi - I was a major pig and ordered the lamb chops and posh chips on the side (Posh means covered in truffle oil and parmesan YUM!!!!!!!!) My boyfriend chose the risotto of the day which I think was porcini and gorgonzola. We going to share the posh chips but as soon as they arrived i decided there was no way I was going to share them so we ordered another on top!I know you're thinking how could anyone want anything more on top of that. Well I did! After such a rich meal I felt I needed something to clear my palette so I got a few scoops of fruit sorbet to round off the evening.The whole evening was brilliant and the service was exceptional. Even with the high demand for tables as you can't booked unless for large groups at no point did we feel rushed to free up the table. Our waiter was charming and very informative. And to top it all off the meal was amazing value!In the words of Jamie Oliver, lovely jubbly!	i ve been meaning to do this review since mid november but my experience is still fresh in my mind and it makes my mouth water every time i think about it  when my boyfriend said he wanted us to have dinner here i did what we all do and check out the reviews  lachlan m s review offered great advise  ta very much  we arrived 45 minutes before we wanted to eat and were given a pager and we got beeped after 20 minutes result  both being piggies we decided to eat like the italians do  i don t think i ve ever been so engrossed in a menu  our poor waiter came over a couple of times to see if we were ready but after we order a glass of bubbly he graciously left us to it  after much debate with each other and advice from our waiter we chose for starters   crispy squid  mushroom fritti and smoky scamorza arancini  crispy rice balls with mozzarella   we shared 3 starters as i couldn t bear the thought of food envy  the squid could have done with a bit more of a kick but it was gorgeous anyway  the mushrooms and rice balls were amazing and both had great dipping sauces pasta   i had the pumpkin panzerotti but was concerned it would be too sweet with the ameretti so the waiter suggested the ameretti on the side perfection  my boyfriend chose the wild truffle tagliatelle which he thoroughly enjoyed  we both opted for the smaller sized portion so we could squeeze in our secondi secondi   i was a major pig and ordered the lamb chops and posh chips on the side  posh means covered in truffle oil and parmesan yum          my boyfriend chose the risotto of the day which i think was porcini and gorgonzola  we going to share the posh chips but as soon as they arrived i decided there was no way i was going to share them so we ordered another on top i know you re thinking how could anyone want anything more on top of that  well i did  after such a rich meal i felt i needed something to clear my palette so i got a few scoops of fruit sorbet to round off the evening the whole evening was brilliant and the service was exceptional  even with the high demand for tables as you can t booked unless for large groups at no point did we feel rushed to free up the table  our waiter was charming and very informative  and to top it all off the meal was amazing value in the words of jamie oliver  lovely jubbly 
2405	5.0	As an American, this was a dream come true. I have cooked with Jamie's books, listened to his podcast, and have watched his shows. Everything experienced through those mediums came rising to life the moment I stepped up. Afraid I would arrive too late, or get mixed up in the tube, I decided to walk a couple miles through London (not the worst thing in the world), then wait an hour to be seated. The staff was bubbly, alert, very friendly, and offered to let me wait next to the serving bar with a glass of wine while a single table opened up. The bar team kept the jokes, smiles and banter going while I sipped a house red. You could tell this was a good place to work, where the pride rested in food and delivery, not pomp and circumstance.I ordered an olive pesto appetizer with sparkling water and a simple spaghetti. Every piece of this experience was enjoyable. I even walked away with a package of Jamie's kitchen towels. Yet, that's the great thing about Jamie's food - no matter where you go, it finds a way back to your kitchen.	as an american  this was a dream come true  i have cooked with jamie s books  listened to his podcast  and have watched his shows  everything experienced through those mediums came rising to life the moment i stepped up  afraid i would arrive too late  or get mixed up in the tube  i decided to walk a couple miles through london  not the worst thing in the world   then wait an hour to be seated  the staff was bubbly  alert  very friendly  and offered to let me wait next to the serving bar with a glass of wine while a single table opened up  the bar team kept the jokes  smiles and banter going while i sipped a house red  you could tell this was a good place to work  where the pride rested in food and delivery  not pomp and circumstance i ordered an olive pesto appetizer with sparkling water and a simple spaghetti  every piece of this experience was enjoyable  i even walked away with a package of jamie s kitchen towels  yet  that s the great thing about jamie s food   no matter where you go  it finds a way back to your kitchen

I don't know much about Jamie Oliver, but I was afraid this was going to be a case of ""TV chef opens up lots of restaurants for a very general diner's tastes.""  You know, feed -the-masses, perfect-for-tourists kind of thing.  Thank you, Jamie for proving me wrong!  Although I could certainly bring any Midwesterner here without intimidation, the food still felt special and carefully prepared.  I had the pumpkin panzerotti - yumminess!  My friend can't come here without ordering the bolognese, so it must be good. One of us did have the pasta with truffle oil that he admitted ordering just because of the truffle oil.  He seemed mildly disappointed - don't be lured in by the truffle oil siren!!All in all, great value.  If I happened to be in the area, I would definitely stop in...but oh, we had a 45-minute wait."	i ll be honest  i was expecting to be disappointed  i don t know much about jamie oliver  but i was afraid this was going to be a case of  tv chef opens up lots of restaurants for a very general diner s tastes    you know  feed  the masses  perfect for tourists kind of thing   thank you  jamie for proving me wrong   although i could certainly bring any midwesterner here without intimidation  the food still felt special and carefully prepared   i had the pumpkin panzerotti   yumminess   my friend can t come here without ordering the bolognese  so it must be good  one of us did have the pasta with truffle oil that he admitted ordering just because of the truffle oil   he seemed mildly disappointed   don t be lured in by the truffle oil siren  all in all  great value   if i happened to be in the area  i would definitely stop in   but oh  we had a 45 minute wait

2408	2.0	We turned up on a busy Friday night after realizing that the wait at dishoom next door was 1.5 hours. Having been to the Greenwich location previously and rather enjoyed ourselves there we thought this would be an okay substitute. But we were fooled. The service was horrendous. After being seated it took our waitress 40 minutes to even say hello and ask if we wanted any drinks. Wine took another 15 minutes to arrive. Some drinks were forgotten and never showed up at all, same with a few starters. We all had pasta dishes which were bland, and of course took an hour to arrive after being ordered. All in all we spent 2.5 hours with the unattentive waitress, the boring overpriced food and the way too dry wine. Not going back there again.	we turned up on a busy friday night after realizing that the wait at dishoom next door was 1 5 hours  having been to the greenwich location previously and rather enjoyed ourselves there we thought this would be an okay substitute  but we were fooled  the service was horrendous  after being seated it took our waitress 40 minutes to even say hello and ask if we wanted any drinks  wine took another 15 minutes to arrive  some drinks were forgotten and never showed up at all  same with a few starters  we all had pasta dishes which were bland  and of course took an hour to arrive after being ordered  all in all we spent 2 5 hours with the unattentive waitress  the boring overpriced food and the way too dry wine  not going back there again 
2409	2.0	I love Jamie Oliver. I love his shows but I couldn't say so for his restaurant.Firstly, we had to wait over 2 1/2 hrs on a Sunday evening for the 8 of us as it doesn't take any bookings. When we arrived at 5.30pm, we were told to come back again around 7pm as it's still quite empty. We went back at 6pm (just in case) and we were told to wait for 2 1/2 hrs. Not impressed at all. If it wasn't for a friend's birthday, I would not have returned.We were given a buzzer & must be at least 200meters to the restaurant or the buzzer wouldn't work. Why don't they chain that buzzer to my ankle as I felt I am in prison since we were restricted where to go during our 2 1/2 hrs wait. There isn't a bar in the restaurant where we can sit & drink while we wait so we had to be somewhere close by or stand in the street like a lemon.The front of house was also very rude. We weren't impressed with his attitude. He didn't smile. He wasn't helpful. When he told us to wait, it feels as if he couldn't care less if we returned and never suggested where to go. He just didn't care. He shouldn't be at the front of house!The waitress who was serving us was very friendly & welcoming. However, she has mislead us to think that the £49 T-bone steak to be shared between 2 people would be a huge steak. The menu never stated how much the steak weighs but since the waitress emphised how huge it was, it came to a disappointment that this steak feeds 1 man or 2 ladies with small appitite. The wild boar salami was thinner than a Sainsbury Basics Waffer Ham which almost shattered into pieces when you touch it. The scallops with squid ink linguine was very salty, garlicy and dry... and the scallps were chopped into tiny pieces. If I pieced them together, it probably came up to 3 whole scallops. I could barely taste the squid ink in the linguine whereas I could when I had this dish in another Italian restaurant. We weren't impressed with the food nor the waiting hours. I will give it a one star but since the waitress tried really hard to entertain us, I've given it a 2 star. Go there for the ambience, but not the food. There are far more fantastic Italian restaurants which is run by real Italian families.	i love jamie oliver  i love his shows but i couldn t say so for his restaurant firstly  we had to wait over 2 1 2 hrs on a sunday evening for the 8 of us as it doesn t take any bookings  when we arrived at 5 30pm  we were told to come back again around 7pm as it s still quite empty  we went back at 6pm  just in case  and we were told to wait for 2 1 2 hrs  not impressed at all  if it wasn t for a friend s birthday  i would not have returned we were given a buzzer   must be at least 200meters to the restaurant or the buzzer wouldn t work  why don t they chain that buzzer to my ankle as i felt i am in prison since we were restricted where to go during our 2 1 2 hrs wait  there isn t a bar in the restaurant where we can sit   drink while we wait so we had to be somewhere close by or stand in the street like a lemon the front of house was also very rude  we weren t impressed with his attitude  he didn t smile  he wasn t helpful  when he told us to wait  it feels as if he couldn t care less if we returned and never suggested where to go  he just didn t care  he shouldn t be at the front of house the waitress who was serving us was very friendly   welcoming  however  she has mislead us to think that the  49 t bone steak to be shared between 2 people would be a huge steak  the menu never stated how much the steak weighs but since the waitress emphised how huge it was  it came to a disappointment that this steak feeds 1 man or 2 ladies with small appitite  the wild boar salami was thinner than a sainsbury basics waffer ham which almost shattered into pieces when you touch it  the scallops with squid ink linguine was very salty  garlicy and dry    and the scallps were chopped into tiny pieces  if i pieced them together  it probably came up to 3 whole scallops  i could barely taste the squid ink in the linguine whereas i could when i had this dish in another italian restaurant  we weren t impressed with the food nor the waiting hours  i will give it a one star but since the waitress tried really hard to entertain us  i ve given it a 2 star  go there for the ambience  but not the food  there are far more fantastic italian restaurants which is run by real italian families 
2410	4.0	"Went here with a workmate on a Wednesday night. The key to this place is planning. The place is popular and they don't take reservations for groups less than 6, so plan to get there at least 45mins before you want to be seated. They will give you a buzzer/pager and you can go have drinks somewhere nearby.Once you get past the tricky part of getting a table, you should be set for an evening of good service, good food and reasonable prices.To start we had a glass of Prosecco each and some truffled salami, fried squid with garlicky mayo and baked mushrooms.The mushrooms were simply amazing and the truffled salami was pretty tasty too. The squid was good without being exceptional.I was tossing up between two different bottles of wine to go with for our meal and was pleasantly surprised when the waiter simply offered to bring me a taste of both to see which I preferred. Excellent!For my main I had a small of the truffle tagliatelle (I know, I know, truffle salami, truffle pasta -- I'm going through a truffle phase ...) and it was brilliant -- probably smaller than I would have liked. If I had my time over, I'd have gone with the larger size. I feel like the small size pastas are designed for if you are eating ""Italian Style"" where you have starters, pasta and then secondi (main course).My friend had the carbonara, which he said was tasty without being exceptional. For the dessert I had the brownie with bourbon ice-cream. I felt the ice-cream could have had a bit more oomph to it in the bourbon sense but the dessert was tasty all the same.The things that made this place really stand out to me were:* Great friendly service, not being rushed out the door despite it being busy* Really funky décor - once you get inside they have some pretty cool design going on* Baked mushroom starter* Truffle tagliatelle* Price -- For two people it was a about £63, which from what I have seen in London is pretty damn cheap for 3 courses, a starter of bubbly and bottle of wine.Plan your trip to this place wisely and you will have a memorable evening."	went here with a workmate on a wednesday night  the key to this place is planning  the place is popular and they don t take reservations for groups less than 6  so plan to get there at least 45mins before you want to be seated  they will give you a buzzer pager and you can go have drinks somewhere nearby once you get past the tricky part of getting a table  you should be set for an evening of good service  good food and reasonable prices to start we had a glass of prosecco each and some truffled salami  fried squid with garlicky mayo and baked mushrooms the mushrooms were simply amazing and the truffled salami was pretty tasty too  the squid was good without being exceptional i was tossing up between two different bottles of wine to go with for our meal and was pleasantly surprised when the waiter simply offered to bring me a taste of both to see which i preferred  excellent for my main i had a small of the truffle tagliatelle  i know  i know  truffle salami  truffle pasta    i m going through a truffle phase      and it was brilliant    probably smaller than i would have liked  if i had my time over  i d have gone with the larger size  i feel like the small size pastas are designed for if you are eating  italian style  where you have starters  pasta and then secondi  main course  my friend had the carbonara  which he said was tasty without being exceptional  for the dessert i had the brownie with bourbon ice cream  i felt the ice cream could have had a bit more oomph to it in the bourbon sense but the dessert was tasty all the same the things that made this place really stand out to me were   great friendly service  not being rushed out the door despite it being busy  really funky d cor   once you get inside they have some pretty cool design going on  baked mushroom starter  truffle tagliatelle  price    for two people it was a about  63  which from what i have seen in london is pretty damn cheap for 3 courses  a starter of bubbly and bottle of wine plan your trip to this place wisely and you will have a memorable evening 
2411	4.0	Jamie shows off with some delicious modern takes on classic italian dishes. The appatizers were what really got me: delicous tappenade with mammoth olives and cauliflower fritters. The calimari sadly, left a lot to be desired, but the main dishes are great. The service is alos scary good- our waiter was fun to talk to and remembered all the orders of our huge group.The atmosphere is that of upper-class London dining, and is reflected in the quality of the food. However, you know me, I prefer a cheaper hole-in-the wall experience, and you certainly won't find that here, which is why I can only give it a 4. That being said, quality cheap italian is not the easiest to come by, and at Jamie Oliver's you know that what you are getting will be well prepared and delicious. The portions are nice too- just small enough that you can have an appatizer and not find yourself full to bursting. It's on the more touristy side, but if you can hack the chaos of covent garden, that won't bother you a bit!	jamie shows off with some delicious modern takes on classic italian dishes  the appatizers were what really got me  delicous tappenade with mammoth olives and cauliflower fritters  the calimari sadly  left a lot to be desired  but the main dishes are great  the service is alos scary good  our waiter was fun to talk to and remembered all the orders of our huge group the atmosphere is that of upper class london dining  and is reflected in the quality of the food  however  you know me  i prefer a cheaper hole in the wall experience  and you certainly won t find that here  which is why i can only give it a 4  that being said  quality cheap italian is not the easiest to come by  and at jamie oliver s you know that what you are getting will be well prepared and delicious  the portions are nice too  just small enough that you can have an appatizer and not find yourself full to bursting  it s on the more touristy side  but if you can hack the chaos of covent garden  that won t bother you a bit

But the tomatoes and mozz, crispy squid, and mushroom fritti were so good, I figured if there were ever a time to risk a non pasta entree this was it: Wild boar sausages with lentils. Out of this world. I choose lentils over pasta? C'mon. Not a second of regret. Plus I ate half my girls prawn linguine. Yoink. Tiramisu was the  perfect finish.Could a cost a dollar converter a lot more.

They also made him the house special pasta veggie version.They were so willing to prepare to our dining needs. That said, we did go in at 11:15pm on a Saturday night because when we tried to go around 5:45 it was a 90 min wait and they don't book reservations. I love this place. I want one in LA. YUM.

Not too hot, despite having scotch bonnet chillis in it.The next evening, I had the steak with funky chips and my partner had the wild truffle tagliatelle which he absolutely loved.Will be visiting the Glasgow branch very soon! Thouroughly recommend trying Jamie's Italian.	i enjoyed the food  prices and atmosphere in this place so much  i went 2 nights in a row on the first night i had a small portion of the meatballs  which were amazing  while my partner had the arrabiatta  not too hot  despite having scotch bonnet chillis in it the next evening  i had the steak with funky chips and my partner had the wild truffle tagliatelle which he absolutely loved will be visiting the glasgow branch very soon  thouroughly recommend trying jamie s italian 
2418	2.0	Honestly, I've had much better food in a smaller, lesser known cafes. Jamie Oliver is well known in the UK and pretty well known in the US so I was eager to try his restaurant. I had the nachos (basically fried ravioli) and the prawn linguine. I was expecting it to be amazing for the money I paid (it was $18 just for the pasta in USD) and I didn't feel like it was worth that money. The ingredients were fresh, yes, but the food wasn't as good I thought it'd be. I wouldn't go back again.	honestly  i ve had much better food in a smaller  lesser known cafes  jamie oliver is well known in the uk and pretty well known in the us so i was eager to try his restaurant  i had the nachos  basically fried ravioli  and the prawn linguine  i was expecting it to be amazing for the money i paid  it was  18 just for the pasta in usd  and i didn t feel like it was worth that money  the ingredients were fresh  yes  but the food wasn t as good i thought it d be  i wouldn t go back again 
2419	4.0	I agree with both the last two reviews (Lachlan and Patti). Three of us in our group ordered the bread and meat selection and then we all ordered two pasta plates and agreed that the truffle was the best. We also ordered three different desserts and all of them were very tasty. For me the restaurant was a trifecta - great food, atmosphere and service. When we were in Oxford the following day, we were surprised to find another Jamie's Italian and I guess not surprisingly the exact same great experience all around.	i agree with both the last two reviews  lachlan and patti   three of us in our group ordered the bread and meat selection and then we all ordered two pasta plates and agreed that the truffle was the best  we also ordered three different desserts and all of them were very tasty  for me the restaurant was a trifecta   great food  atmosphere and service  when we were in oxford the following day  we were surprised to find another jamie s italian and i guess not surprisingly the exact same great experience all around

2421	1.0	Came to the restaurant expecting Jamie Oliver style food, nothing fancy, just good tastes made simple with good tecnique like he does on TV. Since he has his name on the place I was hoping to get something he would be happy to serve himself.Got nothing near my expectations. Starter was a truffle risotto, it was wet, soggy and bland. Tasted more like a rice poridge then a risotto. The main corse was a daily special - Cod baked in aluminum foil with mussels, clams and tomato sauce. There was so much sand in the dish from the clams it was inpossible to eat. Besides the sand in the food this dish also was bland. Great service, but realy disapointing meal. Jamie wouldnt serve what we got to his worst enemy, why us?	came to the restaurant expecting jamie oliver style food  nothing fancy  just good tastes made simple with good tecnique like he does on tv  since he has his name on the place i was hoping to get something he would be happy to serve himself got nothing near my expectations  starter was a truffle risotto  it was wet  soggy and bland  tasted more like a rice poridge then a risotto  the main corse was a daily special   cod baked in aluminum foil with mussels  clams and tomato sauce  there was so much sand in the dish from the clams it was inpossible to eat  besides the sand in the food this dish also was bland  great service  but realy disapointing meal  jamie wouldnt serve what we got to his worst enemy  why us 
2422	5.0	We went 3 times in a week. And I am not kidding.  Truth be told I was a little sick of it by the 3rd time, but it was excellent nonetheless. It is always packed out, so reservations will make it easier.  Everything on the menu that my group tried was absolutely delicious.  Stand outs include the pasta bolognese, the wild truffle tagliatelle, lamb chops and the aracini (fried wild mushroom risotto balls). The wine was also really good and fairly priced.  They use fresh quality ingredients and you can definitely taste it.We never had the pleasure of ordering dessert as we always stuffed our faces with the appetizers and mains, but I hope to rectify that sometime very soon.We always came in large groups, sans reservations and got in fairly quickly and had excellent service.  The prices are reasonable and the food is truly a knock out.

We had a 30 min. wait, but it was completely worth it.  We were even able to get drinks at the bar and enjoy them on the outdoor patio while we waited.  The George Street, Prosecco, and Raspberry Mojito were all wonderful. Seated at our table in the main floor dining area (there is also a downstairs), we continued the evening with a carafe of house red wine and a meat plank, which varies in size depending on the number of people partaking. So Good!!! For entrees, we each had pasta dishes with various meats and we were all extremely satsified. I am so pleased we went!!!	visiting from los angeles and stopped in with friends who live here  we had a 30 min  wait  but it was completely worth it   we were even able to get drinks at the bar and enjoy them on the outdoor patio while we waited   the george street  prosecco  and raspberry mojito were all wonderful  seated at our table in the main floor dining area  there is also a downstairs   we continued the evening with a carafe of house red wine and a meat plank  which varies in size depending on the number of people partaking  so good    for entrees  we each had pasta dishes with various meats and we were all extremely satsified  i am so pleased we went

""Pumpkin nachos with salsa"" were under-cooked and doughy, with a sauce which seemed just like plain tomato passata, lacking flavouring and seasoning.Had to skip the burger as it only came well-done due to ""health and safety"", ""because it's made out of mince and there could be bacteria"".Switched to the ribeye steak, which was actually a sirloin for £20, it was ok but unremarkable. Again we were advised to have it more cooked than we requested as it was ""a cheaper cut of meat and could be chewy"". That said it was decent meat, if not cheap for what it was.Service was hurried, clearing plates before both of us were finished.Overall a mediocre experience."	disappointing  walnut salad with 4 fragments of walnut  on top of 4 leaves of chicory and a little watercress   pumpkin nachos with salsa  were under cooked and doughy  with a sauce which seemed just like plain tomato passata  lacking flavouring and seasoning had to skip the burger as it only came well done due to  health and safety    because it s made out of mince and there could be bacteria  switched to the ribeye steak  which was actually a sirloin for  20  it was ok but unremarkable  again we were advised to have it more cooked than we requested as it was  a cheaper cut of meat and could be chewy   that said it was decent meat  if not cheap for what it was service was hurried  clearing plates before both of us were finished overall a mediocre experience

2429	1.0	After four days in London I had given up on the idea of finding good British food, and accepted that Italian seemed to be the way to go. We decided on this place for obvious reason's, and I had high hopes of one decent meal in London. Sadly this was not the case. The highlight of the meal was seeing the name on the entrance, after that I had nothing positive to say about the joint. Over priced and under flavoured, I say steer clear if you value your dollar.	after four days in london i had given up on the idea of finding good british food  and accepted that italian seemed to be the way to go  we decided on this place for obvious reason s  and i had high hopes of one decent meal in london  sadly this was not the case  the highlight of the meal was seeing the name on the entrance  after that i had nothing positive to say about the joint  over priced and under flavoured  i say steer clear if you value your dollar 
2430	3.0	A very busy Jamie's on a August evening was a bitter-sweet experience for me. On the plus side, the service was generally rapid, friendly and well-informed.  I love the décor which is interesting and unique, and the inability to book, although necessitating an hour-long wait, leads to an unpretentious atmosphere. Swaying towards a veggie dish for ethical reasons, I plumped for truffle risotto. As noted by another reviewer, it was bland, homogenous and deeply uninspiring. However, my companion's burger and wafer steaks were greedily (and wholly) consumed with a minimum of fuss so I believe they were satisfied. Even though I didn't enjoy the main, Jamie's still managed to win my favour, and I would go back, but not for risotto.	a very busy jamie s on a august evening was a bitter sweet experience for me  on the plus side  the service was generally rapid  friendly and well informed   i love the d cor which is interesting and unique  and the inability to book  although necessitating an hour long wait  leads to an unpretentious atmosphere  swaying towards a veggie dish for ethical reasons  i plumped for truffle risotto  as noted by another reviewer  it was bland  homogenous and deeply uninspiring  however  my companion s burger and wafer steaks were greedily  and wholly  consumed with a minimum of fuss so i believe they were satisfied  even though i didn t enjoy the main  jamie s still managed to win my favour  and i would go back  but not for risotto 
2431	2.0	Quite disappointing experience. They were out of the red organic house wine, so we went for a Chianti which was just average. They were out of the Jamie's Italian Burger, so I went for a tagliata which was dry and way overcooked (and when I asked for some olive oil, I was given a tasteless one). Finally, the lemon curd was too much lemon-tasting to be a really enjoyable dessert. Cute place, more than affordable prices, but food under expectations. Sorry.	quite disappointing experience  they were out of the red organic house wine  so we went for a chianti which was just average  they were out of the jamie s italian burger  so i went for a tagliata which was dry and way overcooked  and when i asked for some olive oil  i was given a tasteless one   finally  the lemon curd was too much lemon tasting to be a really enjoyable dessert  cute place  more than affordable prices  but food under expectations  sorry

Centrally located near Covent Garden and Leicester square.  The food is excellent - service is FAST and friendly.  Pasta dishes come in small/large portions for tasting.  We went to Jamie's 3 times in a week!!  I can't speak to the steak on the menu, but the pasta dishes were delicious!  The wine selection is decent and the wait was not too bad.When you have had enough of British food, and don't feel like Indian food in London....this is the perfect alternative."	i love london but i don t love the food in london   i have found a gem in a restaurant called  the square    wow   amazing food and service but at 80   110 pounds per person without wine   not an everyday option that is why i am so grateful to jamie s italian   centrally located near covent garden and leicester square   the food is excellent   service is fast and friendly   pasta dishes come in small large portions for tasting   we went to jamie s 3 times in a week    i can t speak to the steak on the menu  but the pasta dishes were delicious   the wine selection is decent and the wait was not too bad when you have had enough of british food  and don t feel like indian food in london    this is the perfect alternative

The worlds best olives were great and so were the crispy polenta chips.  This place was reasonably priced though which was a plus.	this restaurant was okay   dont order the pasta primavera  its loaded with garlic to the point where it was uneditable   we also had to send our calamari back for being overly salty   the service was slow and we had to wait a while to be sat at 930 on a wednesday night  the worlds best olives were great and so were the crispy polenta chips   this place was reasonably priced though which was a plus

2438	4.0	Got to Jamie's and heart sank when I saw the queue for a table, but left my name anyway and went off to meet my fellow diners in a local pub. 10 mins later they called with a table but when I said that I had literally walked in and bought a drink they said they would let me have the next available table. I didn't get a call so we walked over when we'd finished our drinks and they sat us straight away. What was great?The staff were very very good  friendly helpful and we weren't rushed at all. Ambiance of the restaurant was good and the experience was so good we definitely would go back.What was ok?The food was ok, not extraordinary but very nice  if it had been any other italian I would have been happy. At the end of the day, this isn't a high end restaurant  its an informal Italian with nice food and a great atmosphere.

2441	5.0	Much as it pains me to say, this place is pretty good! I didn't want to like anything to do with Jamie Oliver and his sprawling empire, but I'd happily take my parents to eat here. And if you know my parents you'll know this is a ringing endorsement. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty packed. The staff were lovely and took my number so we could mooch around Covent Garden for 20 minutes before they called to say the table was ready. It's a lively place with a bit of a canteen feel, super-efficient service and food which, as you'd expect, was nothing short of fantastic. We ordered as many of the small dishes as we could fit on the small table and loved every one, especially the lamb ravioli. Unfortunately there was no room for dessert. Definitely recommended by me.	much as it pains me to say  this place is pretty good  i didn t want to like anything to do with jamie oliver and his sprawling empire  but i d happily take my parents to eat here  and if you know my parents you ll know this is a ringing endorsement  we went on a saturday afternoon and the place was pretty packed  the staff were lovely and took my number so we could mooch around covent garden for 20 minutes before they called to say the table was ready  it s a lively place with a bit of a canteen feel  super efficient service and food which  as you d expect  was nothing short of fantastic  we ordered as many of the small dishes as we could fit on the small table and loved every one  especially the lamb ravioli  unfortunately there was no room for dessert  definitely recommended by me 
2442	5.0	I was keen to try Jamies Italian, but went there doubtful that a chain restaurant run by a celebrity chef would deliver all it promised.Have to say I was very impressed! Service was excellent, food presented with great care and style, good range of items on the menu and very reasonable prices - what more can you ask for! You will have to queue for a table, but we found that once seated we weren't rushed through the meal at all and had plenty of time to make meal choices and linger over wine and coffee. Pasta comes in two size options which is great if like me you'd rather have 3 small courses than 1 giant one. Only downside was that they'd sold out of Tiramisu, but the Choc tart was a delicious alternative.There's obviously been a lot of thought and attention to detail in the creation of the 'Jamies Italian' chain and while I can't speak for all, this Covent Garden location is certianly worth a visit.

Three of us were seated literally at a 2 seat table and they brought up another chair.  There was no room on the table for our 3 plates, glasses etc when our food came and our plates had to be at odd angles for us to eat. Two of us are very tall and couldn't help but be uncomfortable with leg room.  My salad had water all over the lettuce that diluted the dressing.  My pasta was literally standing in water as it wasn't drained.  The lemon cake was still good. My friends food didn't arrive together.  All in all it was supposed to be a celebratory last dinner and turned out to be uncomfortable, and poor service and food production.  I wouldn't go back.On the way home we passed Wagamama and wished we had gone there instead.	i have been to this restaurant twice   the first time was great   it had just opened  we waited about 20 minutes   excellent best humble green salad dressed well  pasta was delicious and the lemon cake divine   i was really impressed   when i returned to london 1 month later i took my two friends as a treat to end a great visit   it was awful  and it s the negative visits that last in your mind   mostly  because you are paying good money for an experience you could do better yourself   i ordered the exact same items because i loved them so much the first time   we waited 75 minutes for a table  but that was ok as we were expecting and excellent experience  three of us were seated literally at a 2 seat table and they brought up another chair   there was no room on the table for our 3 plates  glasses etc when our food came and our plates had to be at odd angles for us to eat  two of us are very tall and couldn t help but be uncomfortable with leg room   my salad had water all over the lettuce that diluted the dressing   my pasta was literally standing in water as it wasn t drained   the lemon cake was still good  my friends food didn t arrive together   all in all it was supposed to be a celebratory last dinner and turned out to be uncomfortable  and poor service and food production   i wouldn t go back on the way home we passed wagamama and wished we had gone there instead

Yes it technically IS a chain restaurant but its so much more than that. First night, I went with a group of friends and between us we had the angry nachos and the olives to start, meatballs, turbo fussilli arrabiata and wild truffle tagliatelle for main. The next night, I tried steak and had the funky chips, partner had the wild truffle tagliatelle. It was like cat nip haha he practically licked the plate. Everything was presented nicely and tasted AMAZING. The restaurant is huge, with a massive downstairs bit as well. Would return, no doubt about it.	could not fault this place  we went back the next night  the staff are extremely friendly and chatty  ok  the second night we had a wee bit of a sweary waitress but she was endearing  yes it technically is a chain restaurant but its so much more than that  first night  i went with a group of friends and between us we had the angry nachos and the olives to start  meatballs  turbo fussilli arrabiata and wild truffle tagliatelle for main  the next night  i tried steak and had the funky chips  partner had the wild truffle tagliatelle  it was like cat nip haha he practically licked the plate  everything was presented nicely and tasted amazing  the restaurant is huge  with a massive downstairs bit as well  would return  no doubt about it

2449	4.0	When my local friend suggested dinner here, I was a bit apprehensive because usually a celebrity chef's restaurant in America means ridiculous prices and mediocre food. She booked us a table in advance so we were seated very quickly downstairs. I noticed how packed this restaurant was as soon as we got to the front door. Took that as a good sign. We ordered a few appetizers, entrees and desserts (I can't remember what anymore but we were all quiet as we devoured the delicious meal). I finally learned what rocket is too. My mother raved about the tiramisu which surprised me since she doesn't even like tiramisu. The server was friendly, helpful, and as quick as she could be despite there not being any empty tables nearby. The restaurant wasn't insanely loud and I could hear my dinner companions just fine without shouting. I was surprised that the menu prices didn't make me want to cry (since we were picking up the tab). All in all, a wonderful place to share a meal and catch up with an old friend.	when my local friend suggested dinner here  i was a bit apprehensive because usually a celebrity chef s restaurant in america means ridiculous prices and mediocre food  she booked us a table in advance so we were seated very quickly downstairs  i noticed how packed this restaurant was as soon as we got to the front door  took that as a good sign  we ordered a few appetizers  entrees and desserts  i can t remember what anymore but we were all quiet as we devoured the delicious meal   i finally learned what rocket is too  my mother raved about the tiramisu which surprised me since she doesn t even like tiramisu  the server was friendly  helpful  and as quick as she could be despite there not being any empty tables nearby  the restaurant wasn t insanely loud and i could hear my dinner companions just fine without shouting  i was surprised that the menu prices didn t make me want to cry  since we were picking up the tab   all in all  a wonderful place to share a meal and catch up with an old friend

We had the Christmas special set menu and not anywhere on the menu did it indicate that everything would have nuts in. As a nut allergy sufferer that was not a good thing. I couldn't eat most of the sharer starter, the main was a lump of chicken on the bone that I couldn't find under a mass of soggy vegetables and the one dessert I thought wouldn't have nuts in had some almonds sprinkled on top. This was not a fine dining experience it was a mass of lots of not greatly cooked produce. It is a very manly restaurant I feel, whcih reflect Jamie's style I suppose, my fiance loved it. However I shall be avoiding any of his chains in the future and I suggest you do the same if you are female and prefer quality over quantity	well i was very disappointed with my whole experience  the service was amazing but the food was just pretty bland  we had the christmas special set menu and not anywhere on the menu did it indicate that everything would have nuts in  as a nut allergy sufferer that was not a good thing  i couldn t eat most of the sharer starter  the main was a lump of chicken on the bone that i couldn t find under a mass of soggy vegetables and the one dessert i thought wouldn t have nuts in had some almonds sprinkled on top  this was not a fine dining experience it was a mass of lots of not greatly cooked produce  it is a very manly restaurant i feel  whcih reflect jamie s style i suppose  my fiance loved it  however i shall be avoiding any of his chains in the future and i suggest you do the same if you are female and prefer quality over quantity

It was very very good, the quality of the ingredients was really excellent, we had some of the best tomatoes I've eaten in a long time accompanying the bruschetta. I hear the lamb chop lollipops are exceptional although they'd run out when we got there (it was quite late). Service was also friendly and efficient and they have a music policy that allows the staff to pick their favourites which resulted in a great mix of songs. Highly recommended and a great addition to the west end. It goes to show that a high quality can be maintained and prices kept reasonable even for a chain restaurant.	i have a new found respect for jamie oliver after eating here  jamie s wasn t on my extensive list of restaurants that i want to go to but a friend was keen to eat there as he d been before  it was very very good  the quality of the ingredients was really excellent  we had some of the best tomatoes i ve eaten in a long time accompanying the bruschetta  i hear the lamb chop lollipops are exceptional although they d run out when we got there  it was quite late   service was also friendly and efficient and they have a music policy that allows the staff to pick their favourites which resulted in a great mix of songs  highly recommended and a great addition to the west end  it goes to show that a high quality can be maintained and prices kept reasonable even for a chain restaurant
